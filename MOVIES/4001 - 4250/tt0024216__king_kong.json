Sure, there are fantasy films with far better special effects (THE MATRIX, JURASSIC PARK) better acting (the acting here is of the period!) but KING KONG is a film of tremendous excitement.  The suspense, pacing, sensuality, violence all adds up to a blood pumping experience.  We all read about the film's history, being made, released, censored, restored, and how it's been picked to itsy-bits by every arm-chair film \"expert\".\n\nWhat very few film-makers have focused on is the film-making itself in KING KONG.  It has superb build-up.  We are wondering what is on the island as we approach it.  Then we wonder what is behind the wall on the island. Then we wonder what gigantic beast is sharing that frightening jungle with the rescuers, trying to save Fay Wray.  The film is faultlessly edited.  Many scenes begin or end with people running for their lives.  Unneeded scenes just don't exsist (we go from Kong knocked out on Skull Island to his Broadway debut.  We don't need to see what happens inbetween!) then there's Max Steiner's perfect music score.  Before KONG, most music scores were borrowed snippets of classical or popular themes, but Steiner's score follows the action to an inch!  Also, he does a great number of abstract musical strokes (I.e the clash of drums when Kong beats the giant snake to it's death.  The lovely string piece that jumps to pulsating chase music in a milli-second.)  When I hear of a friend say they never saw this film, it's like hearing a child say they never had ice cream.

I had also always owned it, and had watched it on numerous occasions. Time went by without a watch for many, many years, as I lost interest in it for a awhile, and then later on, when I became more indulged in the film life, I saw it in my collection and decided it was time to freshen up on it. I popped it in and was ready to be overwhelmed with the memories of how great this film truly manages to hold up being over time.\n\nI thought this movie was overall just a really great and enjoyable little film that even though it was just meant for entertainment, ended up being so lovable and cherished, much more than I thought I would love and cherish it. What was really that bad about it, folks? I have heard a lot of negativity directed at this film for being a weak Dreamworks animation with practically no depth or originality. Depth? Originality? You were honestly looking for those qualities with Small Soldiers? Maybe if you would lighten up on it, you'd enjoy it for the truly fun and enticing film it is. Some I bet were already even doubting it from the start, which that's no way to enter with a film as lighthearted and good-willed as Small Soldiers.\n\nMost of the comedic antics were quite laughable, and that's laughable in the tasteful kind of way, especially the renovated Barbies and cowardliness of the Gorgonites. It completely entertains you, and it certainly keeps you interested through the whole movie with the fun characters and non-stop deliverance of toy warfare and excellent voice-overs. (I can't see anybody else voicing Chip Hazard better than Tommy Lee Jones now.) The fighting scenes were cool and amusing, and the script was pretty different and new, even though many think Dreamworks tries to silently and sneakily follow in the footsteps of previous Disney/Pixar films that are big hits, in this case, Toy Story.\n\nI don't see why this movie has the rating it does, for I thought a lot more people would've liked it better than this, but I guess not everybody can spot a great film when they see one. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I completely recommend it, because it is a nice little movie that I am honored to own. It is getting too much harsh treatment. I had loads of fun watching it, always have, and I'm sure you will too, in the right mood. Plus, I love the usage of the song \"Wannabe\" at the right time in this film; forever a Spice Girl fan.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Small Soldiers", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3867672857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2NjdiNzAtZGQ2Ny00MDJkLWE2MjQtZTJjYjlkZWIxZjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2NjdiNzAtZGQ2Ny00MDJkLWE2MjQtZTJjYjlkZWIxZjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:09:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0189144/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Cross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0189144?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Irwin Wayfair"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932971/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alexandra Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0932971?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ms. Kegel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0808376/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gregory Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0808376?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alan Abernathy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000379/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kirsten Dunst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0000379?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Christy Fimple"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0099113/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jonathan Bouck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0099113?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Brad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005174/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ann Magnuson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0005174?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Irene Abernathy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0367005/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Phil Hartman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0367005?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Phil Fimple"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000585/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Picardo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0000585?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ralph, Clean Room Technician"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001542/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jay Mohr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0001542?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Larry Benson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001459/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Denis Leary"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0001459?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gil Mars"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0588241/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dick Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0588241?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0808559/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jacob Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0808559?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Timmy Fimple"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242656/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kevin Dunn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0242656?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stuart Abernathy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0769446/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Wendy Schaal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0769446?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Marion Fimple"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0353869/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Archie Hahn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0122718/characters/nm0353869?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Satellite Dish Installer"}]}]}

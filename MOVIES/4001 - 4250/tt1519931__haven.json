There are more, but I'll stick to these as they are the ones that stand out most. b) Appeals to a mass audience; to follow up on that last point, given all that the show delivers, it's nearly (or even theoretically) impossible for any individual to enjoy SOME aspect of this show. It will draw you in for more. c) Location and Setting; The strong location backdrop and scene locations are hard to be beat with a series which relies almost entirely on a small Harbor Town...and a beautifully stunning one at that. Beaches, ocean, a marina, boardwalks, rocky Maine coastline (although filmed very close by in Canada) surrounded by thick forests makes it pleasurable to watch for the views alone. And the small harbour town, again, makes for a \"small town feel\" amongst the great cast of characters but also allows room for the outside to come in which can be good at the right time. And when this occurs, the show never fails to maintain its strong beliefs and appeal of the mysterious town of Haven. d) Great acting...a must in any TV or Film! e) Having a link to Stephen King and his novel \"The Colorado Kid\" definitely draws in even more viewers.\n\nAll in all, we need more shows like Haven!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "First Look Trailer for Season 5, Part 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1601090329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg5ODI0MTM3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQ5NTc5NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg5ODI0MTM3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQ5NTc5NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "First Look Trailer for Season 5, Part 2 of Haven on SyFy.", "uploadDate": "2015-10-07T08:18:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2448361/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emily Rose"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1519931/characters/nm2448361?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Audrey Parker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0050156/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eric Balfour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1519931/characters/nm0050156?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Duke Crocker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0243082/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Dunsworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1519931/characters/nm0243082?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dave Teagues"}, {"url": "#", "name": "52 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1674903/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lucas Bryant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1519931/characters/nm1674903?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nathan Wuornos"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0232195/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard Donat"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1519931/characters/nm0232195?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vince Teagues"}, {"url": "#", "name": "60 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0178581/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Adam Copeland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1519931/characters/nm0178581?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dwight Hendrickson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}]}

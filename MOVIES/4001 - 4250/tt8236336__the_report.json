It does not disclose anything we did not know before but it is shocking to see how much it was tried to be hidden. We got a lot of disclosure movies like this in the part and this is one of those that can be perfectly put in line with many classics off its kind. The acting was great. Adam Driver put so much energy into his role. It really shows. And even though not much back ground information or special character traits were developed for his role, he portrayed it on such a human and realistic way. Hands down one of the best best lead performances of the year so far. Annette Being was similar powerful. What made her performance was so special was the subtleness of it... not one of Bening's specialities as she is a very theatrical actress, but here she showed her calmer side and shows the same intensity as usual. I also enjoyed Jon Hamm and many of the other supporting players, there was not one weak performance. The screenplay was great, I only had some issues with the different time lines all the time, but it was effetely solved by working with colors. A really good lesson in recent history. Not dry at all, although it looks like it.

Oddly, I think it was more popular *after* it ended, once they started showing reruns all the time. That was when I got into it, and boy did it get me. More than any other program I've ever watched, Whose Line put me on the floor in fits of laughter. Ryan and Colin are two highly underrated geniuses of comedy, Wayne adds style and energy (not to mention hilarious musical comedy) where Ryan and Colin cannot, and who isn't a fan of the wonderful Laura Hall and her improvisational music? Drew Carey's biggest contribution was making the show happen, and trying to keep it going with Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza. He knew how many people loved Whose Line, and he did everything in his power to give it to us. So how well does this new show stack up against one of the funniest TV programs in American history?\n\nThe new show is everything we ever asked for. It's unbelievable to think that the original Whose Line started 15 years ago; aside from Colin's white hair(?), it feels just like the old show. The main difference is a new (nicer) stage, some new games like the Sideways Floor Scene, and a new host, Miss Aisha West. But the comedy is every bit as gut-busting as it was in its glory days. I made the mistake of trying to eat while watching the first two episodes. I came very close to having chicken breast come out my nose. Ryan and Colin are still in top form, Wayne hasn't lost a step, and with the cult status of Whose Line, they're getting some interesting guest stars.\n\nFans of Whose Line, our prayers have been answered.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi581417497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFhNGI5ZTktMWMxZS00OTdjLWIyNDAtNmUyZDY4MGE2OWFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFhNGI5ZTktMWMxZS00OTdjLWIyNDAtNmUyZDY4MGE2OWFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-10-04T23:49:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0595110/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Colin Mochrie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2919910/characters/nm0595110?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0830198/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ryan Stiles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2919910/characters/nm0830198?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Self"}, {"url": "#", "name": "147 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0355817/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Laura Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2919910/characters/nm0355817?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Self - Musician"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0878768/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aisha Tyler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2919910/characters/nm0878768?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103750/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wayne Brady"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2919910/characters/nm0103750?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Self"}, {"url": "#", "name": "147 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0852777/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Linda Taylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2919910/characters/nm0852777?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Self - Musician"}, {"url": "#", "name": "102 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}]}

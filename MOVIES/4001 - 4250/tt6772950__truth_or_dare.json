There were parts how ever where I would check how long was left and think 'you are kidding me it feels like iv been watching it for 3 hours'.\n\nI thought it would be worse than it was due to the fact I watched Fantasy Island first and hated it and this movie was both written and directed by the same people so I didn't have much hope. It did however suffer from the same issue as Fantasy Island like bad dialogue. I'm telling you this group of writers write like they are making a sitcom. If you put laugh tracks under some of the one liners that characters says you would have a sitcom. An unfunny sitcom but still. I also feel like they are tone deaf when it comes to like 'young people' today, they just go for archetypal character E.g Nerd, Bro, Good Girl ect and then add like random pop culture buzz words.\n\nThe CGI/Snapchat filter that they pasted over people's face in this movie was hilarious but it wasn't meant to be and what confuses me even more is one of the characters literally says \"it looks like a Snapchat filter\". So this was a conscious choice to make it look like this. Why?? It looks stupid and not scary at all.\n\n Even though I feel like iv been quite harsh to it I would say watch it. Like it's a bad movie but if you like bad movies that you can laugh at then you should watch it, I feel like you'd have a good time.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer With Commentary", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3933976601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U1ZGViZjEtMGJlYi00NDMzLThkNjMtMjFiZTY4NGQyOWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2U1ZGViZjEtMGJlYi00NDMzLThkNjMtMjFiZTY4NGQyOWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Writer-director Jeff Wadlow talks about casting Lucy Hale in 'Truth or Dare' and reveals some behind-the-scenes details.", "uploadDate": "2018-04-09T20:18:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1423955/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lucy Hale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm1423955?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Olivia Barron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6556997/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Violett Beane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm6556997?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Markie Cameron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1496115/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sophia Ali"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm1496115?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Penelope Amari"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2334994/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Landon Liboiron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm2334994?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carter"}, {"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm2334994?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sam Meehan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1059827/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tom Choi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm1059827?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Officer Han Chang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0199637/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gregg Daniel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm0199637?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Detective Kranis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6721063/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Vera Taylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm6721063?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Inez Reyes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397110/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Andrew Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm0397110?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Randall Himoff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0692677/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tyler Posey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm0692677?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lucas Moreno"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4861659/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hayden Szeto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm4861659?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brad Chang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1289173/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nolan Gerard Funk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm1289173?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tyson Curran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1348102/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sam Lerner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm1348102?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ronald 'Ronnie' Wakowski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4563780/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Aurora Perrineau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm4563780?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Giselle Hammond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0807501/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brady Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm0807501?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Roy Cameron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6734813/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ezmie Garcia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm6734813?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Young Inez"}, {"url": "/title/tt6772950/characters/nm6734813?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Inez's Granddaughter"}]}]}

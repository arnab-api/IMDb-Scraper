Both ID in 1995 and last years FOOTBALL FACTORY either failed to convince or just went down the familiar exploitative road of glamorising the buzz and thrill of violence.\n\nHOOLIGANS as the title suggests depicts what these aforementioned films centre upon with the added value of having a story and characters you care about. There's no avoiding the clich\u00e9's as the ranks of these organised gang members are portrayed as gangsters.\n\nSimilar to BBC's Gary Oldman drama THE FIRM broadcast in 1986 it also show the characters as normal members of society, family men with respectable jobs. FOOTBALL FACTORY took the extreme and unconvincing scenario that these weekend animals are florist's during the week which might be amusing but the subject matter of organised territorial football hooliganism needs to be given a serious look at.\n\nFortunately HOOLIGANS portrays this more realistically, sure there's the stereo types in designer clothes (The Chavs) as we call them now where loyalty, respect, revenge, dignity and pride are what they live for, not the enjoyment of the actual sport. This simply acts as the excuse to fight in a traditional gang warfare environment. The prospect of West Ham's cup tie with Millwall brings joy to the faces of both sets of fans.\n\nCasting Elijah Wood is a bold move, he looks like a Choirboy but this adds to the films main storyline of innocence corrupted. The acting is better than average, despite letting his cockney accent slip on occasions, Gang leader Charlie Hunnam shows a genuine mix of anger, aggression and compassion which holds the film together.\n\nThis won't win awards but it's refreshing to see a film finally tackling the subject matter that unfortunately has been a shameful factor of Britain's attitude towards football as we are constantly under threat of being disqualified from International tournaments due to the bad behaviour of soccer hooligans."}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi803974169", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzQ3OTkwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMzQ3OTkwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Green Street Hooligans", "uploadDate": "2014-07-11T14:55:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000704/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elijah Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm0000704?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt Buckner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001231/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Claire Forlani"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm0001231?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Shannon Dunham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339877/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Leo Gregory"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm0339877?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bovver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1240908/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kieran Bew"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm1240908?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1697755/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Christopher Hehir"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm1697755?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Keith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0564680/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ross McCall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm0564680?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1245863/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rafe Spall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm1245863?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Swill"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2112651/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Oliver Allison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm2112651?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ben Dunham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0402271/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Charlie Hunnam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm0402271?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pete Dunham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0912938/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Marc Warren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm0912938?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Steve Dunham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1052141/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Geoff Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm1052141?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tommy Hatcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0329094/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Henry Goodman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm0329094?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Carl Buckner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1066171/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Terence Jay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm1066171?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jeremy Van Holden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0691117/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Francis Pope"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm0691117?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ned"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1577754/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "David Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0385002/characters/nm1577754?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nigel"}]}]}

Granted, I've seen a lot of fun or interesting films that I definitely enjoyed, but this one really hits the mark in a way that others didn't. It transcends being entertaining and becomes its own sort of enigma. But I don't want to give the impression that it's hard to understand, because it certainly isn't. The plot is easy to follow (once you get used to the German accents), and each character has their own tendencies that you pick up on quickly, but I never quite knew what was about to happen. I was kept on my toes, or on the edge of my seat rather, and I appreciated how unpredictable it was.\n\nSet in Hamburg, Germany, it centers around a secret group of anti-terrorism operatives lead by G\u00fcnther Bachmann (Philip Seymour Hoffman). After coming across a brutally tortured Chechen immigrant who turns up in the local Islamic community, and is laying claim to his father's corrupt fortune, they attempt to establish his true identity and motives. And with the US taking close interest as well, it becomes a slow-burn thriller that unfolds with a huge amount of style and elegance.\n\nIt's the kind-of movie you'd want to curl up by the fireplace and watch on a cold December night. Hoffman (who is never not smoking a cigarette in this) delivers one of the best performances in his career, rivaling his role in Capote. And the direction by Anton Corbijn is outstanding, giving it a sharp and neat feel that carries throughout. The more I think about it, the more I like it. It's a definite must-see.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi261073945", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyODhmYjItOWFiYi00NWY1LTlhMzEtNTNjMDU1MDYyYWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyODhmYjItOWFiYi00NWY1LTlhMzEtNTNjMDU1MDYyYWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg", "description": "When a half-Chechen, half-Russian, brutally tortured immigrant turns up in Hamburg's Islamic community, laying claim to his father's ill gotten fortune, both German and US security agencies take a close interest: as the clock ticks down and the stakes rise, the race is on to establish this most wanted man's true identity - oppressed victim or destruction - bent extremist?", "uploadDate": "2014-07-01T08:19:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3732046/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Grigoriy Dobrygin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm3732046?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Issa Karpov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0259831/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Homayoun Ershadi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0259831?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Abdullah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2494529/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Neil Malik Abdullah"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm2494529?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Abdullah's Bodyguard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0117709/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Daniel Br\u00fchl"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0117709?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maximilian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0880518/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kostja Ullmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0880518?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rasheed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0943487/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Martin Wuttke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0943487?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "The Admiral"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0090674/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rainer Bock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0090674?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dieter Mohr"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0947975/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tamer Yigit"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0947975?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Melik Oktay"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000450/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Philip Seymour Hoffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0000450?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "G\u00fcnther Bachmann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1304635/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mehdi Dehbi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm1304635?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jamal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396125/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nina Hoss"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0396125?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Irna Frey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3043279/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Vicky Krieps"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm3043279?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Niki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4989871/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Franz Hartwig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm4989871?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Karl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2414404/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Vedat Erincin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm2414404?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Storekeeper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0015764/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Derya Alabora"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1972571/characters/nm0015764?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Leyla Oktay"}]}]}

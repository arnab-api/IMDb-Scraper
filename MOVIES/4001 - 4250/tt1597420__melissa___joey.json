Taylor Spreitler and Nick Robinson add fresh faces and believable characters to an already awesome cast. Love watching the characters develop and come into their own. They actually tackle everyday family issues but without having to revert to terribly fake conversations you often saw characters have in 90's sitcoms. I grew up learning more from Mr. Feeny than I did from most of my teachers until I got to College, this show gives me hope the world will be filled with more Aunt Mel's than Kim Kardashians.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Melissa & Joey: Season One, Part One", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2519314457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDUyOTEyNTAtNzJjZi00ZDgyLWI2NDQtN2U1OGRkMDgzNDkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDUyOTEyNTAtNzJjZi00ZDgyLWI2NDQtN2U1OGRkMDgzNDkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Melissa & Joey: Season One, Part One", "uploadDate": "2015-06-11T04:42:49Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004997/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Melissa Joan Hart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1597420/characters/nm0004997?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Melanie 'Mel' Burke"}, {"url": "#", "name": "104 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1837588/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Taylor Spreitler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1597420/characters/nm1837588?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lennox Scanlon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "104 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005129/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joey Lawrence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1597420/characters/nm0005129?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joseph 'Joe' Longo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "104 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3538718/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nick Robinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1597420/characters/nm3538718?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ryder Scanlon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "103 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}]}

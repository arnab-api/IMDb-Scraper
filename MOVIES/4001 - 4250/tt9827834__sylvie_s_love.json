Sylvie's Love is a pleasant romantic melodrama that itself captures the demands of changing times for those two worlds.\n\nAlthough the film embraces the old cliches to further its formula, Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) is a new woman of color, gladly leaving her father's record shop to become an assistant on a TV cooking show while still open to love, most prominently Robert (Nnamdi Asomugha), an aspiring sax player. Although tensions arise from two ambitious lovers is stock stuff in these dramas, Sylvie's Love has an authenticity that elevates the romance into effective drama, partly because writer/director Eugene Ashe guides Thompson and Asomugha to play their characters in the lower register-fewer tantrums, more realistic sensibility.\n\nIn fact, so modern is this throw-back romance that the relationship between Sylvie and Robert centers more on what they will do with their lives than on the outcome of their passion. While she struggles with leaving her dream job as a producer (a position rarely ever awarded a black woman at the time) or following his dream to play and eventually lead a combo.\n\nThe modern sensibility here is Black, Latinx folk finally getting the chance to equal their white counterparts, and they are faced with the same career decisions modern white couples face in moving on to career success. So, while the film offers up little in new sensibility, it does bring us to date on the enduring struggles for minorities in the good ol' US."}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Watch Now", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi68731161", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4ZTA5NjgtNTA3Yy00MjI3LTk4ZjctMDZlYTc3YjdiM2UyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA4ZTA5NjgtNTA3Yy00MjI3LTk4ZjctMDZlYTc3YjdiM2UyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A woman working at her father's record store in Harlem in the late 1950s meets an aspiring saxophone player.", "uploadDate": "2020-12-23T23:17:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1935086/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tessa Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm1935086?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sylvie Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519456/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eva Longoria"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm0519456?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carmen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3733434/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jemima Kirke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm3733434?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "The Countess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2074546/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Reg\u00e9-Jean Page"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm2074546?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chico Sweetney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2340475/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Raquel Horsford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm2340475?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Connie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0319826/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Erica Gimpel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm0319826?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Eunice Johnson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1018488/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Wendi McLendon-Covey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm1018488?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lucy Wolper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0714698/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Lance Reddick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm0714698?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mr. Jay"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3060479/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nnamdi Asomugha"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm3060479?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Halloway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3813115/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aja Naomi King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm3813115?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mona"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3052894/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tone Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm3052894?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dickie Brewster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3339236/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alano Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm3339236?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lacy Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0806613/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tucker Smallwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm0806613?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dr. Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1313656/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ryan Michelle Bathe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm1313656?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kate Spencer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8501716/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lotus Plummer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9827834/characters/nm8501716?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Michelle"}]}]}

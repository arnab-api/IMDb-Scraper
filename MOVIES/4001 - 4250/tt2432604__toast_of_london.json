I ran across Matt Berry and found his character from season 1 hilarious. I stumbled across \"The IT Crowd\" and Berry once again delivered. My wife and I are having a great time watching older or current British comedies and \"Toast\" is one of the funniest.\n\n\"Toast of London\" is a light hearted comedy with Berry playing an over the hill thespian, theater type whose always getting himself into a jam. Most things revolve around paying the bills, landing ny sort of acting/voice-over gig, sleazing around, or dealing with his family. Mix in a pathetic roommate who kills it, an agent, his stage nemesis (Ray \"fin\" Purchase), Purchase's wife, & Clem Fandango, and you have yourself a solid show. The actors are outstanding and the writing is cleaver enough to keep you engaged.\n\nThe one thing I hate about many British shows, they end too early. I know, it may be better to end strong but many of them leave me wanting more from the characters. Let the trail of Boosh characters lead me to more entertaining shows.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Channel 4 Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4153786649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU0NTEyZGItZTIwOS00MjJiLWIyNmYtZWNiNTYwNTI2MmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU0NTEyZGItZTIwOS00MjJiLWIyNmYtZWNiNTYwNTI2MmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Steven Toast, an eccentric middle aged actor with a chequered past, spends more time dealing with his problems off stage than performing on it.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-29T09:52:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1546196/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt Berry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2432604/characters/nm1546196?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steven Toast"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0533489/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Doon Mackichan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2432604/characters/nm0533489?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jane Plough"}, {"url": "#", "name": "18 episodes, 2013-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236071/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tim Downie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2432604/characters/nm0236071?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Danny Bear"}, {"url": "#", "name": "15 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0643322/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tracy Ann Oberman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2432604/characters/nm0643322?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mrs. Purchase"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0061106/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Bathurst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2432604/characters/nm0061106?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ed Howzer-Black"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3691746/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shazad Latif"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2432604/characters/nm3691746?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Clem Fandango"}, {"url": "#", "name": "16 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0668775/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Harry Peacock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2432604/characters/nm0668775?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ray Purchase"}, {"url": "#", "name": "15 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}]}

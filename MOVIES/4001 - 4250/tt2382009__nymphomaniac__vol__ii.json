It is less imaginative, less playful and less exuberant.\n\nWhat's missing most is the interaction between the two lead characters: sex addict Joe and her asexual rescuer Seligman. In the first part, their conversation was like ping pong: they exchanged stories and experiences - hers of a sexual nature, his about all kinds of things. The links and similarities between their seemingly different lives made the film so original and attractive. \n\nIn the second part however, it's mostly Joe who tells the stories. Seligman is reduced to a minor part, that of the patient listener. Only at a few occasions he really contributes something to the conversation, but after one of his stories, Joe remarks: 'I think this is one of your weakest digressions'. After that, he lets her do the talking. \n\nEven more than in the first part, Von Trier explores all kinds of (sexual) taboos. There's paedophilia (on which Joe has rather original but very wise views), interracial sex, sado-masochism, and all kinds of humiliation. In between, Von Trier also gives us his unorthodox thoughts on motherhood and feminism. \n\nAt several occasions, it's clear how we hear Von Trier speak through the words of his protagonist. There's a nice exchange of arguments about political correctness between Joe and Seligman. He thinks the word Negro shouldn't be used, out of respect for a part of society. She thinks that not allowing the use of certain words, is equal to forbidding certain thoughts. Political correctness is hypocrisy, she thinks. Coming from a man like Von Trier, who has committed his life to the combat against political correctness, this is a clear statement. The same goes for the scene where Joe, after having decided to attend a self help group for sex addicts, accuses the group leader of being a member of some sort of obscenity police. This is a clear message to all narrow-minded people who described 'Nymphomaniac' as porn, before having seen one second of it. \n\nBecause Von Trier so clearly has no respect for what society considers decent or proper, I was amazed by Seligmans feminist speech at the end of the film. He comforts Joe by pointing out that her behaviour as a nymphomaniac would probably be applauded if she had been a man. That a woman cannot dedicate her life to limitless sex, is proof of society's double standards. Of course this is true, but it sounds strange after so much scenes in which women are being degraded. \n\nAfter having seen Nymphomaniac part 1 and part 2, I am really curious about the director's cut. Is it just more explicit sex? I hope not, because showing genitals is clearly not what makes this film great. It's everything else that should make you want to go and see it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Nymphomaniac: Vol. II", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2242296345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU2NzZkZmItZmY0My00MTMxLTljODAtZGRmZDFmNmRkNjlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU2NzZkZmItZmY0My00MTMxLTljODAtZGRmZDFmNmRkNjlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Nymphomaniac: Vol. II", "uploadDate": "2018-10-04T17:13:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001250/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlotte Gainsbourg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0001250?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Joe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5237479/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stacy Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm5237479?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Young Joe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000225/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Christian Slater"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0000225?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Joe's Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000235/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Uma Thurman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0000235?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mrs. H"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5301405/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mia Goth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm5301405?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "P"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0664203/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Michael Pas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0664203?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Old Jer\u00f4me"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001424/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Udo Kier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0001424?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "The Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6364543/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Morgan Hartley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm6364543?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "B - 12 Years"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001745/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0001745?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Seligman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0479471/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shia LaBeouf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0479471?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jer\u00f4me"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068260/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jamie Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0068260?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "K"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000353/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Willem Dafoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0000353?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "L"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4080531/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sophie Kennedy Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm4080531?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "B"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000852/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jean-Marc Barr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm0000852?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Debtor Gentleman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6174040/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ananya Berg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2382009/characters/nm6174040?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Joe - 10 Years"}]}]}

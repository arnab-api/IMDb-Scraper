With Governmental pressure on them to show results, Sebastian decides he will be the first human to try the formula.  He becomes invisible for a short time, however efforts to bring him back fail and he finds himself stuck.  As work continues on the formula, the others in the lab begin to notice him becoming increasingly unhinged.\n\nFrom director Verhoven the norm is to expect great special effects and violence.  He has also been known to integrate themes and good stories into these mainly effects driven films.  On this occasion however he fails to really do that and is left with a fast paced and enjoyable film that makes up in effects what it lacks in substance.  The plot is pretty basic and never goes deeper \u0096 Sebastian's descent into madness is not really a descent so much as a short trip that is not really built to so much as just delivered.  In it's placed though, the effects are really impressive and make the film worth seeing simply because, not only are they great, but they are also used very well in the action rather than just being the film in themselves.\n\nThe cast is OK but don't really have much to work with in terms of material. Bacon is much more interesting when not on screen than when he is.  His character is too thin and he fails to portray any sort of `descent' in his character's behaviour.  Shue is pretty good and seems to enjoy running round with a flamethrower.  The rest of the cast are OK but basically just act as fodder in the way that a normal slasher movie will have actors to be disposed of as the film rolls.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this film as it is a very expensive special effects movie which relies on spectacle to keep things moving.  The effects are great and take the mind away from the lack of real substance and the action at the end is very enjoyable.  A really good special effects movie as long as you don't expect anything more."}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hollow Man", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi828351513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc4MDhlZDYtOGE4NC00YmI5LThmZjktNWVjZDgwMGI0YzE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc4MDhlZDYtOGE4NC00YmI5LThmZjktNWVjZDgwMGI0YzE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Hollow Man", "uploadDate": "2012-11-02T03:16:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000223/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elisabeth Shue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0000223?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Linda McKay"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000982/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josh Brolin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0000982?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matthew Kensington"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342399/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Greg Grunberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0342399?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Carter Abbey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0709824/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Randle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0709824?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Janice Walton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0593961/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rhona Mitra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0593961?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sebastian's Neighbor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0741558/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Margot Rose"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0741558?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Kramer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0769027/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeffrey Scaperrotta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0769027?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Boy in Car"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0779425/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kelli Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0779425?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000102/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kevin Bacon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0000102?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sebastian Caine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0225332/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kim Dickens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0225332?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sarah Kennedy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0806217/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joey Slotnick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0806217?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Frank Chase"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001137/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "William Devane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0001137?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Kramer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0261021/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pablo Espinosa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0164052/characters/nm0261021?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Warehouse Guard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0803765/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jimmie F.

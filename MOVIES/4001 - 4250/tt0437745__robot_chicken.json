If you're offended easily, or have something against simple, ridiculous comedy then this show probably isn't for you. But if you're a fan of any of Cartoon Networks \"Adult Swim\" cartoons in general, I can guarantee that you're going to love this one. In fact, if you're anything like me I've only seen the first few episodes that have aired, but I'm already very anxiously awaiting to see more. I'm already hoping that after season 1 is over, they'll release it on DVD so I can show this crazy stuff to everyone I know."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 9 Comic-Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3905927449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmViYTVkYmEtOWE3MC00MDQ0LTk0MTgtMjlhMzQ4MGU2YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmViYTVkYmEtOWE3MC00MDQ0LTk0MTgtMjlhMzQ4MGU2YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the Season 9 Trailer that \"Robot Chicken\" brought to Comic-Con 2017.", "uploadDate": "2017-07-21T23:36:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001293/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Seth Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0437745/characters/nm0001293?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Various"}, {"url": "#", "name": "206 episodes, 2005-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005227/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Breckin Meyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0437745/characters/nm0005227?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Superman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "107 episodes, 2005-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1803552/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matthew Senreich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0437745/characters/nm1803552?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Man"}, {"url": "#", "name": "140 episodes, 2005-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1802814/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tom Root"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0437745/characters/nm1802814?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Various"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 2005-2020"}]}]}

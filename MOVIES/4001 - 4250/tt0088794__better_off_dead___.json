But disarmingly so.", "reviewBody": "John Cusack's girlfriend has just dumped him for the biggest jerk in school, and John deals with the depression, anger, and frustration in humorous ways. Slowly, he finds himself bonding with French exchange student Diane Franklin, a beautiful and clever young woman, that helps to build up Cusack's self-image so he can win his girlfriend back.\n\nBetter Off Dead follows a familiar basic storyline. Main likeable character is dealt a bad hand in life, pulls themselves up by their bootstraps, and ends up triumphing over the people who pushed them down. This formula led to such films as \"Animal House\", \"Revenge of the Nerds\", and \"Porky's\". Not that these films are bad, they are just similar in basic plot.\n\n Better Off Dead however, adds a bizarre surreal quality unaccomplished by these other films. Perhaps this is due to the claymation hamburger sequence, or the unlikely skiing competition at the end of the film.\n\nOr perhaps it's due to the parade of familiar faces from other 80's films. John Cusack's best friend is none other than Curtis Armstrong, best known as \"Booger\" in the Revenge of the Nerds movies. Next door neighbor and consummate slob Dan Schneider is recognizable as \"Dennis\" from the TV show \"Head of the Class\". Cusack's boss at the fast food joint is played by Chuck Wallace, the title character from \"Porky's\". And with a bit part, yet one the funniest in the whole film, Yano Anaya reprises his \"Grover Dill\" persona from \"A Christmas Story\" in the form of a vengeful paperboy. I WANT MY TWO DOLLARS!!!!\n\nAlso has some of the funniest lines in 80's teen comedy, such as Franklin's accidental misuse of the word \"testicles\", and the comment made by an onlooker when Cusack tumbles into a trash truck. \n\nDefinitely better than the majority of 1980's teen comedies.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Better Off Dead", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4281383961", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJhYjU3YTctMDg1OS00YTRlLTgyZmMtNmY3ZTc4NGM5OTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJhYjU3YTctMDg1OS00YTRlLTgyZmMtNmY3ZTc4NGM5OTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-06-08T17:02:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000131/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Cusack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0000131?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lane Meyer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0200981/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kim Darby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0200981?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jenny Meyer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0828766/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Scooter Stevens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0828766?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Badger Meyer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0913941/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Laura Waterbury"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0913941?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mrs. Smith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0645785/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Yuji Okumoto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0645785?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Yee Sook Ree"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0593228/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chuck Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0593228?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rocko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035664/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Curtis Armstrong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0035664?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Charles De Mar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0042740/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Frank Burt Avalon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0042740?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Roy's Ski Buddy #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001773/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Ogden Stiers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0001773?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Al Meyer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0805164/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Demian Slade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0805164?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Johnny Gasparini"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0291404/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Diane Franklin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0291404?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Monique Junot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0773759/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dan Schneider"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0773759?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ricky Smith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0407999/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Brian Imada"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0407999?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chen Ree"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0944143/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Amanda Wyss"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0944143?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Beth Truss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236535/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Aaron Dozier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088794/characters/nm0236535?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Roy Stalin"}]}]}

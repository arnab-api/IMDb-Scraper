With Ann co-producing and Seth also involved, I can't wait for the rest of the episodes. All in all, 10/10 for the show. Bringing astronomy and science to everyone, Neil was the most apt person to do this. Tip: watch in 720p or higher only because the visuals are brilliant. They tried to take some elements from the 1980 Cosmos, which is noticeable. Also Seth's influence is noticeable, with a few animations. The music at times was suiting the mood, and felt modern.

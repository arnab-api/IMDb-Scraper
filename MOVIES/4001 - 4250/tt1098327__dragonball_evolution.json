The characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. I wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime, as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. It almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. The only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about Master Roshi and Yamcha.\n\nFor one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. I can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. Its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with Goku and the \"bullies\" is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. The big screen debut of the Kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the Ki blasts look like different color fire balls. They don't look pure energy (like they are in the anime) but just like slow motion fire.\n\nI could go on for hours about what they did wrong. If you have never seen the anime series don't watch the movie. The story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesn't know the entire back-story of the anime. The movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. In fact i think why sums up the entire movie. Why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. At the end of the movie all i could do was ask \"Why did they make this movie and who did they make this movie for?\" This is not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. It feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime.\n\nAs a fan of the series I will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Dragonball Evolution: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1228800793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwNjAxMTkzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk4NjAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwNjAxMTkzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk4NjAzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The young warrior Son Goku sets out on a quest, racing against time and the vengeful King Piccolo, to collect a set of seven magical orbs that will grant their wielder unlimited power.", "uploadDate": "2009-02-07T12:29:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0154226/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Justin Chatwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0154226?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Goku"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002536/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Emmy Rossum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0002536?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bulma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0551346/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "James Marsters"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0551346?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lord Piccolo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848772/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Eriko Tamura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0848772?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001368/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ernie Hudson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0001368?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sifu Norris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1934349/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Megumi Seki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm1934349?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Seki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0086703/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Richard Blake"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0086703?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Agundes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0883693/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rafael Valdez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0883693?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Butler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000334/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Yun-Fat Chow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0000334?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Roshi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1512166/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jamie Chung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm1512166?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chi Chi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2684445/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joon Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm2684445?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Yamcha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0453641/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Randall Duk Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0453641?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gohan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1564024/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Texas Battle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm1564024?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Carey Fuller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1613839/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ian Whyte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm1613839?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Oozaru"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0884497/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jon Valera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1098327/characters/nm0884497?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Moreno"}]}]}

A number of men in the bar were cheering the attackers on and after the victim escaped into the street, they continued drinking and joking about the incident.\n\nMs. Araujo, 21, and all four of her assailants were Portuguese, a major ethnicity in former New England \"mill towns\" like New Bedford.  The Portuguese community sided with its errant sons, rather than their victim, and Cheryl Araujo was basically driven out of town by the animosity of her neighbors.  She was killed in an automobile accident in Florida in 1986, leaving behind two children.\n\nThis film was loosely based on the Araujo case.  Several of Jodie Foster's scenes were so powerful they nearly brought me to tears -- specifically, the scene where she confronts lawyer Kelly McGillis in the latter's apartment during a dinner party; her courtroom testimony; and the horrifying rape scene.\n\nKelly McGillis seemed to be sleepwalking through this entire film, with only a few moments when she roused herself a bit, but not enough to help.  Even so, she appeared more sensitive than the volunteer from the rape crisis center, who stood NEXT TO the ER doctor during the post-assault pelvic exam. If I had been on that table, I'd have wrenched a foot out of the stirrups and kicked her.  A woman who has just been gang raped doesn't need one more person invading her privacy.\n\nI agree with an earlier poster who noted the difficult roles of the \"cheer and clap\" trio.  It must have been extremely challenging for a guy who has any sensitivity at all about women to convincingly portray the kind of jerks those three were.  My hat's off to all three of them."}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi678411801", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E3ZWE0ZDEtNDlkZi00Zjk5LTg5NzMtODI5YjkzMGYzMDJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E3ZWE0ZDEtNDlkZi00Zjk5LTg5NzMtODI5YjkzMGYzMDJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-07T21:42:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000534/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kelly McGillis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0000534?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kathryn Murphy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0183464/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bernie Coulson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0183464?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ken Joyce"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372475/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ann Hearn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0372475?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sally Fraser"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0031078/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Steve Antin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0031078?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bob Joiner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0887592/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Peter Van Norden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0887592?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Attorney Paulsen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0101427/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Woody Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0101427?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Danny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0464940/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kim Kondrashoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0464940?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kurt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372784/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tom Heaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0372784?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bartender Jesse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000149/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jodie Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0000149?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sarah Tobias"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0744235/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Leo Rossi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0744235?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cliff 'Scorpion' Albrect"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0034492/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Carmen Argenziano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094608/characters/nm0034492?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "D.A.

The combination of good acting, nice storylines and intriguing court cases makes this series very interesting to watch.\n\nBasically, \"The Practice\" is a drama about an unlikely group of lawyers that run a small law firm. Most remarkable is that these lawyers aren't all played by the usual super-handsome actors, but by people that might actually pass for lawyers in real life. This group of lawyers undergoes the usual array of romances, personal setbacks, and quarrels like in any drama serie. Nothing special, but certainly entertaining, and more importantly, almost always believable (as opposed to soap opera's where the most implausible things happen to the most implausible people all the time)\n\nThe real meat of the series, however, are the court cases, of which there are usually two to three in one episode. These are almost always creative, believable (nothing like the nonsensical cases in \"Ally McBeal\") and intriguing and often really make me think: \"what would I do if I were the lawyer, judge, or juror?\". Any series or movie that makes me actually think about ethical dilemma's (or anything else, for that matter) scores bonus points in my book. OK, so maybe the small law firm wins a little too many cases, and maybe they take the \"moral high ground\" a bit too often, but this doesn't really detract from the enjoyment.\n\n\"The Practice\" combines enjoyable drama elements with some well thought-out and intriguing court cases into a formula that doesn't get old fast.

They are going to be working overtime to convince us to suspend belief. Well, it wasn't perfect, but honestly I thought they did a pretty decent job. I've seen far worse acting in billion dollar franchise films that for some reason nobody can grow a pair and point out in their reviews.\n\nJillian Bell was so fun to watch and without that the film just wouldn't have worked at all. I'm not saying the others don't matter, but since she is the focal point a certain energy level is required.\n\nAbout the only fault I have with the film is the speed at which everyone is on board with what is going on. I think they should have provided a tiny bit more exposition in that area.\n\nSo sit back and let this warm your cockles.

Ledger's performance is good, as one would expect, but he has done better and more iconic roles. The problem faced by his death occurring before filming completed is overcome easily and one would not necessarily know that Ledger had died just from the evidence of the film. There is a fitting tribute to him in the film, as Johnny Depp's version of Heath Ledger's character comments on how celebrities who died young will live on forever.\n\nHowever, this film deserves to be discussed as a piece of work on its own. Like many of Terry Gilliam's films it is both complex and imaginative. The titular Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) operates a mostly unsuccessful travelling show where he hopes to send members of the public through a magic mirror into the Imaginarium where they will ultimately face a choice between giving their soul to Parnassus or the Devil (Tom Waits). Those two are having a contest for the soul of Valentina (Lily Cole), the Doctor's daughter. Helping the Doctor's show are the lovelorn Anton, the dwarf Percy and Tony a mysterious stranger who can draw punters. \n\nInitially all these plot points work well. Doctor Parnassus is a desperate man who has almost given up hope, whilst the Devil is entertaining to watch, yet evidently devious. The heart of the film lies with Valentina who wants a normal life but is it unaware that it is far more complicated than just the raising of money. Unfortunately, the film runs into difficulty in the last third as the plot lines all come together and even more are added, creating a overly complex ending where nothing gets resolved properly. \n\nThe acting is good, with Lily Cole surprisingly impressive and old hands Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits leading by example. Terry Gilliam direction combines the fantastical and the ordinary in a way that only he can. It is the first time he has participated in the writing process for two decades and this film has an autobiographical feel as Doctor Parnassus tries to entice with stories and the imagination only to be met by cynical crowds. This effort to wow the public may not move them away from CGI and is short of his best, but it is still entertaining and favourable over films which lack charm, imagination and storytelling.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi944374297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDYxNDQ0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY3NTA5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDYxNDQ0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY3NTA5Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A story-telling doctor's deal with the devil sends him scrambling to save his daughter on the eve of her 16th birthday.", "uploadDate": "2009-10-14T12:18:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1940449/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Andrew Garfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm1940449?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Anton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1478846/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Richard Riddell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm1478846?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2202439/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richard Shanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm2202439?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Friend of Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0873942/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Verne Troyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm0873942?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Percy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364890/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Johnny Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm0364890?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Policeman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0072949/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mark Benton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm0072949?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2788907/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sian Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm2788907?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Linda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103696/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Moya Brady"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm0103696?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Aunty Flo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001626/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christopher Plummer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm0001626?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Doctor Parnassus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0529098/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Katie Lyons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm0529098?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Martin's Girlfriend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2178959/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lily Cole"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm2178959?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Valentina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2646478/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bruce Crawford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm2646478?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Face Changed Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0156194/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lorraine Cheshire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm0156194?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3729228/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lewis Gott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm3729228?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Diego"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206588/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Simon Day"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1054606/characters/nm0206588?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Uncle Bob"}]}]}

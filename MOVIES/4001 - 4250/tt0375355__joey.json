Lets not forget that in Friends he had 5 other main characters to fall back on and countless others. A lot of whats happened in Joey has been a reflection to what happened in the earlier seasons of Frasier. 1) A big move to a new city 2) Previously unseen family members crawl out of the woodwork 3) A new unavailable love interest.\n\nIt is obvious to me that the writers have looked to Seattles finest for inspiration, but i don't think so far that they've looked hard enough. When Frasier left Boston he had a change of direction in career which gave us the often hilarious radio phone-ins, the double act with Ros and a score of other brilliant minor characters (Bulldog, Kenny etc.) \n\nJoey on the other hand has the same life more or less just without Chandler and the others. Sequences of Joey on set which once took about 5 minutes of a Friends episodes these now are the basis for whole episodes. His contemporaries extend to his sister, nephew and neighbour and occasionally his agent(played by a horrifically over-the-top Jennifer Coolidge) this means he is continually conversing with the same few characters which can draw repetition.\n\nI only refer to Frasier so much as it it the benchmark for all spin-offs as it became arguably better than the original show Cheers. And for Joey to carry on it needs to flesh out its characters and its story.\n\nHowever i find no fault in the enthusiastic acting from the regular cast. Joey is the same lovable fool and Drea Di Matteo is brilliant in her role as Gina. Although i criticised the show quite heavily i enjoy every episode and really wish that Joey will be around for a long while. I just know how fickle audiences are and don't want joey to fall into the category of shows that could have done great but got cancelled.\n\nSean"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2473704985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJhNDI1YjAtMWI5OS00N2FiLThlYjItMzQzM2Y1ODRmMjA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJhNDI1YjAtMWI5OS00N2FiLThlYjItMzQzM2Y1ODRmMjA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-18T22:43:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001455/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt LeBlanc"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375355/characters/nm0001455?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Joey Tribbiani"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2004-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0182455/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paulo Costanzo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375355/characters/nm0182455?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Tribbiani"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2004-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005576/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Drea de Matteo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375355/characters/nm0005576?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gina Tribbiani"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2004-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1627969/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Andrea Anders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375355/characters/nm1627969?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alex Garrett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2004-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177639/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jennifer Coolidge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375355/characters/nm0177639?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bobbie Morganstern"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2004-2006"}]}]}

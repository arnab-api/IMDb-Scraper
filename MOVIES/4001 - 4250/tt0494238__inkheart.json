I thought he was a good actor anyway, but the moment he came on I had to stop and think \"wow!\", and I continued to be impressed throughout the film, as his character development just got more and more interesting. I felt far more sympathy with his character than Brendan Frasers (even though I think he's fantastic!), and I felt that he was the true 'main character' of the film (in the same way as Sam is to Lord of the Rings).\n\nIf anyone is unsure about seeing Inkheart, I would suggest that it is a must-see if only for Paul Bettany's absolutely stunning performance; he is intense, emotional, funny, troubled, heroic and just plain brilliant.\n\nAlso high praise for Helen Mirren and Jim Broadbent, who were very refreshing. I did feel more could have been done with Andy Serkis and Brendan Fraser, they didn't wow me as much as I'd expected.\n\nBut overall a very enjoyable film!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Inkheart: Music Video", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1905656601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMTIzNjQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI1NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMTIzNjQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI1NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Inkheart: Music Video", "uploadDate": "2008-12-03T15:31:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000409/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brendan Fraser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0000409?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1146916/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eliza Bennett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm1146916?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Meggie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0079273/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paul Bettany"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0079273?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dustfinger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0455057/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Matt King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0455057?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cockerell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0286044/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jamie Foreman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0286044?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Basta"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2657923/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mirabel O'Keefe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm2657923?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Young Meggie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0861027/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Thomson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0861027?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Darius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2462293/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tereza Srbova"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm2462293?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rapunzel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0347149/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sienna Guillory"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0347149?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Resa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0833380/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard Strange"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0833380?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bookshop Proprietor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000545/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Helen Mirren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0000545?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Elinor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818648/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Steve Speirs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0818648?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Flatnose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0334318/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stephen Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0334318?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Fulvio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785227/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Andy Serkis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0785227?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Capricorn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0789093/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lesley Sharp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0494238/characters/nm0789093?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mortola"}]}]}

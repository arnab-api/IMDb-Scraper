For me, it landed precisely at the very center of imdb's 10 point scale, right at 5.5. This means that I found exactly as much to like as I did to dislike. There is a bit of inspiration here, but just as much that's stolen from other better horror movies. If it had opted for tone and real fear instead of cheap shocks, the movie could have been great. The story is good enough that it could have been great if handled well. But we do live in these times, and, although there are scholars of the modern era who would try to have us believe that the current generation consists of a bunch of kids who get everything instantly and process it on a billion levels at once, the truth is indeed the exact opposite. No, there is no subtlety here. It would go over your average teenager's head in a heartbeat. Nope, better play it safe and provide us with a gruesome scene up front where a couple of dozen people are sliced in half by a loose cable during a ball. Gore is not scary. I did however produce a dry heave during this sequence, which is more than I can say for any other gore scene that I've viewed lately. As the gore accumulates, I began to appreciate the artistry that was put into the enormous number of deaths. These are some sickeningly creative people, let me tell you. Unfortunately, the director (or screenwriters or whoever) ruins any real potential by revealing every detail about what happened on the titular boat in a fast-motion sequence accompanied by techno music! It's the kind of moment where you just slap your head for the lack of talent involved. And then there was more stuff I liked. For example, the art direction is very impressive. The revelation of one character's identity, while not particularly surprising, is at least somewhat new. I give this film a 5/10, rounding down because I felt the final moment was a bit groan-inducing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Ghost Ship", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2794390041", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIzZTY4ZjgtMjMzZi00MjZlLTk4MWUtOTNhYWViZTJlNjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIzZTY4ZjgtMjMzZi00MjZlLTk4MWUtOTNhYWViZTJlNjg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Blu-Ray trailer for this mystery about an abandoned ship", "uploadDate": "2009-06-10T03:51:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000321/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gabriel Byrne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0000321?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Murphy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0253035/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ron Eldard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0253035?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dodge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0913460/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Isaiah Washington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0913460?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Greer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0881631/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Karl Urban"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0881631?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Munder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0720575/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Francesca Rettondini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0720575?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Francesca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0749459/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bob Ruggiero"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0749459?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Captain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1260161/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Adam Bieshaar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm1260161?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "First Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1260627/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jamie Giddens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm1260627?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Friendly Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000523/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Julianna Margulies"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0000523?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Epps"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004993/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Desmond Harrington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0004993?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ferriman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0227317/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alex Dimitriades"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0227317?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Santos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0115161/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Emily Browning"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0115161?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Katie Harwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0110311/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Boris Brkic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0110311?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chief Steward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0306759/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Iain Gardiner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0306759?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Purser"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0914956/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Cameron Watt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0288477/characters/nm0914956?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Second Officer"}]}]}

Daphne has never met her father, so she takes off for England to find him. She discovers he is in the middle of an election for some public office. Daphne has to choose between becoming what he wants her to be and staying true to herself.  And dad has to make a choice about what is really important.\n\nIn response to the reviewer who slammed the movie as being anti British, and saying it was trying to say the American way is better, that is utter nonesense.  This was not a typical British family--they were royalty and associated with people like them.  Do you suppose the real Queen would find someone like Daphne amusing? Daphne's boyfriend was a decent young man who was also a bit off the wall and his own person--but he was an ordinary English kid, not a member of any royal family.  There are circles here in America where Daphne's free spirit attitude would be frowned upon, too. Every country has \"classes\" that are snobbish and uptight and every country has \"Daphnes\"--good kids who just want to be themselves."}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "What a Girl Wants", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4059824409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI0NGQyNWMtNjgxZS00MzJmLWE3NDEtYmY2MzNkOWI1MDllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI0NGQyNWMtNjgxZS00MzJmLWE3NDEtYmY2MzNkOWI1MDllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:22:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000593/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kelly Preston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0000593?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Libby Reynolds"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000147/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Colin Firth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0000147?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Henry Dashwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000596/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jonathan Pryce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0000596?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alistair Payne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0338785/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "James Greene"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0338785?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Percy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0651747/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Steven Osborne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0651747?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Staff Member"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1408675/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tom Penn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm1408675?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Libby's Band Member"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1405310/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "James Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm1405310?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Libby's Band Member"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0870199/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stanley Townsend"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0870199?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bride's Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1346859/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Soleil McGhee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm1346859?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Young Daphne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0040586/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Eileen Atkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0040586?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jocelyn Dashwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0716276/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0716276?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sir John Dashwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004789/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Amanda Bynes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0004789?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Daphne Reynolds"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1408758/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mike Toller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm1408758?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Libby's Band Member"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1406678/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tom Goodfellow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm1406678?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Libby's Band Member"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0711248/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mindy Lee Raskin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286788/characters/nm0711248?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bride"}]}]}

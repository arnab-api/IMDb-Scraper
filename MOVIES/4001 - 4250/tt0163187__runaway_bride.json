Yes, the director and the two big name stars are the same as the film's 1990 counterpart, but even though the two films have striking and almost offensive similarities, Runaway Bride has a good enough story that I refuse to believe that it relied on the success of its predecessor. \n\nJulia Roberts is Maggie Carpenter, a hardware store owner (a laughable profession surpassed only by Denise Richards as a nuclear weapons specialist in The World Is Not Enough. Yeah RIGHT!), and Richard Gere is a newspaper columnist (Ike Graham) who has been fired for printing a supposedly false column about a woman who consistently runs out on her marriages. When he travels to the tiny town where she lives to learn more about her life and possibly get his job back, he finds that there is more to her than just a newspaper column. \n\nBy the end of the film, there is such a huge media hype about Maggie's wedding that it's a wonder that Ike wasn't honored for his 'false' column about her. Joan Cusack has never looked and acted better than she did in this movie, delivering a wonderful nasally performance that was strangely heartwarming. \n\nRunaway Bride had all kinds of wonderful scenes. I particularly liked the wedding rehearsal scene. The look on Christopher Meloni's face was priceless! There were so many good things about this film that I am able to overlook the superficial look of unoriginality. If you just look past the director and the two big names, the story itself is not at all like any other film. There will, of course, be the inevitable cynical comparisons to Pretty Woman, and these complaints are understandable, but people who condemn Runaway Bride as a rip-off of Pretty Woman or some sort of re-make are simply not looking at the film, but only at the names on the bill. This is a very good romantic comedy, and it should not be missed simply because of a superficial comparison to Pretty Woman.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Runaway Bride", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi377815321", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgyNTEyMDctMjc1Yy00NjUyLThlMDItMDI4MWZkMDMzNjNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgyNTEyMDctMjc1Yy00NjUyLThlMDItMDI4MWZkMDMzNjNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Runaway Bride", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:56:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000210/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Julia Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0000210?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maggie Carpenter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000349/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joan Cusack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0000349?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peggy Flemming"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001854/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rita Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0001854?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ellie Graham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005221/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Christopher Meloni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0005221?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Coach Bob Kelly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0737138/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Reg Rogers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0737138?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "George 'Bug Guy' Swilling"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0606623/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jane Morris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0606623?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Pressman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0550982/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kathleen Marshall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0550982?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cousin Cindy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0385726/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tom Hines"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0385726?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cory Flemming"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000152/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Richard Gere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0000152?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ike Graham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001185/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hector Elizondo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0001185?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Fisher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0233209/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paul Dooley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0233209?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Walter Carpenter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006610/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Donal Logue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0006610?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Priest Brian Norris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0891485/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Yul Vazquez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0891485?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dead Head Gill Chavez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0731359/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lisa Roberts Gillan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0731359?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Elaine from Manhattan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0771134/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jean Schertler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163187/characters/nm0771134?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Grandma"}]}]}

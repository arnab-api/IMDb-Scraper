However, this is more the tale of that obscure and almost once clich\u00e9' variety of gypsy that casts spells which reek turmoil and havoc. Not only on those who would come looking to her for charms and potions of salvation, but on her own cursed self.\n\nIt's a shame that many who are rating this on the low scale admittedly don't have the patience to let the elixir within it fully sink in by watching the series in its entirety. While it's true that for a majority of the modern audience it probably moves too slow and teases too much, there is more than a mediocre fortune to be had within the full season.\n\nWhat looks like little more than a story of a 40 something privileged woman who should have enough in her life to satisfy most people's desires, going through her own mid-life crisis, is in fact more of a 'dance of many veils' which eventually are almost all stripped away.\n\nAt the conclusion of the first season many of the questions that develop about our main character are answered. Although we are still left teetering precariously on a cliff which if we peer into our crystal ball, seems unlikely to have any other outcome than a very deep and destructive drop for everyone in its potential future season(s).\n\nA person could certainly do far worse in the psychological drama department. While not every line is the work of a master writer(s) and there are slightly contrived and silly plot devices peppered along the way, if juxtaposed this with a show such as \"The Path,\" Gypsy will at the least feel \"satisfying.\"\n\nAll in all, a fair series for those who love slow burn psychological dramas and whether you watch it with your significant other, friends, or by yourself, once it's over you'll find that this Gypsy's fortune is one you can turn your back on, or look forward to without giving up your firstborn.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1",

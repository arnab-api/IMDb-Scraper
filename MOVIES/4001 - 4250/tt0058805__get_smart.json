Throughout that decade it was on almost continuous repeat, and at least two generations of couch potatoes almost had the whole series memorized by the time they graduated high school. But you know what? Watch it today and it's STILL the funniest TV show EVER!\n\nNobody but Don Adams could have played Maxwell Smart. He IS Maxwell Smart! Adams comic timing and expressions are superb. It's a pity he hasn't gotten the recognition he deserves. Surrounded by the first rate Barbara Feldon ('99') and Edward Platt ('The Chief'), supported by a fabulous group of comic actors (particularly Bernie Kopell as Siegfried), and some talented guest stars (most unforgettable - Larry Storch as 'The Groovy Guru'!), and with consistently funny scripts, this show set a standard in comedy that is as good as, if not better than, much more \"respected\" shows like 'M.A.S.H.', 'Taxi' and 'Cheers'.\n\nForget the reunions, movies and attempts to revive 'Get Smart'. Just stick with the original and best \"grooovy baby\" Super Spy! There's nothing as hilarious as this show at its best! One of the greatest TV shows of all time."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "MeTV Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2745876761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwYmE3NzgtZGU0NC00NTI3LTgzNDQtOWFlZjZlMDU4NjkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwYmE3NzgtZGU0NC00NTI3LTgzNDQtOWFlZjZlMDU4NjkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Maxwell Smart, a highly intellectual but bumbling spy working for the CONTROL agency, battles the evil forces of rival spy agency KAOS with the help of his competent partner Agent 99.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-22T08:59:49Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0010915/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Don Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058805/characters/nm0010915?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maxwell Smart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 1965-1970"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686857/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edward Platt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058805/characters/nm0686857?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chief"}, {"url": "#", "name": "137 episodes, 1965-1970"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0271156/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Barbara Feldon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058805/characters/nm0271156?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "#99"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 1965-1970"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0440289/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robert Karvelas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058805/characters/nm0440289?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Larabee"}, {"url": "#", "name": "52 episodes, 1965-1970"}]}]}

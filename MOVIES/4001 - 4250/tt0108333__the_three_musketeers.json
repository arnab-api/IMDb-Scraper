Almost no movie touched by them is safe from this process. From cartoon production to live action films, any adaptation by Disney is going to have plot changes to suit there vision of the final product. For example, their cartoon The Sword in the Stone bears almost no resemblance to the original story of King Arthur.\n\nTo say that Disney does not stick to the original plot is like saying an elephant does not ride a bicycle. It is obvious, even before you see it, that this is not going to happen. This is why they are adaptations. The definition of adaptation is \"The condition of being made suitable to an end.\" Disney sets what they want the end product to be and adapt the story line to meet that goal. They did, however, remain close enough to the original story line that one who had not read the original might be intrigued enough to do so.\n\nThis movie was made for one reason... to entertain. Sure money was a motive, but if it does not entertain, it does not make money. And, as with most Disney adaptations, if you approach it with the understanding that liberties have been taken, it not only can entertain, but can be downright enjoyable as well. Disney will never fully stick to an original story line for any adaptation they produce. This is how they make it \"theirs\". This is how they give it that twist that a lot of people have come to expect from a Disney film. And once this IS expected going into the movie, you can watch it in the spirit in which it was released.\n\nAnd remember this, the cast all had the opportunity to read the script BEFORE they agreed to make the movie. If they had any qualms about the quality of the writing, you can be assured they would not have put their reputations on the line."}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000221/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlie Sheen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0000221?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aramis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000563/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chris O'Donnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0000563?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "D'Artagnan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000347/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tim Curry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0000347?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cardinal Richelieu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000270/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gabrielle Anwar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0000270?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Queen Anne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001524/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paul McGann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0001524?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Girard"}, {"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0001524?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jussac"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640560/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hugh O'Conor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0640560?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "King Louis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848883/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Philip Tan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0848883?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0030584/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Axel Anselm"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0030584?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Musketeer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000662/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kiefer Sutherland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0000662?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Athos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001624/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Oliver Platt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0001624?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Porthos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000360/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rebecca De Mornay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0000360?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Milady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000699/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Michael Wincott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0000699?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rochefort"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000365/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Julie Delpy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0000365?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Constance"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011478/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Christopher Adamson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0011478?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Henri"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496441/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Erwin Leder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108333/characters/nm0496441?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peasant"}]}]}

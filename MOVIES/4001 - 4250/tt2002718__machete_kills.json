Then came \"Machete\" (2010), an unapologetically violent spin off adapted by popular demand from one of the fake trailers that accompanied \"Grindhouse\".\n\nUnlike \"Grindhouse\", \"Machete\" was a commercial success, making 2 1/2 times its money back in domestic grosses alone. Inevitably, there would be a sequel. Because of how much I enjoyed \"Machete\", I was looking forward to \"Machete Kills\" (2013).\n\nUnfortunately, while the movie's predecessors were aware that they were both parodying and paying tribute to low budget schlock flicks, \"Machete Kills\" somehow forgets that fact. The over-the-top violence and sex is still there, but something still did not feel right as I was watching this film.\n\nThe movie starts out right as you get an allegedly fake trailer for \"Machete Kills Again . . . In Space\". In this \"preview\" (which may or may not actually get made in the near future), the film is grainy, scientifically unrealistic, and primarily fun to watch.\n\nThen the movie begins, and the film is as clear as crystal, the first indication that the director, Robert Rodriguez, somehow forgot what he was parodying. Based on the casting of supporting characters, Rodriguez may have also intended \"Machete Kills\" more as a second chance for once-prominent actors with now-notorious reputations than a tongue-in-cheek tribute to his love for fun, low-budget cinema.\n\nThe original \"Machete\" was no masterpiece, but it was enjoyable to watch because Danny Trejo played an appealing bad-ass, and the narrative was solid. In \"Machete Kills\", Danny Trejo somehow doesn't seem to be into the character he made his own, keeping the same inexpressive face throughout as if he is already bored with playing the character.\n\nThe story in this movie is also too simplified and hackneyed to accommodate as many supporting characters as it does. There's a terrorist who is about to launch a nuclear missile from Mexico to Washington, D.C., and is one of those villains who doesn't know what he wants to do with the world once he takes it over.\n\nWhile Trejo, Michelle Rodriguez, and others from the original movie make welcome returns to this sequel, so many characters are added to this story that their presence actually makes the story more confusing. There's a Miss Texas beauty pageant contestant (Amber Heard) who serves as both a femme fatale and almost an Agent Q to Machete, a brothel owner (Sofia Vergara) with an uninspired bra gun which has been done in countless movies and TV shows before, and a lone assassin who assumes many identities (including Lady Gaga) who wants to kill Machete for reasons the film doesn't seem to explain.\n\nIf you're going to accommodate that many characters, write a story where every character has more of a useful goal than \"Kill the hero\", or even \"Make a clever cameo\". While I thought it was clever to have Charlie Sheen be credited as Carlos Estevez (his birth name) in the beginning sequence, he served no purpose playing the President of the United States.\n\nIt's as if the screenwriters just said, \"Hey, you know what would be funny? Let's have a formerly legitimate actor whose life is a train wreck play the President!\" Sure, Sheen smokes, womanizes, and swears in his role, but those actions alone don't elicit more than a chuckle.\n\nOn the other hand, I bought into Mel Gibson playing Voz, the villainous operator of a weapons manufacturer who made the nuclear missile. Does Gibson's presence here show how fall the former A-lister has fallen? Maybe, but he still sold every line he spoke, and still showed his good acting days are not behind him.\n\nAs for the gratuitous violence, I was hoping for more irony in what I was watching. Machete doesn't seem to have more creative ways to use a large knife beside slashing it from right to left. Plus, any creative ways a nemesis dies seems to be ripped right from \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" cartoon on \"The Simpsons\".\n\nIf Robert Rodriguez decides to go ahead and make \"Machete Kills Again . . . In Space\", he needs to make sure there's enough room in the story for any celebrities whose careers he wants to revitalize. Plus, he needs to embrace the graininess of fun B-movies, and remember that even schlock fails without a coherent story.\n\nProbably foremost, he also needs to make sure Danny Trejo actually wants to reprise his role, because you got no indication of that desire here. Or, even better, give Michelle Rodriguez her own spin off as Luz, the Mexican revolutionary. Unlike Trejo, she actually seemed like she wanted to be there.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lady Gaga \"Aura\" Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi496085017", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExODE0MTUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTczMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExODE0MTUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTczMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The U.S. government recruits Machete to battle his way through Mexico in order to take down an arms dealer who looks to launch a weapon into space.", "uploadDate": "2013-10-05T07:44:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001803/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Danny Trejo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0001803?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Machete"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0065007/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Demi\u00e1n Bichir"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0065007?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mendez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0735442/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michelle Rodriguez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0735442?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Luz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000221/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Charlie Sheen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0000221?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mr. President"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000104/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Antonio Banderas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0000104?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "El Camale\u00f3n 4"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000421/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cuba Gooding Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0000421?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "El Camale\u00f3n 2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0891786/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Alexa PenaVega"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0891786?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "KillJoy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0767741/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tom Savini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0767741?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Osiris Amanapur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000154/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mel Gibson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0000154?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Voz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1720028/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Amber Heard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm1720028?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Miss San Antonio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005527/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sof\u00eda Vergara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0005527?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Desdemona"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3078932/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lady Gaga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm3078932?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "La Camale\u00f3n"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324658/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Walton Goggins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm0324658?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "El Camele\u00f3n 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1227814/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Vanessa Hudgens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm1227814?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cereza"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1047252/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Marko Zaror"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2002718/characters/nm1047252?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Zaror"}]}]}

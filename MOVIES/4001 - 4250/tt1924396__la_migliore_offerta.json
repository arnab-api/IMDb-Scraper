This is clearly the work of experts.", "reviewBody": "The only Guiseppe Tornatore film I've seen is Cinema Paradiso which is an absolute masterpiece. It surprises me that he was only in his early 30s when he directed it as the film already showed the work of an expert, given that his other films aren't as notable. The Best Offer, with its tight screenplay, lush sets, brilliant performance by Geoffrey Rush and beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, also exemplifies the sophisticated expertise filmmaking. It's refreshing to see a film with a unique universe grounded in the culture of our own with some bizarrely specific themes. While my only complaint is that the dialogue has this very \"written\" quality about it that is near impossible to deliver in a natural way, it's at least consistent throughout.\n\nThe story is constantly intriguing, held together by a Hitchcockian mystery feeling, and always pays off in a unique way. I'm not one for \"old man and young girl romance\" stories as they're rarely without uncomfortable perversion but The Best Offer completely justifies it with its well developed characters and themes. However, what makes this film so special and strange is the dramatic turn in the third act. Heartbreaking not only for the characters but for the audience that the film changes so drastically. But this is what made the film stick with me so much. It's wonderful to have a film that you toss and turn in your head, trying to figure out what it's all about. I can't divulge as anybody who hasn't seen it will be spoiled. Just go watch one of the best offers 2013 cinema has in store so far.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H11M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1299032089", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDQxMjIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU3MjAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDQxMjIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU3MjAyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A master auctioneer becomes obsessed with an extremely reclusive heiress who collects fine art.", "uploadDate": "2013-12-25T12:38:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001691/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Geoffrey Rush"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm0001691?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Virgil Oldman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1679778/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sylvia Hoeks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm1679778?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Claire Ibbetson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413946/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Philip Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm0413946?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Fred"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0973827/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kiruna Stamell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm0973827?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Girl in the Bar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5799949/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Caterina Capodilista"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm5799949?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Young Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5447123/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Klaus Tauber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm5447123?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Virgil's Assistant #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5031651/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Laurence Belgrave"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm5031651?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Virgil's Assistant #3"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0071007/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Benfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm0071007?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Barman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0836343/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jim Sturgess"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm0836343?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000661/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Donald Sutherland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm0000661?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Billy Whistler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0189720/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dermot Crowley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm0189720?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lambert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1493135/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Liya Kebede"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm1493135?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0786062/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gen Seto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm0786062?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Housekeeper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4181758/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Maximilian Dirr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm4181758?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Virgil's Assistant #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2772978/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sean Buchanan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1924396/characters/nm2772978?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Virgil's Assistant #4"}]}]}

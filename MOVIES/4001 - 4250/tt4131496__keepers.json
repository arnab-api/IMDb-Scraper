Or something more sinister as the men kill each other?\n\nYour guess is as good as mine.\n\nIn the real diary entry logged by the real keepers, they write about a terrible weather \"as the one they have never seen in 20 years at sea.\"\n\nThat particular entry in the book is extraordinary, having in consideration that weather reports at the time indicated that weather was fine and calmed and the first rain can in on december 17, 1900. That is baffling to say the least.\n\nWill we ever know what happened to those 3 scotish men, thomas, donald and james? sadly, most probably not, which is so sad, especially because they had wives and children.\n\nAbout the movie itself, i'd say its pretty good. i give it a 6.\n\nacting is excellent from the three main actors, as well as from the supporting characters. all did a good work, and the director set the grim tone right from the beginning.\n\nthe drama unfold with camera close to the faces of the actors to emphasis the tragedy going on, no images from the beauty of the ocean and a blue scotish sky don't expect to see that.\n\nall is sad from the very beginning and the only laughs occurred when donald and james found gold in the chest. other than that, all is grey.\n\ni'd recommend the movie to anyone who likes thrillers and tragedies on film. no special effects just plain good old fashioned acting (good actually) and an ending kind of predictable, still enjoyable (again if you like tragedies).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official UK Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4281907737", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRhZGUyNmMtOTYyNS00ZDhmLWEzNmMtODY5MjdmYzRhM2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRhZGUyNmMtOTYyNS00ZDhmLWEzNmMtODY5MjdmYzRhM2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Set on an uninhabited island 20 miles from the rugged Scottish coast, 'The Vanishing' tells the story of three lighthouse keepers (Gerard Butler, Peter Mullan, Connor Swindells) who stumble on something that isn't theirs to keep.

Expect a procession of jokes at the expensive of the main characters, fused with an simple storyline and that's exactly what to expect from a Farrelly brothers film.\n\nWoody Harrelson plays Roy Munson a washed bowler that had potential to be a professional Bowler but his dream comes to an end when he encounters Ernie McCracken, played to perfection by Bill Murray who ends up costing Roy Munson his bowling hand. Cut to mid-90's Roy is now an alcoholic, in serious debt. A chance meeting with Ishamel Boorg, played by Randy Quaid, an naive Amish man at a bowling alley leads to the pairs cross country trip to save both their respective futures. Along the way they met Claudia, played by Vanessa Angel, a tough talking con woman with her own mission. Together the three form an unbreakable bond and come face to face with their adversary Ernie McCracken.\n\nI like my comedy to be intelligent, and Kingpin is one of the few movies of its kind that actually makes me laugh. It made me laugh when I first saw it in 1996 it made me laugh till I was sore and now ten years on in 2006 it still makes me laugh. The cast are brilliant and it's their talents that really keep this comedy from dating. Randy Quaid is always solid, Vanessa Angel is devilish sexy and cunning, Woody Harrelson is suitably vexed and Bill Murray reminds us all why he has remained Hollywood's main comedy actor long since all his peers disappeared.\n\nKingpin is definitely for an adult audience and it is worth watching some night that there is nothing on the television or at the cinema. Not for all tastes but damn it is good and it is one of the Farrelly brothers better films in my opinion. 10 out of 10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi973258265", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjIwYWEzNGItNDJjNy00MDIwLWEyODEtMmVkNGY1ZDE0YTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjIwYWEzNGItNDJjNy00MDIwLWEyODEtMmVkNGY1ZDE0YTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A star bowler whose career was prematurely \"cut off\" hopes to ride a new prodigy to success and riches.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-07T09:46:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roy Munson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0029502/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vanessa Angel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0029502?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Claudia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0254402/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chris Elliott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0254402?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "The Gambler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0879186/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Richard Tyson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0879186?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Owner Of Stiffy's"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0315143/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Zen Gesner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0315143?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Thomas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0602813/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rob Moran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0602813?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Stanley Osmanski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0745194/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Will Rothhaar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0745194?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young Roy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269540/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Brad Faxon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0269540?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "1979 Bowling Buddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001642/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Randy Quaid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0001642?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ishmael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000195/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bill Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0000195?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ernie McCracken"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0430221/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "William Jordan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0430221?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Boorg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005417/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lin Shaye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0005417?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Landlady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0392009/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Prudence Wright Holmes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0392009?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mrs. Boorg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0338715/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Daniel Greene"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0338715?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Calvert Munson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0153444/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mark Charpentier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116778/characters/nm0153444?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "1979 Bowling Buddy"}]}]}

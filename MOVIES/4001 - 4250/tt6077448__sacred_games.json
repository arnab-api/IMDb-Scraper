In the book, Vikram chandra had explored each character in so much depth with different layers that to make a 3 hour Bollywood Flick would have been foremost a daunting task and secondary an injustice to the plot.\n\nEnter, Netflix. Having changed the Tele scene world over, no other production house would be more suited and daring than Netflix to take this Plot head on and do justice to it. And no other duo of Directors than Anurag Kashyap and Vikram Motwane to direct it with such finesse, style and daring.\n\nThe series is gripping, fascinating, dark, thought-provoking, chilling and so much more. It is also very relevant in today's India with its tense social and religious under-current. \n\nEvery actor is top-notch. The role is Bread & Butter for Nawazuddin Siddiqui and he owns every scene he is in. How badly I wanted Saif Ali Khan to prove himself once more after 'Langda Tyagi'. He is not only superb but you feel the amount of efforts he has put in the role. Also the actor playing 'Bunty Sharma' is the best among all the sub-characters.\n\nThe series is truly Binge-worthy and shows what can be achieved without the CBFC 'Big Brother' role. I am however quite sceptic of how it would be received by majority of the Indian audience who have been spoiled with mushy romantic genres and action for them is a muscular middle aged guy beating up 30 under-fed rowdies. I sincerely hope that this series results in a commercial success for all involved so that we can get to see more and more epic like this from our filmmakers.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating",

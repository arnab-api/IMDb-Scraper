She is asked by the police to aid in the search of a missing person and what follows, is a journey into the supernatural.  Sam Raimi knows how to set up a scene for the maximum scare potential.  Honed on his Evil Dead series, Raimi lets a scene begin slowly and allows the viewer to sense the dread and feel the suspense build.  There are visual tricks, interesting camera techniques and the fine performances by a very talented cast that propel this story forward.  Among this cast that really stands out is Keanu Reeves. People have always complained that Reeves brings down a movie.  At least some of the people I know.  I prefer to think that Reeves is an underrated actor.  In the role of Donny Barksdale, Reeves brings a certain menace to his character that usually isn't scene in his other roles. Barksdale isn't a creature of the night, or a space alien, but a flesh and blood creature that is capable of true evil.  When you watch him, look at his eyes and you'll see a true menace lurking behind those dark brown eyes. Cate Blanchett shows that she can master just about any accent that's out there.  She sounds like she's a native of the south and she has a quiet courage about her.  Most notable when she's squaring off against Reeves.  \n\nAll in all, The Gift is a wonderfully atmospheric thriller.  It has brains and doesn't insult the viewers.  It will keep you hooked up until the very end, and there are quite a few surprises throughout the film.  Highly entertaining, and very spooky at times.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Gift (2000)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3589407001", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3MTk4Y2ItNDQ3MS00YTg4LWJlODYtMzUyYjFkYzk5YWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3MTk4Y2ItNDQ3MS00YTg4LWJlODYtMzUyYjFkYzk5YWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:43:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000949/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cate Blanchett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0219699/characters/nm0000949?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Annie Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000206/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Keanu Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0219699/characters/nm0000206?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Donnie Barksdale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001427/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Greg Kinnear"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0219699/characters/nm0001427?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wayne Collins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005052/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Jeter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0219699/characters/nm0005052?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gerald Weems"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0170550/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gary Cole"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0219699/characters/nm0170550?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "David Duncan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0799777/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "J.K.

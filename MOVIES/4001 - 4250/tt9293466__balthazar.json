Ruggedly Handsome, in that Alpha Male way; not cookie cutter. Reminds me of young Jean-Paul Belmondo , which is the best. Not a baby boy. Yes, I am very taken with him. The woman Chief Inspector, good at her job, works well with B., is married, some sexual tension.\n\nBalthazar is a Paris Coroner and is out in the field with Police Detectives investing crimes, confronting criminals. The French have their own way of doing things- but I doubt this is realistic. when there is a crime investigation a Judge Magistrate is assigned to run the case; including evaluating evidence. It is rather efficient because the case is set up for prosecution, and all Court Orders originate from the supervising Judge. He doesn't take it to court- and is neutral like a Judge. Occasionally, more in S#2 the Captain is speaking to M. Prosecuteur, informing or getting permission, like warrant to search Magistrates from what I see in other French Police, like Spirals, are much more hands on.\n\nThe other thing is, that Balthazar's wife was murdered, 12 years earlier- not a spoiler, and the killer is never found. He talks to the dead (he knows, it's a conscious dialogue) . Is obsessed with his wife, and finding her killer- O.K. but they spend too much screen time on this; the 2 of them chatting, yes, it's him talking to himself, so it says what he is thinking, but still. He knows it's he who is creating her. it get's tiresome. We know, we get it. This is a drama after all. BTW- B. is very lively and has many girlfriends. season 2- I think they went off the rails the last 4 episode (10 in all); He is speaking more to dead victims, yes he knows it's his imagination, at first. I won't say, but I don't like it. A cliff hanger-\n\nThere is a season 3- Sometimes they do stupid things, which ruins the reality. small- it's action in a scene. B. grabs a crowbar to open a car trunk (a victim might be in it) the front driver's side door is open; this car is one that the lift up back is not separate from the back seat Hello, there is an open trunk switch. I don't like their choice of music most of the time, and often it's too loud. not always.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1340259865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM0MzI5YTMtOWE1NS00NzNhLWE4MDItN2EzZjA0NGI5YzczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM0MzI5YTMtOWE1NS00NzNhLWE4MDItN2EzZjA0NGI5YzczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-04-23T14:02:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0803037/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tomer Sisley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9293466/characters/nm0803037?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rapha\u00ebl Balthazar"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1559837/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Yannig Samot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9293466/characters/nm1559837?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Delgado"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1363886/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "C\u00f4me Levin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9293466/characters/nm1363886?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eddy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6356432/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Leslie Medina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9293466/characters/nm6356432?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maya Deval"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2019-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0288271/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Fougerolles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9293466/characters/nm0288271?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bach"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5477562/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Philypa Phoenix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9293466/characters/nm5477562?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Fatim"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4111888/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Pauline Cheviller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9293466/characters/nm4111888?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lise Castel"}, {"url": "#", "name": "18 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1572120/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Aliocha Itovich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9293466/characters/nm1572120?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Antoine Bach"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}]}

However, THE INCREDIBLE HULK ran for 5 years with only three regular cast members.  I am not sure if any other long running TV drama ever had a smaller cast.\n\nInterestingly, Bill Bixby's COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER co-star Brandon Cruz appeared in the first season of the HULK in the episode \"747.\"\n\nBixby oozed charm and charisma, and made believable the idea that he could so easily win trust and find employment in a new town each and every week.\n\nThe music was exceptional.  Among the best Hollywood TV has ever produced."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Incredible Hulk: The Complete Fourth Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2957949465", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWZkYmM3NDItMGFhYy00ZDdmLTkzMzYtYzBhNGIyYTQyY2EzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWZkYmM3NDItMGFhYy00ZDdmLTkzMzYtYzBhNGIyYTQyY2EzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Incredible Hulk: The Complete Fourth Season", "uploadDate": "2019-03-13T17:55:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0084642/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bill Bixby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077031/characters/nm0084642?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. David Banner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 1977-1982"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002073/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lou Ferrigno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077031/characters/nm0002073?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "The Incredible Hulk"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 1977-1982"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0173438/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jack Colvin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077031/characters/nm0173438?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jack McGee"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 1977-1982"}]}]}

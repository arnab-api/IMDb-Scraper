This show was definitely the one of the first ones to deal with single parenthood, but it dealt with it in a humorous manner.  This was also one of the few shows that survived a change in networks when it jumped from A.B.C. to rival C.B.S. in 1965.  And that wasn't the only change.  Like many other shows that year, it went from black and white to color.  However, unlike many other shows, it managed to make the transition very easily and, ironically, it stayed on for an additional seven years on C.B.S. as opposed to the five that it was on A.B.C..  However, one thing that really changed when it went through all those changes was the fact that many people said that the A.B.C. episodes were more adventurous and were often very surreal. Hopefully, one of these days both eras of this show will be released and the fans of the show will be able to choose for themselves."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "My Three Sons: Series Promo", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2453191705", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDE0Yzg0ZWQtMjgzNC00MTY4LWI5MTAtZmQ5YjE2ODA5MDRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDE0Yzg0ZWQtMjgzNC00MTY4LWI5MTAtZmQ5YjE2ODA5MDRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2019-06-13T17:11:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534045/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Fred MacMurray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053525/characters/nm0534045?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Douglas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "380 episodes, 1960-1972"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0333589/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Don Grady"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053525/characters/nm0333589?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robbie Douglas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "379 episodes, 1960-1972"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0218131/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "William Demarest"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053525/characters/nm0218131?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Uncle Charley O'Casey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "215 episodes, 1965-1972"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0292433/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "William Frawley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053525/characters/nm0292433?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Francis 'Bub' O'Casey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "165 episodes, 1960-1965"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0515301/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stanley Livingston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053525/characters/nm0515301?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chip Douglas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "380 episodes, 1960-1972"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0515225/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Barry Livingston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053525/characters/nm0515225?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ernie Thompson Douglas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "238 episodes, 1963-1972"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0175919/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tim Considine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053525/characters/nm0175919?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mike Douglas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "185 episodes, 1960-1965"}]}]}

He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, \u00fcber-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band's music videos. There's only one problem: he's not part of a band...yet. She agrees, and now Conor must deliver what he's promised and immersing himself in the vibrant rock music trends of the decade, he forms a band with a few lads, and the group pours their heart into writing lyrics and shooting videos.In a sea of opportunities ahead of them, what does the future hold for a love like this?\n\nPlus Points:\n\n1)Music: Sing Street is brilliant mostly because of its music.Much of the original music by the band \"Sing Street\" was composed by 80s veteran composer Gary Clark,which really gives us some nostalgic 80's rocking music with meaningful lyrics.For every 5 minutes a song always plays and it played a brilliant part in the movie.\"The Riddle of the Model\" is one of the best track from this movie.I loved the other tracks too.\n\n2)Performances: Newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is outstanding in his role and he surely has a bright future ahead.He surely is a Futurist:)When Conor gives an early Sing Street song called The Riddle of the Model to Raphina, he assures her: \"It's not about you. It's about another model I know.\" Walsh-Peelo delivers the line with just the right mixture of shyness and teenage petulance.The other one I liked in this movie is Mark McKenna who played the role Eamon who has talent to play any kind of instrument.Lucy Boynton is lovely.Especially during the shoot of The Riddle of the Model,her expressions are marvelous.Jack Reynor as Brendon is very good in his role.\n\n3)Screenplay and Direction: Sing Street has the most familiar plot for a musical drama but John Carney successfully made such a beautiful engaging drama with a perfect script.Sing Street is, in fact, a delightful coming-of-age tale that both celebrates young love and laments how quickly the fire of youth can be snuffed out. Director John Carney knows exactly how to mesh storytelling and music into his films.He is the next best after Damien Chazelle in directing a perfect musical picture.A great applause for Carney.\n\nSo,Sing Street is a delightful film that is almost impossible to watch without a smile on your face and tapping of your feet for its outstanding soundtrack.One of the best musicals in recent times.\n\nMy rating 8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sing Street", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3855792153", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhmZmVjZTktMjIyYi00OTg0LWE5MjItNzY3MmM5NWEzYzg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhmZmVjZTktMjIyYi00OTg0LWE5MjItNzY3MmM5NWEzYzg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Sing Street", "uploadDate": "2018-02-01T17:17:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6916321/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ferdia Walsh-Peelo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm6916321?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Conor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0448204/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Maria Doyle Kennedy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm0448204?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Penny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0318821/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aidan Gillen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm0318821?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7860900/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ben Carolan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm7860900?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Darren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7603308/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mark McKenna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm7603308?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eamon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0449048/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Des Keogh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm0449048?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brother Barnabas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4860644/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dolores Mullally"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm4860644?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dinner Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0687692/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Marcella Plunkett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm0687692?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Eamon's Mum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5801651/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kelly Thornton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm5801651?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2930503/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jack Reynor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm2930503?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brendan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2498053/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ian Kenny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm2498053?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Barry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7860901/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Percy Chamburuka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm7860901?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ngig"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0943614/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Don Wycherley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm0943614?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Brother Baxter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3912874/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kian Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm3912874?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mick Mahon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2377903/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lucy Boynton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3544112/characters/nm2377903?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Raphina"}]}]}

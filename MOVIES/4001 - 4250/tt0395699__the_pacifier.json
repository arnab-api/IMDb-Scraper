Sadly enough the only person who delivers anything close to good acting is Brad Garrett, who only has a guest appearance.\n\nThe movie is your typical \"badass comes to realize family is more important than whatever he is doing\" thing, which we have seen numerous of times before. Nothing new here, and with no acting talent the only thing that can possibly save the movie is humor.\n\nUnfortunately the humour is so childish even a 7 year old would be offended, and I can't recall laughing at all during the movie. It is just too cute, politically correct as well as over the top predictable.\n\nThe only reason to see the movie I can think of, saving having someone point a gun at your head, is hardcore fans of Vin Diesel might get a kick from just watching him move around on the screen or whatever. But this is just a sad piece of movie, clearly just a money making effort trying to capitalize on Vin Diesels name in a cute and proved family comedy concept that is way below par."}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Pacifier", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2491725337", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NjcxMDc2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI2MzMyMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NjcxMDc2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI2MzMyMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Pacifier", "uploadDate": "2016-10-05T08:27:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004874/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vin Diesel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm0004874?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Shane Wolfe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004933/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Faith Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm0004933?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julie Plummer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1302735/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Max Thieriot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm1302735?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Seth Plummer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001406/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carol Kane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm0001406?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Helga"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1352341/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Morgan York"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm1352341?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lulu Plummer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1763529/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Logan Hoover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm1763529?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peter Plummer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1798557/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Luke Vink"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm1798557?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Baby Tyler Plummer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0860690/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Scott Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm0860690?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Director"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0334179/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lauren Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm0334179?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Principal Claire Fletcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0811242/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brittany Snow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm0811242?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Zoe Plummer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0693243/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chris Potter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395699/characters/nm0693243?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Capt.

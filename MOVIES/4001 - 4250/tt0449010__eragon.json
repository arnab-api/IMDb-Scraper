More - Well, more\"", "reviewBody": "This quote gives a good review of the movie as a whole. I came into the theater with no prior knowledge of the books, and left with hardly anymore than when I entered. If not for the coffee I drank before the showing I would likely have been awakened an hour later by children applauding the movie they had been fooled into viewing. As Goldenduc has stated, the movie's scene-stealer was Saphira, the dragon whose above average animation and voice-acting carried the movie. Readers of the book(such as two of my fellow viewers who reported it horribly inaccurate) will be disappointed by the film's bad acting and poorly-paced chronology(Or may lie to themselves and give it a 10 like 41% of the voters thus far).\n\nThose who enjoyed the masterpiece book \"Eragon\" were most likely suspicious when the movie's rating was revealed as PG. As 6 to 12-year-olds filled the theater, older members of the audience felt an ominous chill that manifests before the start of a poor movie. From the moment the main character picks up his bow in the opening scene, you can sense the films bad filmography and quick pace will be it's downfall. Roughly ten minutes into the movie the main character's are introduced and killed-off or sent away. Soon after Saphira hatches and creates a false sense of hope that the movie may be saved. Before the audience was done \"Aww\"-ing at the cute dragonling, it transforms into a full-grown beast and its bond with it's rider is solidified. A few more poor actors are introduced and the \"Darkest Knight\"-esquire fumbles onward, sprinting through the most important parts and trudging through meaningless scenes. Before you know it the final (and first?) battle has been fought and won, and a miserable cliffhanger paves the way for a sequel movie-goers are sure to avoid.\n\nThe one upside to the movie was not it's namesake, but the dragon on which Eragon rides, Saphira. The dragon's animation is fluid and realistic(although not when Eragon is integrated) and its voice calming yet authoritative. However, like most of the movie, the dragons physical maturation and bond with it's rider goes by too fast and leaves the viewer with an unpleasant longing for more. The fact the intelligent dragon needs a rider in the first place may have fantasy-buffs in wonder.\n\nTo wrap-up it should be stated that the movie is rated PG for a reason, because there's just enough violence that it didn't make G. The constant new information is introduced to fast and is reminiscent of children role-playing(\"It's(the sword) a dragon killer!\" \"You must pierce a Shade in the heart to kill it.\" \"If a dragon's rider dies, so does the dragon\"). The erratic pace of the movie makes no sense, more time is spent showing Saphira learn to fly than is Eragon's time of mourning for his lost uncle. Overall, the movie earned 4 stars( of 10) for it's decent CGI and voice-acting, and the remaining 6 were stripped away due to lame pacing, bad acting and pseudo-logical fallacies that made you think \"Wait, what?\"", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Eragon", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2661613849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWY4NjE3MzItYjVlNy00YTY1LTk5YmItZTA3MDkyM2EzZWJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWY4NjE3MzItYjVlNy00YTY1LTk5YmItZTA3MDkyM2EzZWJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:01:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1968873/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ed Speleers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm1968873?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eragon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0347149/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sienna Guillory"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0347149?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Arya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000518/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Malkovich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0000518?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Galbatorix"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035605/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alun Armstrong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0035605?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Uncle Garrow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0507207/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gary Lewis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0507207?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hrothgar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001838/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rachel Weisz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0001838?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Saphira"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818648/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Steve Speirs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0818648?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sloan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0576444/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Mehlmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0576444?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Villager #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000460/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeremy Irons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0000460?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Brom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001015/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robert Carlyle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0001015?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Durza"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1330560/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Garrett Hedlund"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm1330560?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Murtagh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0250659/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Christopher Egan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0250659?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Roran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005023/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Djimon Hounsou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0005023?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ajihad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0726490/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Richard Rifkin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm0726490?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Horst"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1510184/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Joss Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0449010/characters/nm1510184?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Angela"}]}]}

It wasn't just the acting, but also the overall look of the film and the music. Mind you, I saw the restored version.\n\nThe film looks exquisite, with stunning sets and truly luscious costumes. A prime example is the ballroom scene. Audrey Hepburn's dresses were also a marvel to look at. This was also helped by the superb cinematography, and the detailed direction, provided by George Cukor. The scene at the racetrack was one of my personal favourite scenes from the film. Oh, and the choreography is fabulous.\n\nThe script is witty and acerbic, with excellent scenes with the social commentary. The story is simple, but is well told, and fits the lengthy running time perfectly.\n\nThe music by Frederick Loewe is just outstanding. Asides from the costumes, the songs are ones that you hear once and never forget. Songs like I Could Have danced All Night, With a Little bit of Luck, Just You wait, Why Can't A Woman Be More Like A Man? and Wouldn't it be Loverly linger long into the memory, and are a joy to the ear. I loved the incidental music at the beginning, then again I am the sort of person who is raised on classical music, and appreciates music for what it is.\n\nThe performances also added a lot to the film; Rex Harrison was just superb as the cynical, misanthropic Professor Henry Higgins, who transforms Eliza Doolittle to the woman she is at the end of the film. The Belgian actress Audrey Hepburn is perfectly enchanting as Eliza, and Marnie Nixon provides her singing voice beautifully.(yes she was dubbed, and Audrey Hepburn is not a slut) There is solid support from Stanley Holloway and Gladys Cooper, and watch out for Sherlock Holmes actor Jeremy Brett as Freddy.\n\nIn conclusion, a truly beautiful film, that deserved all the praise it got, it is an amazing film, that is misunderstood. It is also a perfect treat for around Easter time. Honestly, for those who think it is the worst movie ever made, see something like Home Alone 4, the only film I can think of that deserves a minus rating, that's how terrible that film is. My Fair Lady gets a 10/10 from me, Bethany Cox.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "My Fair Lady", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3277783577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNiNTQxNmYtNDczYS00ZDU5LTliYTEtYTVhNTIxOTEwOWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNiNTQxNmYtNDczYS00ZDU5LTliYTEtYTVhNTIxOTEwOWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Eliza sings The Rain in Spain", "uploadDate": "2009-10-09T13:08:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000030/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Audrey Hepburn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058385/characters/nm0000030?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eliza Doolittle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0391361/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stanley Holloway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058385/characters/nm0391361?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alfred P.

Nia Vardalos stars as a Greek woman who just seems a bit out-of-place in her not always normal life. She is shy, reserved and ashamed of her heritage. Some makeup, a few college classes, stylish clothes and a travel agency job away from her father's restaurant are just the tickets to help her come out of her shell. Soon high school teacher John Corbett is entranced by her and they start a sweet love affair. Naturally she keeps the secret from her parents (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan) and the sparks fly when they eventually find out. They want their daughter to marry a Greek man and have lots of children, but Vardalos has other plans for her life. Corbett's love knows no bounds though as he makes it clear that she is the one he really wants. \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" happened due to good timing and lots of luck. Vardalos was struggling when Tom Hanks' wife (Rita Wilson) went to see the small play that the film is based upon. Wilson happened to see an advertisement for the show in the newspaper one day (the only day Vardalos could afford to run an ad) and the rest as they say is history. The film cost very little to make and usually second-rate director Joel Zwick ended up running the show. Vardalos' screenplay (Oscar-nominated) was the catalyst that put the film on the map and kept it there permanently. Most all the extras are real family members of Vardalos and Ian Gomez (who plays Corbett's best friend) is actually her husband in real life. Easily one of the most successful films of all time financially speaking (based upon the bargain basement cost and the astronomical showing at the box office), \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" is a wholesome film that the whole family can enjoy. It is another one of those rare films that feel like it was made during Hollywood's Golden Age of the 1940s. Not quite excellent, but dangerously close. 4.5 out of 5 stars."}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "My Big Fat Greek Wedding", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3014459673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGE2NTgwN2YtMzJlMi00ZTc4LWI5MDEtMGRmMTA2NTQwODcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGE2NTgwN2YtMzJlMi00ZTc4LWI5MDEtMGRmMTA2NTQwODcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:27:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0889522/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nia Vardalos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0889522?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Toula Portokalos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1164392/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christina Eleusiniotis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm1164392?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Toula Portokalos - Age 6"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0435503/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Kalangis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0435503?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Greek Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1168646/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Marita Zouravlioff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm1168646?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Toula Portokalos - Age 12"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0928667/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Petra Wildgoose"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0928667?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Car Pool Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0577062/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bess Meisler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0577062?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Yiayia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0541909/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Louis Mandylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0541909?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nick Portokalos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0517770/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stavroula Logothettis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0517770?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Athena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176073/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Constantine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0176073?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gus Portokalos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1168304/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kaylee Vieira"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm1168304?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Schoolgirl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0443577/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lainie Kazan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0443577?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maria Portokalos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0652069/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sarah Osman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0652069?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Athena Portokalos - Age 15"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1170097/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Melissa Todd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm1170097?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Car Pool Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0551908/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Andrea Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0551908?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Aunt Voula"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0579102/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Gerry Mendicino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0259446/characters/nm0579102?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Uncle Taki"}]}]}

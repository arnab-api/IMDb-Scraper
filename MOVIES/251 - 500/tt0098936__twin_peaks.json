A teenage girl (Sheryl Lee) is murdered. A strange police detective (Kyle MacLachlan) is brought in to solve the mystery as the local police just cannot cope with the crime. Strange situations continue to pop up all over the landscape of the titled Pacific Northwestern town though and it becomes sadly apparent that the crime will likely never be solved. Side-stories galore confuse and intrigue and the viewer is left wondering, \"Does this have anything to do with the initial crime?\". Then just when you think the puzzle is about solved, total chaos strikes with whacked dream sequences that make you question your own sanity. What is really happening in the town and do we really want to know or are we happier letting the mystery suck us in? \"Twin Peaks\" was created by David Lynch (arguably the finest American film-maker, along with Martin Scorsese, living today) and over two very abbreviated seasons (only 29 total episodes) television reached an age that may never be experienced again. At the time many (perhaps myself included) did not know what to make of the show and even more panned it completely. The fact that the series did not really end the way it should have is sad, but in another way it just adds to the legends and myths involved here. There were eight writers on this series and a mind-blowing 15 different directors (Lynch did some of the work and even Diane Keaton got an opportunity to add to the program). Performers like Ray Wise, Piper Laurie, Joan Chen, Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, Russ Tamblyn and Madchen Amick appear, disappear and re-appear so frequently that you become confused as to what their roles in the show truly are. Monumental, gigantic, legendary, interesting, dominant and definitely thought-provoking, \"Twin Peaks\" is one of those television shows that amazes and dazzles with its highly unique brand of commentary. Followed by a theatrical movie (\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\") in 1992 that was made to answer the questions presented throughout the program, it was also sadly misunderstood by most in the viewing public (even being rubbished by some who loved the series). A real gem in the history of television art. 5 stars out of 5."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Twin Peaks:The First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1140392217", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNhOGQxNTQtNmU0Zi00MjkxLWI4NzAtNWUzYzIwZmRkNzBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNhOGQxNTQtNmU0Zi00MjkxLWI4NzAtNWUzYzIwZmRkNzBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Artisan", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:08:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001492/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kyle MacLachlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0001492?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Special Agent Dale Cooper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000749/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "M\u00e4dchen Amick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0000749?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Shelly Johnson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000937/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richard Beymer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0000937?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Benjamin Horne"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000145/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sherilyn Fenn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0000145?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Audrey Horne"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005152/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Peggy Lipton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0005152?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Norma Jennings"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569239/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Everett McGill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0569239?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Big Ed Hurley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001040/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Joan Chen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0001040?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jocelyn Packard"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0395398/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Horse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0395398?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Deputy Tommy 'Hawk' Hill"}, {"url": "#", "name": "27 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0323556/?ref_=tt_cl_t17", "name": "Harry Goaz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0323556?ref_=tt_cl_t17", "name": "Deputy Andy Brennan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0732133/?ref_=tt_cl_t19", "name": "Wendy Robie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0732133?ref_=tt_cl_t19", "name": "Nadine Hurley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0498247/?ref_=tt_cl_t21", "name": "Sheryl Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098936/characters/nm0498247?ref_=tt_cl_t21", "name": "Maddy Ferguson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "18 episodes, 1989-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0204493/?ref_=tt_cl_t23", "name": "Don S.

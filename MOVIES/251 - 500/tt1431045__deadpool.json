After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.\n\nDeadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.\n\nOne of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.\n\nAs for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.\n\nSitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!\n\n\"Deadpool\" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Even-More-Voiced-Over Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi567457049", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0Nzk0NzAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1Njg5NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0Nzk0NzAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1Njg5NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A groundbreaking 4th wall breaking trailer breakdown of a character who breaks the 4th wall, including extra voice-over on a trailer that includes a voice-over. 8 walls + 4 breaks + 2 voice overs = 1 game-changing superhero.", "uploadDate": "2016-02-11T12:38:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005351/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1431045/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Wade"}, {"url": "/title/tt1431045/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Deadpool"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4534098/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ed Skrein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1431045/characters/nm4534098?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ajax"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1292973/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stefan Kapicic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1431045/characters/nm1292973?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Colossus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4406623/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Style Dayne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1431045/characters/nm4406623?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jeremy (Pizza Guy)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6883785/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Taylor Hickson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1431045/characters/nm6883785?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Meghan Orlovsky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5327351/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Naika Toussaint"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1431045/characters/nm5327351?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Teen Girl #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2554352/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "T.J.

The combination of modern music to medieval setting should be awful, but no, it works! The costumes are totally wrong for the period (on purpose I'd hazard to guess - at one point Angelina Jolie lookalike Shannyn Sossamon is wearing a hat & dress outfit that looks startlingly similar to a costume Julia Roberts wore in Pretty Woman...) but it works! Heath Ledger is an Aussie (what happened to the black hair he had in 10 Things I Hate About You! I didn't recognize him!) and Alan Tudyk is a Texan, so their accents should have tanked! But they didn't, just a few slippages a la Mel Gibson in Braveheart or Jonny Lee Miller in Hackers...\n\nThis film is funny, fast-paced (certainly didn't *feel* over 2h...), well constructed, hilariously tongue-in-cheek (From the We Will Rock You opening scene to the Nike swooshes on the armor I couldn't stop laughing!) It certainly has its problems (including some *horribly* cheezy lines - most on purpose but that doesn't make them any less horrible! and an evil Hollywood ending - including a Bravheart-like scream of defiance in the final joust that made me cringe...) but those problems are overcome by sharp wit and consistent amusement. The actors were obviously enjoying themselves, and the action was beautifully blended in with the rest of the film. None of the jousting scenes were too long (like, say, the race in Phantom Menace...) and all were shot in such a way as to make them really exciting!\n\nAnd I have to laud Paul Bettany who was an incredible and incredibly amusing Geoffrey Chaucer...even though he looks eerily similar, IMO, to Thom Yorke...)\n\nKudos to anyone who recognizes Laura Fraser (the blacksmith) from Man in the Iron Mask...\n\nOverall: A great watch. I went in expecting little and came out extremely satisfied. Not the best film of its kind, but a head above most. And the blending of contemporary style and music and characterization with the medieval story/setting is really well done. It really shouldn't but it does work! 7/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H12M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "A Knight's Tale", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2427715865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkxMzRmODYtOTRmMy00ZjQwLTk4MjAtNDQ5YjQ2NTZjZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkxMzRmODYtOTRmMy00ZjQwLTk4MjAtNDQ5YjQ2NTZjZDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T06:13:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005132/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Heath Ledger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0005132?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William Thatcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0815370/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Shannyn Sossamon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0815370?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jocelyn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0292182/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Laura Fraser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0292182?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0876138/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alan Tudyk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0876138?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Wat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0359710/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Scott Handy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0359710?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Germaine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176808/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Leagh Conwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0176808?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Young William Thatcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640838/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Steven O'Donnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0640838?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Simon the Summoner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003818/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nick Brimble"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0003818?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sir Ector"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001722/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rufus Sewell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0001722?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Count Adhemar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0079273/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Paul Bettany"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0079273?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Geoffrey Chaucer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004692/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mark Addy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0004692?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Roland"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0067367/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0067367?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Christiana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0700856/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "James Purefoy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0700856?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Colville"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0147392/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Christopher Cazenove"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0147392?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Thatcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0805872/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jonathan Slinger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0183790/characters/nm0805872?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter the Pardoner"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "French", "Latin"], "Release Date": ["11 May 2001 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["A Knight's Tale"], "Filming Locations": ["Barrandov Studios, Prague, Czech Republic"], "Budget": ["$65,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$16,511,391,", "13 May 2001"], "Gross USA": ["$56,569,702"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$117,487,473"], "Production Co": ["Columbia Pictures", "Escape Artists", "Finestkind"], "Runtime": ["132 min", "144 min", "(extended)"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital", "SDDS", "(8 channels)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

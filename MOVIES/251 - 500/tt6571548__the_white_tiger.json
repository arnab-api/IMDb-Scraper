I know India has huge issues with poverty and class systems, but is this really how it is? I'm not complaining. But I also don't want to pigeon-hole the country based on this movies portrayal.\n\nIt's a harsh film highlighting the desperate plight of just one man among the MILLIONS of poor and starving in India and his desire to ascend... no matter the cost.\n\nThe film followed the path of the book almost flawlessly.\n\nThe story of Balram is definitley rags to riches. But it is certainly not \"feel good\" or glamorous. India is portrayed as a brutal country and if you are not wealthy or politically wired, you're existance is simply reduced to a waiting game with death as the end result.\n\nTo sum it up in one phrase, this movie could be tagged; \"Dog eat dog.\" Other reviewers expressed their disgust at the protagonists methods for success. But I also bet they've never been poor, let alone poor in India.\n\nYou can discuss ethics and morality from the comfort of your lounge room/home theatre all you want. It means nothing if you've never walked a mile in these people's shoes (and most don't even have those).\n\nIt's not for everyone. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film. But it is certainly confronting.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3440689433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ3ZmNjNTYtNDI0Yy00ZTFhLWFmNDUtN2E5OTlkY2VjNmI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ3ZmNjNTYtNDI0Yy00ZTFhLWFmNDUtN2E5OTlkY2VjNmI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "The ambitious driver (Adarsh Gourav) of a rich Indian couple (Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Rajkummar Rao) uses his wit and cunning to escape from poverty and become an entrepreneur.

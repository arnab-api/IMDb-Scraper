A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment.  I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced.  I should see this movie.  I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD.  I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again.  And again.  And again.\n\nThis movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic.  I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away.  Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).\n\nNorton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life.  He needs something to change his life.  Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away.  Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching.  As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away.  One of the best movie endings I've seen.  Even better if you're a Pixies fan.\n\nAs for it being important, don't worry.  You will be hearing about this movie.  When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic.  These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books.  If you haven't read either, get to it.  Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequenceless violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.\n\nWatch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends.  10 out of 10."}, "duration": "PT2H19M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fight Club", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi781228825", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNmYzllNWYtYzU1Yi00YWFmLTgwMzMtZmY4OGE3NzExNzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNmYzllNWYtYzU1Yi00YWFmLTgwMzMtZmY4OGE3NzExNzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Fight Club", "uploadDate": "2011-01-01T06:12:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001570/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Edward Norton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0001570?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "The Narrator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001533/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Meat Loaf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0001533?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert 'Bob' Paulsen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0037118/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richmond Arquette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0037118?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Intern"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0536574/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "George Maguire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0536574?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Group Leader"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000307/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Helena Bonham Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0000307?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marla Singer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0173257/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sydney 'Big Dawg' Colston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0173257?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Speaker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0188728/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Christie Cronenweth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0188728?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Airline Attendant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0125653/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ezra Buzzington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0125653?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Inspector Dent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000093/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Brad Pitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0000093?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tyler Durden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0340260/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Zach Grenier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0340260?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard Chesler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0028625/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0028625?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Thomas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0094163/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eugenie Bondurant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0094163?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Weeping Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0127680/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Christina Cabot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0127680?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Group Leader"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0802019/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rachel Singer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0802019?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Chloe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212498/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tim DeZarn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0212498?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Inspector Bird"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Germany", "USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["15 October 1999 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Fight Club"], "Filming Locations": ["421 W.

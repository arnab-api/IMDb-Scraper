All these moments will be lost in time like tears in rain.\" Hauer puts all the things that are so amazing about people: sense of poetry, sense of humor, sense of sexuality, sense of the kid, sense of soul\u0085 \n\nScott brought out the best qualities in his performers\u0085 He coaxed and very gently manipulated performances from his actors that in some instances I think they've rarely topped\u0085 You feel the story, you feel the emotions of the characters and you will be lost in the middle of this wild world, you know, it's so rich and it's painful\u0085 I mean it's a very bluesy, dark story and told very compassionately\u0085 \n\nThe overpopulation, the sort of crowd scenes is so rich and varied and there's such an extreme detail designing the magazine covers, designing the look of the punks, the Hare Krishnas, the biological salesman, everything is designed\u0085 You have just Piccadilly Circus punks walking by\u0085 You have a sense of layers in that society\u0085 That is one of those things that you see again and again\u0085 The city landscape with the big billboards \u00e0 la Kyoto or Tokyo\u0085 Scott was able to create the look based on what goes on in various cities all over the world\u0085 Whether it is Tokyo, Kyoto or Beijing or Hong Kong or whatever, you're right in \"Blade Runner\" country\u0085 \n\n\"Blade Runner,\" to me, embodies the elegance, the power, and the uniqueness of a film experience\u0085 It's the most classical, beautiful, purest movie-making writing and then the film-making itself is\u0085 The images and the sound and the music, it's pure cinema\u0085 Ridley came out with an amazing, brilliantly executed future of an absolute dystopia\u0085 The intensity of his perfectionism on \"Blade Runner\" made the movie\u0085 This is a master at his best", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Blade Runner", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi531759385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwOTM1Mjk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwOTM1Mjk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Blade Runner Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-11-27T09:22:44Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000148/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harrison Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083658/characters/nm0000148?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rick Deckard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000707/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sean Young"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083658/characters/nm0000707?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rachael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001826/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "M.

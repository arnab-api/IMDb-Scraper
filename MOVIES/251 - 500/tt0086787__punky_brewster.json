I've seen each and every one of the episodes.  I loved how she always wore very colorful clothes(and different shoes by the way), that funky bed that leaned over when she got on it, her very colorful room(along with the colorful window and shade),her dog, her friends, her treehouse, and the way she brightened up the room when she walked in.  My favorite episode was the 5 parter when Henry has a heart attack and Punky has to go to \"Fenster Hall\" until Henry can get back on her feet.  Little did they know Punky was going to be adopted by a rich snobby couple. I wish they would put the re-runs on family channel so I can record them and cherish them for the rest of my life."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3830497561", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQyNDAwNmYtZjU5OS00MzhjLTkzZTctMTE0NjBmNTkwYTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQyNDAwNmYtZjU5OS00MzhjLTkzZTctMTE0NjBmNTkwYTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In this continuation of the iconic 80s sitcom about a bright young girl raised by a foster dad, Punky is now a single mother of three trying to get her life back on track when she meets Izzy, a young girl in the foster system who reminds Punky a lot of her younger self.", "uploadDate": "2021-02-02T19:35:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0310960/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Gaynes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086787/characters/nm0310960?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Henry Warnimont"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 1984-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1940545/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sandy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086787/characters/nm1940545?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brandon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "44 episodes, 1984-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308215/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Susie Garrett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086787/characters/nm0308215?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Johnson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "85 episodes, 1984-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004941/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Soleil Moon Frye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086787/characters/nm0004941?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Penelope 'Punky' Brewster"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 1984-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424762/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cherie Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086787/characters/nm0424762?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cherie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "86 episodes, 1984-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0287676/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ami Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086787/characters/nm0287676?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Margaux"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 1984-1988"}]}], "details": {"Release Date": ["16 September 1984 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Punky Brewster"], "Filming Locations": ["Chicago, Illinois, USA"], "Production Co": ["Coca-Cola Telecommunications", "Lightkeeper Productions", "NBC Productions"], "Runtime": ["30 min", "(88 episodes)"]}}

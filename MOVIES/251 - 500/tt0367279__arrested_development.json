It's very hard to describe, since the comedy is entirely character-based, not plot- or wisecrack-based.\n\nBasically, it's the story of the Bluth family, developers who are in bankruptcy with the father in prison for fraud.  One son, Michael, tries to be responsible and keep things going, while the rest of the group is entirely self-centered and can't seem to focus on the fact they are broke and in disgrace.\n\nThe various family members go off in various directions:  George (GOB) fancies himself a magician, Buster is a momma's boy, Lindsay goes off supporting odd causes, Lindsay's husband Tobias fancies himself an actor. It's a show you need to watch closely, but the laughs are all over the place, from unexpected directions."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 5 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi692697113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk5NWRjZDYtNGNmNy00YzI5LTg1ODEtNzRjZTA1MTU1Y2U4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTk5NWRjZDYtNGNmNy00YzI5LTg1ODEtNzRjZTA1MTU1Y2U4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In the aftermath of Cinco de Quatro, the Bluth family are all facing one question, that no one quite has the answer to: Where is Lucille Two?

I am in recovery. Sober for 20 years now. Everyday I am very grateful that I survived. I don't take my life for granted anymore. So when I herd about this show I had to watch. As soon as I was done was episode 1 I was the shows #1 fan.\n\nNow that the show has ended its fourth season I am happy to say \"I am still it's #1 fan\". I love the fact that the show takes many chances (Some chances work some don't). I love the fact that the people in recovery are shown as human and that they still make mistakes and \"life is still life\". \n\nThe shows first season was a little \"hit and miss\". The producers were trying to figure out what was working and what wasn't. \n\nWhat was not working on the show was Christy's work life and dating life. Her friends (and mother) in recovery was comic gold. \n\nIn season 2 they added Jaime Pressly, Mimi Kennedy & Beth Hall. When all these women are together in one scene is when the show shines its brightest. \n\nAgain the show is not perfect but it least it takes more chances than most television shows. It is very funny and dare I say \"Very Real\". \n\nTo everyone that works on the show I just want to say \"Bravo\".", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "First Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1090889241", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMwMTAxMzkxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQwODI1OQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMwMTAxMzkxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQwODI1OQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the first trailer for the CBS series \"Mom.\"", "uploadDate": "2013-05-17T10:03:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005049/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Allison Janney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2660806/characters/nm0005049?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bonnie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "169 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0448252/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mimi Kennedy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2660806/characters/nm0448252?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marjorie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "148 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005326/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jaime Pressly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2660806/characters/nm0005326?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jill"}, {"url": "#", "name": "126 episodes, 2014-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267506/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Anna Faris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2660806/characters/nm0267506?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "152 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1305105/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Beth Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2660806/characters/nm1305105?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wendy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "127 episodes, 2014-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001209/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "William Fichtner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2660806/characters/nm0001209?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Adam"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 2016-2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["23 September 2013 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Mom"], "Filming Locations": ["Stage 20, Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Chuck Lorre Productions", "Warner Bros.

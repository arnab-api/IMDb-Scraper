The devastation I felt when Morse went, then Poirot, then finally Foyle's War was pretty big, three of the best shows from the last twenty years in my opinion, but Endeavour has taken the mantle.\n\nMorse had a unique quality, different to all others, I truly feel that all those behind Endeavour have managed to capture that DNA and bring it to life. Shaun Evans is magical in the role, as the show goes on I feel that he's really managed o capture the essence of John Thaw, he'd have been proud. Roger Allam was the perfect actor to cast as Thursday, he is consistently superb, a joy to watch. I also love the fact that Abigail Thaw was given a recurring role, respectful. That also extends to the appearances of Colin Dexter, until his death in 2017.\n\nThe Morse series was so rich in detail that Endeavour could well run for several years, the content is so deliciously high in quality that there's plenty to draw from.\n\nSo many brilliant episodes, favourites of mine include Quartet, Icarus and Neverland, but how do you chose? \n\nPlease let this run for many years, viewing at its best. 10/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 4 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2451094041", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTllNGRlMzctYjE2Yy00NDc4LTk5MzYtYmVmMzYwZjAwY2M4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "\"Endeavour\" returns for a Season 4.", "uploadDate": "2019-01-15T19:29:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1140345/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Shaun Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm1140345?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "DC Endeavour Morse"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103495/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Bradshaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm0103495?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Max DeBryn"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0504320/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anton Lesser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm0504320?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chief Superintendent Reginald Bright"}, {"url": "#", "name": "29 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0857173/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Abigail Thaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm0857173?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dorothea Frazil"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2301950/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dakota Blue Richards"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm2301950?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "WPC Shirley Trewlove"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0019885/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Roger Allam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm0019885?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "DI Fred Thursday"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5607429/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sean Rigby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm5607429?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "DS Jim Strange"}, {"url": "#", "name": "29 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642109/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Caroline O'Neill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm0642109?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Win Thursday"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2335154/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sara Vickers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2701582/characters/nm2335154?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joan Thursday"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2013-2019"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["1 July 2012 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Endeavour"], "Production Co": ["Mammoth Screen", "Masterpiece", "ITV Studios"], "Runtime": ["89 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

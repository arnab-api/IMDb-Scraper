Simple, yet top notch with a Canadian like atmosphere.Very realistic for the times. History is great. The clothing designs and artifacts is exceptional. It seems the times were simple back then. Well written with a touch of humour. The cast are all excellent. You can tell they all get along really well. The show reminds me of Sherlock Holmes and yet it also reminds me of Sue Thomas FB Eye and Due South which by the way it sure was nice to see Paul Gross (from Due South) appear in an episode as his brother, although not sure what episode it was. We didn't see his name on the cast list as a guest star. The guest appearances are outstanding and it sure is nice to see some familiar faces. We love and watch all the episodes. With each season the character story lines change as in the case of Helen Joy, Yannick Bisson which is excellent leaving us more curious with what will happen next. That is one of the reasons we like the show. Now that the show is in it's fourth year the plot lines are continually changing which goes to prove that Murdoch Mysteries is a true success. Keep up the excellent work.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2131996697", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwY2Y4ZGMtOTlmNi00ZDA4LTg5MGMtM2NjN2E0YTY3ZTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Murdoch Mysteries: Season 8", "uploadDate": "2015-06-14T04:40:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0084370/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Yannick Bisson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091909/characters/nm0084370?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Detective William Murdoch"}, {"url": "#", "name": "218 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186030/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thomas Craig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091909/characters/nm0186030?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Inspector Thomas Brackenreid"}, {"url": "#", "name": "218 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0613763/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lachlan Murdoch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091909/characters/nm0613763?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Constable Henry Higgins"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0431420/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Helene Joy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091909/characters/nm0431420?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Julia Ogden"}, {"url": "#", "name": "218 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1649782/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jonny Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091909/characters/nm1649782?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Constable George Crabtree"}, {"url": "#", "name": "218 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Canada", "UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["24 January 2008 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Artful Detective"], "Filming Locations": ["Westfield Heritage Village, Rockton, Ontario, Canada"], "Production Co": ["Shaftesbury Films", "ITV Studios Global Entertainment", "UKTV"], "Runtime": ["48 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "(Stereo)", "Dolby Digital", "(Dolby 2.0)", "DTS", "(DTS 2.0)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16 : 9"]}}

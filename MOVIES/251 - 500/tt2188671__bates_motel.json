I prefer films. Ended stories. However I could not resist watching the first episode of this idea of a nowadays prequel which is to explain how Norman Bates could become like he did in the classic Hitchcock movie Psycho. A strange, but still kind of compelling idea.\n\nAnd from the start I was really drawn into the story, due to Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore. They play so well, that is starts twisting your mind. Freddie Highmore is such a perfect cast. Or rather, he's such a talented young actor. He's been studying the body language of Anthony Perkins character in the classic film. It's literally like seeing the young Norman. And in a strange way, Vera Farmiga is just like how we would see tough mother afraid of losing grip of her last piece of family, her beloved son.\n\nIt's also great to see the house on the hill and the Bates Motel to good usage again, as it still is standing like it was back in 1960. Maybe the most iconic film featured house in the history of film. I started enjoying it because of the acting, and will have to see more of this, building up the interest of seeing Psycho amongst the younger generation, and getting to lean about the grand master of suspense, Sir Alfred Hitchcock.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 4 Trailer - \"Dangerous\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi571651353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU1MzY5NTQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NDMyODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU1MzY5NTQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NDMyODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 4 trailer for Bates Motel on A&E.", "uploadDate": "2016-03-05T15:49:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267812/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vera Farmiga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2188671/characters/nm0267812?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Norma Louise Bates"}, {"url": "#", "name": "50 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1302735/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Max Thieriot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2188671/characters/nm1302735?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dylan Massett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "50 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004801/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nestor Carbonell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2188671/characters/nm0004801?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sheriff Alex Romero"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383603/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Freddie Highmore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2188671/characters/nm0383603?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Norman Bates"}, {"url": "#", "name": "50 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4972453/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Olivia Cooke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2188671/characters/nm4972453?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Emma Decody"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["18 March 2013 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Bates Motel"], "Filming Locations": ["Aldergrove, British Columbia, Canada"], "Budget": ["$10,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Production Co": ["American Genre Film Archive", "Kerry Ehrin Productions", "Universal Television"], "Runtime": ["45 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

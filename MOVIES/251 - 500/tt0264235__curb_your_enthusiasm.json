To compare \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" to \"Seinfeld\" is preposterous. With \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", Larry David has created one of the greatest comedic series one have ever seen on American television. Fortunately for us, we got hooked right away from his first year and we sadly miss a new installment, which we thought would be forthcoming in the 2004-2005 season.\n\nMost of the episodes have been directed by Robert Weide, who seems to be attuned to Mr. David's kind of comedy. The episodes directed by the other guest directors are fine as well, but it seems that Mr. Weide gets the best out of all performers in the ones he is at the helm.\n\nThe cast is flawless. Larry David is always enjoyable playing himself, something that is no small accomplishment. He is just a natural. Cheryl Hinds plays Larry's wife with a lot of style. Jeff Garlin, as Larry's manager, is good. Many talented performers are seen in different episodes among them, Sisie Essman, Wanda Sykes, Richard Lewis, and Ted Danson.\n\n\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has a quality that most other sitcoms don't have and it is the ability to amuse us even in reruns! This happens because of Larry David's tremendous intelligent approach to comedy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 9 | Trailer 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1225636121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVkMTM4NzktYmUxMC00M2E3LWJhNzEtMmE0OWJlMmMyYTQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVkMTM4NzktYmUxMC00M2E3LWJhNzEtMmE0OWJlMmMyYTQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch a trailer for \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" Season 9.", "uploadDate": "2017-09-11T15:51:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0202970/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Larry David"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0264235/characters/nm0202970?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Larry David"}, {"url": "#", "name": "101 episodes, 2000-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0385644/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cheryl Hines"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0264235/characters/nm0385644?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cheryl David"}, {"url": "#", "name": "91 episodes, 2000-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0307531/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeff Garlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0264235/characters/nm0307531?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeff Greene"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2000-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0261435/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Susie Essman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0264235/characters/nm0261435?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Susie Greene"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 2000-2020"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["15 October 2000 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Curb Your Enthusiasm"], "Filming Locations": ["553 Moreno Avenue, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Home Box Office (HBO)", "Production Partners"], "Runtime": ["28 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

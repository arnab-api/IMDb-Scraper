Many people were skeptical about Chris Evans being cast as the man in red, white, and blue mainly because he is previously known for playing Johnny Storm in the not so fantastic Fantastic Four movies. Despite, the fact that he had a lot of pressure going into this film, I thought he did a fare job. I personally don't think this was the best Avengers tie in movie but it was fine. The first half of the movie did a very good job of establishing the story behind the creation of this man and how he was initially just an experiment and then turned into a propaganda piece for the war in order to excite people and inspire them to fight the fight. Afterward, when he finally does take initiative and attempts to infiltrate and destroy the enemy, the movie turns into a pretty standard and generic action movie. Hugo Weaving is cast as the villain known in the comics as the Red Skull. Despite a good looking face (a red face), he never really becomes too menacing and isn't given enough screen time as the red skull to really effect us. Tommy Lee Jones is in his realm as an army commander who is in charge of operations including Rogers and is very funny as well as delivering the lines extremely well. Speaking of lines, this movie doesn't have the best or worst script and I think they (the writers) could have spent more time developing better dialogue that didn't sound so rushed. Director Joe Johnston who is know for The Rocketeer brings the 1940s World War feeling to the screen brilliantly and with great set designers and art direction. Tony Starks father plays a fairly significant role as the man behind the suit and weapons of the Captain. Played by Dominic Cooper, we get an inside look at how Stark got his attitude and knack for building new technology. The 3D added nothing, which is not unusual nowadays. The only time it was ever apparent was when the shield was thrown towards the screen which happened maybe twice. This movie does a nice job of finishing the tie in movie for the upcoming epic Avengers movie die to release next year. My only hope is that all of this build up with the individual super hero movies is not wasted. This is worth a rental and I will probably buy this on blu-ray when the price is greatly reduced."}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Captain America: The First Avenger -- Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2912787481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM2ZjRhMGMtZjM1OC00OTM5LTkxMjQtOTBmYjE4NTI4YTVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM2ZjRhMGMtZjM1OC00OTM5LTkxMjQtOTBmYjE4NTI4YTVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After being deemed unfit for military service, Steve Rogers volunteers for a top secret research project that turns him into Captain America, a superhero dedicated to defending America's ideals.", "uploadDate": "2011-06-25T12:49:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0262635/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458339/characters/nm0262635?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain America"}, {"url": "/title/tt0458339/characters/nm0262635?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Rogers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659221/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sebastian Stan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458339/characters/nm1659221?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915989/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hugo Weaving"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458339/characters/nm0915989?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Johann Schmidt"}, {"url": "/title/tt0458339/characters/nm0915989?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Red Skull"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035514/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Richard Armitage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458339/characters/nm0035514?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Heinz Kruger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000168/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Samuel L.

A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Retaliate", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3047862297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MzkxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQzMTc1NTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MzkxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQzMTc1NTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch a trailer for \"Mad Max.\"", "uploadDate": "2015-05-03T13:11:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0362766/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Hardy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm0362766?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Max Rockatansky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396558/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nicholas Hoult"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm0396558?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nux"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2890541/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Josh Helman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm2890541?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Slit"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2368789/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Zo\u00eb Kravitz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm2368789?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Toast the Knowing"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2142336/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Riley Keough"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm2142336?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Capable"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5196907/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Courtney Eaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm5196907?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cheedo the Fragile"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141885/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Richard Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm0141885?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "The Bullet Farmer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0760151/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Angus Sampson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm0760151?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "The Organic Mechanic"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000234/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Charlize Theron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm0000234?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Imperator Furiosa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0117412/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hugh Keays-Byrne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm0117412?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Immortan Joe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428923/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nathan Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm0428923?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rictus Erectus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2492819/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rosie Huntington-Whiteley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm2492819?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "The Splendid Angharad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3880181/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Abbey Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm3880181?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "The Dag"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397398/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm0397398?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "The People Eater"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5208473/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Iota"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1392190/characters/nm5208473?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "The Doof Warrior"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Australia", "South Africa"], "Language": ["English", "Russian"], "Release Date": ["15 May 2015 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Mad Max: Fury Road"], "Filming Locations": ["Namib Desert, Namibia"], "Budget": ["$150,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$45,428,128,", "17 May 2015"], "Gross USA": ["$154,058,340"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$376,109,824"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Village Roadshow Pictures", "Kennedy Miller Productions"], "Runtime": ["120 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Datasat", "SDDS", "Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

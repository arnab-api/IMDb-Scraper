Law & Order, as originally conceived, drew the viewer into the process by which American law enforcement and litigation works, or doesn't, depending on the viewer's opinion. The first half-hour is devoted to the investigation of a crime, the second to its prosecution. Cases are made or lost by evidence, lack thereof, a technicality, or even judicial whim. Dick Wolf made it clear from day one that the cast was expendable; no prima donnas here. The first cast was all male, with one African-American. Wolf apparently caved to fan pressure for a more politically-correct spectrum, but it really didn't matter so long as the actors could carry the story forward. His best casting choice was Jerry Orbach, his worst Elisabeth Rohm, but with or without these people, the drama continues. In recent years, L&O has lost some of the grittiness that made it so compelling, and I do miss actors such as Steven Hill, Michael Moriarty, Chris Noth, Jill Hennessy and now Orbach, but the show is still far superior to the majority of what passes for prime-time programming. It only suffers in the rare episodes when a politically-correct message is pushed into the story, i.e., whenever it deviates from its original format of presenting how the criminal justice system works. Ignore the spinoffs; the original Law & Order is still the best."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Law & Order: The Eighth Year", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3794972441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0OGJhMjMtNTFjZi00ZWViLWFlOWMtMmJhZjY4MmUzNTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0OGJhMjMtNTFjZi00ZWViLWFlOWMtMmJhZjY4MmUzNTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Franchise trailer", "uploadDate": "2014-10-25T04:39:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0580924/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "S.

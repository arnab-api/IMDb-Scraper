Things become worse when a pent-up police officer, Dixon (Sam Rockwell) becomes enraged and starts acting out.\n\nLots of swearing, lots of violence, and lots of laughs to be had in this film. It was strange to watch as I had just seen another film, Past Life, that focused on the subject of anger and pain, and how it can eat a person up and destroy them. This film is yet another good illustration of that, as Mildred stops at nothing to make a point.\n\nThe one-liners are amazing, and Mildred's speech to the priest who comes by to ask her to remove the billboards is hilarious. The movie is filled with strong performances and equally well-developed characters. We see all of their sides - violent, kind, vengeful, angry, sad; we finally realize they're just people driven in some cases to extremes.\n\nHarrelson's performance is touching -- we're prepared to dislike him but his sincerity and humanity come through. As Dixon, Rockwell seems like a monster, but once he acts out, he's able to focus his energy a little better.\n\nAnd then there's McDormand, a powerhouse. She's not good ol' Marge in Fargo. She's a tough woman with a broken heart who takes out her anger any way she can. It's a beautiful, multilayered performance. Highly recommended, asking the questions of where revenge and hatred can take us, and deciding when and if it stops.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Now Playing", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3585980441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxMzJjNDEtNzI3MS00OWFkLTliZjYtYjc3ZTZiMDc2YWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ0MDUyMzg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxMzJjNDEtNzI3MS00OWFkLTliZjYtYjc3ZTZiMDc2YWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQ0MDUyMzg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In this darkly comic drama, a mother personally challenges the local authorities to solve her daughter's murder, when they fail to catch the culprit.", "uploadDate": "2017-11-20T23:46:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000531/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frances McDormand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm0000531?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mildred"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0174403/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kerry Condon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm0174403?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Pamela"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6019128/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alejandro Barrios"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm6019128?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Latino"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2888524/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Darrell Britt-Gibson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm2888524?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jerome"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0180411/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Abbie Cornish"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm0180411?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Anne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9362778/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Selah Atwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm9362778?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411964/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Zeljko Ivanek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm0411964?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Desk Sergeant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1371862/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Malaya Rivera Drew"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm1371862?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gabriella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2655177/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Caleb Landry Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm2655177?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Red Welby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005377/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sam Rockwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm0005377?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dixon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4654982/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jason Ledford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm4654982?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Latino #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Willoughby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9362777/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Riya May Atwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm9362777?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Polly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2348627/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lucas Hedges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm2348627?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robbie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2581729/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Amanda Warren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5027774/characters/nm2581729?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Denise"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK", "USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["1 December 2017 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Three Billboards"], "Filming Locations": ["Asheville, North Carolina, USA"], "Budget": ["$15,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$322,168,", "12 November 2017"], "Gross USA": ["$54,513,740"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$160,192,267"], "Production Co": ["Blueprint Pictures", "Film 4", "Fox Searchlight Pictures"], "Runtime": ["115 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

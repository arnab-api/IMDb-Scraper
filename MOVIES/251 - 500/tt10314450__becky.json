Kevin James executes this extremely played out and cliche Aryan brotherhood/supremacist/convict character as well as he could've with what barren script he was given.\n\nEverything starts out with some solid character development with the young Lulu Wilson with her struggles and current emotional situation. As things progress we fly ahead into the start of the action and are introduced to the ever cliche written group of villains with intensity and mystery. At this point it appears as though they will explain a certain plot device in which the antagonists are after, but they fail to do so. Then things start getting gruesome and very fast paced and you still wonder what they are truly after. Towards the final act just when you think they'll explain what the point of all this was, we are once again left hanging without any true explanation of their intentions with the main object they were after rendering the whole story nearly useless other than for extreme brutality and revenge empowerment.\n\nAs I mentioned the film has some decently entertaining performances by James and Wilson, and some solid production value, but there is almost no story here. If they would've simply given an explanation to the motives of these convicts and wrapped up some loose ends, it could've been slightly better. Instead it just feels like a hollow and cliche revenge thriller.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1658306073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJhNmUxODYtYTM3Yy00YTYzLTljMDUtNjNhY2U3Njc2MDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJhNmUxODYtYTM3Yy00YTYzLTljMDUtNjNhY2U3Njc2MDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "Spunky and rebellious, Becky (Lulu Wilson) is brought to a weekend getaway at a lake house by her father Jeff (Joel McHale) in an effort to try to reconnect.

And this is a very important thing to teach, something we really do not see enough of.\n\nThis movie I cannot get out of my mind and I believe it is for the fact that Jack O'Connell is clearly a master of acting and he is speaking for someone who has no voice of their own: it is gut-wrenchingly powerful. Never before have I seen an actor so devoted to portraying the underdog who is really forced to come to understanding of a terrible fate.\n\nThese types of movies are valid because they give you not just the story but the feeling. The feeling of being lost and forgotten, yet heard by someone. I don't care who you are, deep down everyone should be able to relate to that: being unheard by the masses but remembered by few. It's literally one of the only things we can strive for.\n\nI probably won't be able to change your mind about whether or not you want to sit through (**another**) relentless prison movie where hope can only come through as passive understanding. And I won't say that this movie is for everyone but if you are curious about some of the major inequalities (and I say major because instead of reform we are just erasing these people from society) that plague or beautiful and modern world and you can stomach a little short of 2 hours of intense character development in an setting where development isnt just unencouraged but definitely unwanted then you need to check out this movie. Just remember though that the hope is still out there.\n\nAnd I just want to end by saying \"thank you\" to Jack O'Connell. Your efforts to bring awareness to these causes is greatly appreciated not just by me but by many. And I know he would never read this but i just want to add that his depictions of struggles through insane situations has increased the desire in me to enact change as well, and that is what art is all about. So a huge applause to him for taking on the roles that must be near impossible to shake off at nite.\n\nAnd if you enjoy this definitely check him out in Starred Up and Unbroken, then tell everyone you know about these injustices because that is the only way we will ever change as a society.\n\nThanks for reading.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H7M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trial by Fire Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1255783705", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQ3YmE4NjQtNDgxNS00Mzk1LWE2NjAtMDQwZTAzYTE5MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQ3YmE4NjQtNDgxNS00Mzk1LWE2NjAtMDQwZTAzYTE5MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg", "description": "'Trial by Fire' stars Laura Dern and Jack O'Connell.", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T16:13:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1925239/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack O'Connell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm1925239?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Todd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2007030/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Emily Meade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm2007030?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stacy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0675114/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jeff Perry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm0675114?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hurst"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1477818/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "David Wilson Barnes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm1477818?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Reaves"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6351666/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Blake Scott Lewis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm6351666?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Johnny Webb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3470683/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Noah Lomax"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm3470683?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Andrew"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0326988/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Carlos G\u00f3mez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm0326988?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Vasquez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0565752/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Katie McClellan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm0565752?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Margaret"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000368/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laura Dern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm0000368?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Elizabeth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2421211/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chris Coy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm2421211?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Daniels"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4163356/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "McKinley Belcher III"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm4163356?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ponchai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1496294/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Darren Pettie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm1496294?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Horton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3167464/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jade Pettyjohn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm3167464?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Julie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235103/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jason Douglas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm0235103?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jackson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0721593/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Anthony Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3263946/characters/nm0721593?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Fogg"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["17 May 2019 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Trial by Fire"], "Filming Locations": ["Atlanta, Georgia, USA"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$78,817,", "19 May 2019"], "Gross USA": ["$148,504"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$148,504"], "Production Co": ["Flashlight Films", "The Bedford Falls Company", "The Domain Group"], "Runtime": ["127 min"]}}

Vinterberg takes a naturalistic & humanistic approach to bring his story to life and offers a fascinating take on the role of alcohol in Danish culture (or any culture for that matter). The plot concerns four friends who test out an alcohol experiment to enliven their banal professional & personal lives, and it is compelling throughout.\n\nBut none of it would be as gripping if the bonding between the characters wasn't convincing enough and their individual arcs weren't fleshed out. Everyone plays a valuable role in the story yet the one who makes the experience truly worthwhile & rewarding is Mads Mikkelsen whose performance here ranks amongst his finest. We strongly relate to his character, are fully invested in his journey, and the magic he conjures in the last segment is destined to leave an indelible impression on the viewers, leaving them all high & in a state of pure bliss.\n\nOverall, Another Round is beautifully anchored by Vinterberg's sensible direction & Mikkelsen's masterful rendition, and is one of the most engrossing, arresting & life-affirming films of the year. Equal parts funny, touching & heartbreaking, this Danish dramedy has enough vigour & potency to leave most viewers enraptured with its infectious spell & fleeting vibe, and the dazzling quality of the last scene not only serves as a fitting end to a joyful ride but also affirms the film's position as one of the strongest entries of 2020. Truly worth your time & money, Another Round comes highly recommended."}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4070162713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4NGY3ZWEtMWYyMy00MzY4LWFlNzktYjdmMGFjYTIxNGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4NGY3ZWEtMWYyMy00MzY4LWFlNzktYjdmMGFjYTIxNGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Four friends, all high school teachers, test a theory that they will improve their lives by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-30T13:42:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0586568/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mads Mikkelsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm0586568?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2099237/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Magnus Millang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm2099237?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nikolaj"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0095013/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Maria Bonnevie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm0095013?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anika"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0937622/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Susse Wold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm0937622?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rektor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11070573/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Silas Cornelius Van"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm11070573?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kasper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1563441/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Martin Greis-Rosenthal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm1563441?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Overtjener"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11429689/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Aksel Vedsegaard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm11429689?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11429691/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gustav Sigurth Jeppesen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm11429691?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rasmus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0488917/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Thomas Bo Larsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm0488917?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1046521/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lars Ranthe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm1046521?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Peter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2530407/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Helene Reingaard Neumann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm2530407?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Amalie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6943136/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Magnus Sj\u00f8rup"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm6943136?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jonas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4851077/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Albert Rudbeck Lindhardt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm4851077?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sebastian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4829003/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Frederik Winther Rasmussen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm4829003?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Malthe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11429690/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Aya Grann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10288566/characters/nm11429690?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Josephine"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Denmark", "Sweden", "Netherlands"], "Language": ["Danish", "Swedish"], "Release Date": ["18 December 2020 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Another Round"], "Filming Locations": ["Aureh\u00f8j Gymnasium, Gentofte, Denmark"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$4,198,431"], "Production Co": ["Zentropa Entertainments", "Film i V\u00e4st", "Zentropa International Sweden"], "Runtime": ["117 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.00 : 1"]}}

This Film's -Completely- Bonkers\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca3 BUT ..I'm { Still } Not -Completely- Certain What To Quite Make Of It\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude36...", "reviewBody": "\n* Harley Quinn { to Cassandra Cain at the supermarket } : \" There's two ways we're getting that diamond out of you ; this.... \"\n* ( ..Shows her laxative ) .\n* Harley Quinn : \" ...or this... \"\n* ( ..Shows her a carving knife ) .\n{ Cassandra very \" Wisely \" chooses the laxative } .\n\n OK, so first , a couple of the ->- { ' Plusses ' } ->- in Random Order . Let me start by saying that this film has an Absolute \" Killer \ud83d\ude09\u2755\" Soundtrack . By the time the \" Super Phatt \" beats of rapper Jucee Froot's ' Danger ' -{ Absolutely }- \" Exploded\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca3 \" into the already 'frenzied' cinema that I happened to be in ....heralding the funky credits at the end... I was entirely cognizant of having thoroughly {\u2755} enjoyed the final act of \" Birds Of Prey \" . Suffice to say that the satisfyingly lengthy & Totally Mad { \" Carnival Of Death + Funhouse Mirrors + Ghouls ( Goons ) \" } 'Finale' fight sequences, rife with the 4 - { Yes \"Four\", in that ( -even- ) Cassandra Cain.. the young girl (\u2755) in the story ...partook in the action } - other female principal actors led by Harley Quinn, in the 'fight of their lives' in Both ' serious & dramatic ' - As Well As - ' meretriciously & lavishly Comedic fashion ' . . . . { More Than } elicited its required response from me. Not to mention the fact that I was able to { -Joyously- } observe ...yet again... that even a ( Seriously \ud83d\ude1c ) 'Wacky-As-Bats' film like this can come packaged with a few Good & Uplifting Ideals mixed in there... 'somewhere' ....{ Eg. Sisterhood, Second Chances, Taking the higher ground -( Even )- if it means risking one's life towards that end .....etc. } .\n\nIt became strikingly self-evident... ( to me atleast ) ..Very Early on in the picture that Ewan McGregor's Wildly, Colourfully, Despotically Evil \" Black Mask ->- a.k.a Roman Sionis \" might just as well have been an amalgam of -{ Both }- 'Harvey Two-Face' -{ And }- 'The Riddler' from Joel Schumacher's \" Batman Forever \" . Which would put \" Birds Of Prey \" , by way of a broad, loose aggregate, at a - { Sort Of } - weird cross between -( say )- a 'Batman Forever' ( 1995 ) & a 'Moulin Rouge' ( 2001 ) ; with a generous handful of some of the more Nefarious aspects of -( say )- something like the Iconic 1990 Mafia Classic 'Goodfellas' - { or, for that matter, literally... just about ->- ( Any ) ->- other \" Gloriously Profane \u26d4 \" & - Very - Violent big budget Adults-Only film out there } - thrown into the mix, as well. Now, ' In - And - Of - Itself ' . . . that wouldn't \" Necessarily \" be a bad thing. But once all those \" Rampant { \ud83d\udca5\u2757} Mf-s and F-s and B-s \" - and a whole lot more - start flying around as freely as ever , you { - Seriously - } find yourself being rudely 'Ripped' out of the otherwise 'nice and cozy' comic-book movie \" Suspension Of Disbelief \" that you might have been experiencing previously . . . . & thrust into what could easily be \"Just another huge, messy - { and yes . . Adult } - high stakes action Crime Drama \" .\n\nAnd that brings us squarely to my ->- { Absolute } ->- No.1 Gripe about Birds Of Prey. Let me put it this way. Would it's upcoming ( and very -Obviously- talented ) Director have ' Willingly ' allowed a young daughter of her { -- Own -- } , ( Hypothetically Speaking, Of Course ), to play the part of the aforementioned 'Hopelessly Compulsive' pickpocket ( & product of a 'Horribly' broken home ) Cassandra . . . . Get This . . . . that -- { \u2b50\u2b50 13 \u00bd \u2b50\u2b50 } -- year old Ella Jay Basco \ud83d\udc69 plays in the picture. Now to those of you who { -Have Already- } seen the movie ( & pretty much - know - where I'm going with this )... do hear me out. I { - Entirely- } understand that Ella is a 'Professional' Actor just taking a given Character off a page, & bringing her to Life. But I ask atleast the - { Parents Of Young Children } - among you . . . . . . . given - ( All ) - that Ella has to witness & partake in over the course of progression of the whole story : from the Profound Glorification of theft, to the often Profound levels of Outright Bloodletting & Gore, to the - { Very } - \" disturbingly \" liberal\ud83c\udf88use of Profanity . . . right the way thru said picture . . . ' And All Points Inbetween ' . I mean... could the scriptwriters - Seriously - not have written the part for say an 17-19 year old teenage girl instead { At the very least (\u2757) } ....with more or less the - { Very Same } - desired effect\u2754\u2755. \u2b50\u2b50 Just Saying \u2b50\u2b50 .\n\nSummation : Well, The Film ->- { Most Certainly } ->- Succeeds In Its Attempts To Be A \" Non-Stop And Splendidly Chaotic , Almost Psychedelic Kaleidoscope Of { - Vivid \ud83c\udf6d - } , Vibrant And Mercilessly Unrelenting Mayhem , Colour And Carnage \" . . . . . All At Once Reminiscent Of Films Like ' Joseph & The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat ' ( Video - 1999 ) , { - In The ' Purely ' Visual & Stylistic Sense , That Is To Say - } . Yes , That - Is \ud83c\udf20 - This Troubled Picture's ' Saving Grace ' . . . . . So I'm Giving It A Conflicted Yet Ultimately Decisive \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udd25 7.50 Marks Out Of 10 .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Birds of Prey Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3883843353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-01-16T07:15:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3053338/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Margot Robbie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm3053338?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harley Quinn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935541/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mary Elizabeth Winstead"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm0935541?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Helena Bertinelli"}, {"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm0935541?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "The Huntress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000191/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ewan McGregor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm0000191?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Roman Sionis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0582149/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Messina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm0582149?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Victor Zsasz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1352845/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "David Ury"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm1352845?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sleazy Breeder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9698429/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Izabel Pakzad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm9698429?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Shallow Friend #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11327403/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kc Strubbe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm11327403?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Na\u00efve Teammate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8698119/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Paloma Rabinov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm8698119?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bitchy Teammate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001609/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rosie Perez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm0001609?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Renee Montoya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0810619/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jurnee Smollett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm0810619?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dinah Lance"}, {"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm0810619?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Black Canary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5300686/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ella Jay Basco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm5300686?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cassandra Cain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4399227/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ali Wong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm4399227?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ellen Yee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2381620/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sara Montez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm2381620?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shallow Friend #1"}, {"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm2381620?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kathrine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0076780/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Daniel Bernhardt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm0076780?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sionis' Chauffeur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11327404/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jacky Shu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7713068/characters/nm11327404?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Skeptical Teammate"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Chinese"], "Release Date": ["7 February 2020 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey"], "Filming Locations": ["Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$84,500,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$33,010,017,", "9 February 2020"], "Gross USA": ["$84,158,461"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$201,858,461"], "Production Co": ["Clubhouse Pictures (II)", "DC Entertainment", "Kroll & Co.

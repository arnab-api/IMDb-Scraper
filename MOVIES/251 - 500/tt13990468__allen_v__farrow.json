The production value was terrible and not to my level of quality. The 3rd episode is almost like they creators finally found their brains. I would delete the 1st two episodes and discard them. They are worthless.\n\nThe use of the taped phone calls in the 3rd episode is paramount in this entire production. Forget the video of Dylan where Mia is asking questions. Listen to the phone conversation. The entire ending of the story is right there. If you don't see it you are not paying attention. I'd like to hear more of the taped phone conversations.\n\nFor those people giving 1 or 10 ratings and pushing your personal opinions on Farrow or Allen, you are missing the point of reviewing this production. I see a lot of anguish and hate on both sides, which make your reviews worthless.\n\nOn a private view, I agree with the one reporter who said that it still hurts, that he will never watch a Woody Allen movie again.\n\n(final edit) I just got finished with the fourth episode.\n\nI think the State Attorney, Frank Marco, is a powerful conclusion for the production. His comments are strong, but I disagree with his decision to not prosecute. I was sickened by the \"dark forces will not prevail\" comment from Woody. The interview with the adopted sisters/brothers is powerful.\n\nThere is nothing else to say, Woody Allen is a genius writer, director and manipulator. The final two episodes puts the final nail in the coffin.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3880108313", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmODczNzctZTk0YS00ZjAyLTg3NWMtYWQ0ZTY0YzQyYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZmODczNzctZTk0YS00ZjAyLTg3NWMtYWQ0ZTY0YzQyYTcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Allen V.

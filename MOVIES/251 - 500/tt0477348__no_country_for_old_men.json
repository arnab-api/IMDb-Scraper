I know this sounds very radical, but I have seen all of their films and don't think either film is as good or creative as OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? or THE HUDSUCKER PROXY or RAISING ARIZONA or THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE. Now OH BROTHER did at least some attention from the Oscars, but not nearly as much as the first two mentioned--even though OH BROTHER is amazing and a very easy film to see multiple times.\n\nAs far as acting goes, it was very good all the way around. Josh Brolin was just fine, Javier Bardem was even scarier than the Biker of the Apocalypse in RAISING ARIZONA and Tommy Lee Jones really came off best of the three in a very subdued but likable role.\n\nNO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is not a comedy, so people expecting laughs will sure be in for a surprise when they see this film. Instead, it's a very bloody, tense and occasionally difficult to watch suspense film that pays off in most every way except for a very unsatisfying ending. Even though I dislike violent films, I must admit that NO COUNTRY sure handled it amazingly well and kept my attention. It certainly was directed exceptionally well. I just hope its success doesn't encourage the Coen's to abandon comedy--which, I think, is much more their forte.\n\nWell, considering this film has 50000002 reviews so far, I think I'll stop here. Suffice to say it's a very good film but certainly NOT a film to let your kids see due to its very, very graphic violence.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No Country for Old Men", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi145883417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3ODk1NTY3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE3NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3ODk1NTY3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE3NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "No Country for Old Men Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-11-29T10:20:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000169/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tommy Lee Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0000169?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ed Tom Bell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000982/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josh Brolin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0000982?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Llewelyn Moss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0531808/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kelly Macdonald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0531808?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Carla Jean Moss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002128/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tess Harper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0002128?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Loretta Bell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0740535/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stephen Root"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0740535?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Man who hires Wells"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0335275/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Beth Grant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0335275?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carla Jean's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0350337/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kit Gwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0350337?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sheriff Bell's Secretary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2655195/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Chip Love"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm2655195?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Man in Ford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000849/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Javier Bardem"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0000849?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Anton Chigurh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carson Wells"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226813/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Garret Dillahunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0226813?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Wendell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179224/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Barry Corbin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0179224?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ellis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003923/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rodger Boyce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0003923?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "El Paso Sheriff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0715768/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ana Reeder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0715768?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Poolside Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0394308/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Zach Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0477348/characters/nm0394308?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Strangled Deputy"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "Mexico"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["21 November 2007 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["No Country for Old Men"], "Filming Locations": ["Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA"], "Budget": ["$25,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$1,202,000,", "11 November 2007"], "Gross USA": ["$74,283,625"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$171,627,166"], "Production Co": ["Paramount Vantage", "Miramax", "Scott Rudin Productions"], "Runtime": ["122 min"], "Sound Mix": ["SDDS", "Dolby Digital", "DTS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

They know how silly they must sound at times.  Remember the episode where Dawson had his birthday and Andee and him got drunk and he just leveled into everybody?  Do you remember what he said to Joey?  \" Joey, the only fifteen year old I know that needs to find herself. \"\n\nTo say these teens are precocious is to say that Star Wars has a large following.  It's just not needed.  We all know that, but what makes the show so good is the characters, the writing, the setting, the direction, the production values, oh hell, everything makes this show good.  It really is one of a kind.\n\nWhat I like best about it is that Dawson is a dreamer.  He does not want to grow up to be \" Joe \" down the street.  He wants to be Spielberg.   And sometimes he takes flak for who he is.  But how many of us have dreamed? How many of us have taken flak for it?  So how many of us can relate to this in one way or another?\n\nI do agree however with the general census that Joshua Jackson is the best part of the show.  Pacey is down to earth and he is not as wordy as the other characters.  But his relationship with Andee is so complex and so refreshing that you yearn for his screen time, you get anxious to see what he is going to do next, and I do think he has the greatest range on the show.  In the final episode of the second year, when he finally made some sort of amends with his dad..... powerful stuff.\n\nI do like Joey and I think Katie Holmes is a wonderful actor, as is Van Der Beek and Williams. All in all this show is a refreshing taste of what it was like to be a teen and I applaud them for having the guts to tackle such delicate subjects as homosexuality and the difficulty in believing in God. That takes guts and they handle it with integrity and class.\n\nThere isn't a better show on TV and I look forward to every Friday ( here in Ontario ) to see what is going to happen next.  Just one complaint: When the hell are Dawson and Joey going to do it?\n\nAn excellent show!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Dawson's Creek: The Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2951152665", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VmNDdiMDItYmU4OS00ZWVmLThiNWMtZmIxZThmZGQ3ZDQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VmNDdiMDItYmU4OS00ZWVmLThiNWMtZmIxZThmZGQ3ZDQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home video trailer for this drama about four friends in a small coastal town", "uploadDate": "2010-01-16T14:50:34Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004735/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Van Der Beek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0004735?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dawson Leery"}, {"url": "#", "name": "128 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931329/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michelle Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0931329?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jen Lindley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "128 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0670526/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mary Beth Peil"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0670526?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Evelyn 'Grams' Ryan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "128 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0401799/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary-Margaret Humes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0401799?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gail Leery"}, {"url": "#", "name": "93 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0794128/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Wesley Shipp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0794128?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mitch Leery"}, {"url": "#", "name": "83 episodes, 1998-2001"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005311/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Busy Philipps"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0005311?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Audrey Liddell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2001-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005017/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Katie Holmes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0005017?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joey Potter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "128 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005045/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joshua Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0005045?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pacey Witter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "128 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005445/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kerr Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0005445?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jack McPhee"}, {"url": "#", "name": "113 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0720047/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nina Repeta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0720047?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bessie Potter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005243/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Meredith Monroe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118300/characters/nm0005243?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Andie McPhee"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1998-2003"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["20 January 1998 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Dawson's Creek"], "Filming Locations": ["Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, USA"], "Production Co": ["Outerbanks Entertainment", "Columbia TriStar Television", "Columbia TriStar Domestic Television"], "Runtime": ["60 min", "(128 episodes)"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

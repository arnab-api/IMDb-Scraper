I'm Shocked! MTV... Has A Solid TV Series?", "reviewBody": "--MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS--\n\nThe advertisements of Teen Wolf aired on MTV, or from my location, MuchMusic and I was skeptical of the show, thinking it was slated to be another Twilight. I am no fan of that film franchise that everyone seems to overrate, thus, I thought it would not appeal to me and grew annoyed with MTV about to feature another lackluster show, because the network doesn't have much interesting to offer in my opinion.\n\nSo one night, I decided to give the series a look while on the web, running behind about 4 or 5 episodes and after watching and catching up on all of them, to my dismay, I was hooked on this series! Now, I anticipate every episode that gets aired and immensely enjoy all of them, something I never thought was possible with any MTV program. I have to commend MTV on creating a series that makes me feel upset if I happen to miss it.\n\nThe show is loosely based on the 1985 comedy-drama film, Teen Wolf, where a young teen, wanting to be more than an average kid, has to cope with bearing the heredity of werewolf genes that derived from his father, and with the extraordinary abilities that accompany his life as a werewolf, makes him popular at school. I haven't watched the film factually, I only actually managed to seek out the trailer, and it looked pretty cheesy to me anyway so I couldn't care less about it or if the series followed its plot and characteristics bit for bit.\n\nMTV's Teen Wolf surely has a darker, suspenseful and edgier premise, and being an avid horror fan, is the reason why I really dig this show. One recurring factor about this show is that it has a great, well-balanced amount of horror, suspense and comedy. It maintains an fun thrill ride and by every commercial and by every end of an episode, there is always an event building up. A lot of potential is definitely going for the series.\n\nThis show is about a teenage social outcast at Beacon Hills High School, and a lacrosse player at the school that spends more time on the bench than playing. One night, he is bitten in the middle of the woods by a werewolf while in search of a dead body he hears about. After discovering his unwanted inner werewolf, and the remarkable abilities he gains from it that help his normal life out, he is forced to balance two lives (hiding the werewolf one) and protect those meaningful to him.\n\nTyler Posey plays the aforementioned character known as Scott McCall and does a pretty good job acting the role. He has quite the charm in his on-screen presence and has nice chemistry with Crystal Reed, who plays his high school dream girl, Allison Argent. Dylan O'Brien is his genuine best friend on the show playing Stiles Stilinski, and by far, he signed up for a very colorful character that contributes so heavily. Stiles is practically the comic relief guy, who is there to help Scott keep himself collected from harming people during periods of werewolf rage. He's nerdy and suffers from ADD, but that doesn't stop him from being witty, intelligent and sarcastic which leads to some hilarious moments that Dylan executes splendidly. His lines and delivery are certainly top notch. With certainty, Stiles is my favorite character in the show.\n\nTyler Hoechlin is Derek Hale, a survivor of a fire that took out his family, is a mysterious werewolf in town seeking out his sister, Laura and allies and mentors Scott to help him master and control his werewolf abilities. A decent character so far in the show, the role is acted fairly. You also got Holland Roden as Lydia Martin, the mean-girl type and Jackson Whittemore, the lacrosse team captain played by Colton Haynes, both roles of which are being played pretty good.\n\nSpeaking from a post-teen perspective, Teen Wolf is a superb supernatural teenage series right now on cable television. I have to compliment Jeff Davis on this project as well as Russell Mulcahy, who added the horror element. It brings me back to the days of enjoying shows like Big Wolf on Campus, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. My only pet peeve is how there is only 12 episodes in the first season, I mean in my opinion, seasons should have at least 20 or more episodes.\n\nAnyway, 8/10 from me for one of my new favorite TV shows.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Comic-Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3872307481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA1MzU2YTktYjEzNy00OWI0LWI2NDctMWRmNmZiYmRjODY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA1MzU2YTktYjEzNy00OWI0LWI2NDctMWRmNmZiYmRjODY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the \"Teen Wolf\" Season 6B Trailer that premiered at Comic-Con 2017.", "uploadDate": "2017-07-21T02:56:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0692677/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tyler Posey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm0692677?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Scott McCall"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3729721/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dylan O'Brien"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm3729721?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stiles Stilinski"}, {"url": "#", "name": "92 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0100068/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "JR Bourne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm0100068?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chris Argent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "74 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388382/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tyler Hoechlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm0388382?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Derek Hale"}, {"url": "#", "name": "62 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2876098/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dylan Sprayberry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm2876098?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Liam Dunbar"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0445987/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ryan Kelley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm0445987?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Deputy Jordan Parrish"}, {"url": "#", "name": "45 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0319121/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Seth Gilliam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm0319121?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dr. Alan Deaton"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1555699/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Holland Roden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm1555699?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lydia Martin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000798/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Linden Ashby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm0000798?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sheriff Noah Stilinski"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0690754/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Melissa Ponzio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm0690754?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Melissa McCall"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2645189/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Shelley Hennig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm2645189?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Malia Tate"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3706952/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Crystal Reed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm3706952?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Allison Argent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2011-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3036914/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Arden Cho"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm3036914?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kira Yukimura"}, {"url": "#", "name": "44 episodes, 2014-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0092026/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ian Bohen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1567432/characters/nm0092026?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter Hale"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["5 June 2011 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Teen Wolf"], "Filming Locations": ["Palisades Charter High School, 15777 Bowdoin St, Pacific Palisades, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["MGM Television", "Music Television (MTV)"], "Runtime": ["41 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

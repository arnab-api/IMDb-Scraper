Not saying I'm with these or against those but I said it as it is! Also yes, there's (NO OTHER REASON) behind making this movie.\n\nAside from the political dirt and speaking only from an artistic point of view, This film fails miserably to maintain its uniqueness after the first few minutes. The movie starts in a great manner with a lot of expectations, twelve strangers are kidnapped and then hunted by a group of rich people, simple plot, normal acting, fast paced, unpredictable, funny and fun. All in the first exciting 15 mins.\n\nThen all of a sudden nearly by the middle of the movie it slows down...gets redundant, annoying and very predictable by the over used dull yet unrealistic hero character type, the type that knows it all, never fails and will accomplish anything. Beside the fact that it was falsely classified as horror and it has nothing to do with this genre! The dramatic plot is ridiculously idiotic, the reason why behind the film is completely unbelievable and unrealistic, the fighting scenes were lame as they lack any logic or credibility due to the hero never fails concept. Not to mention, the extremely stupid and predictable ending which was spotted a mile ahead.\n\nSadly this is a vivid example of a Great chance for a change and a feature that could've been unique which sadly turned into a wasted time and bad experience caused by all the wrong choices made by the filmmakers."}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi189054745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUzODFkYmUtMjNkYi00MzEzLTgwMzUtNGY3NTg3M2E1ZmIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUzODFkYmUtMjNkYi00MzEzLTgwMzUtNGY3NTg3M2E1ZmIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The most talked about movie of the year is the one nobody has seen \u2026 yet.

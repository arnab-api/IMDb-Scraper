The Best detective series ever!", "reviewBody": "\"Columbo\" is simply the best detective series ever! Peter Falk as Columbo is wonderful and I absolutely love him. Although the formula is pretty much the same for all the episodes, I never get enough of that cat-and-mouse game that Columbo is playing with his \"victims\". There are delightful elements of surprise in each episode, that also add up to the puzzle that Columbo himself is. Falk's acting is splendid, his mannerisms are unmistakable, he is so intelligent, natural and subtle. Falk's talent for comedy is a treasure. There is great humor in Columbo's antics, the script is smart and ingenious, and the guest stars, especially the villains, are always a treat. \n\nBesides, Columbo is a very intriguing character. We never really get to know who he is. Yes, there is mystery around Columbo, and catching a glimpse of the man behind the smoke screen is one of those things that have kept audiences watching for decades. He is indeed a fascinating character. \"Columbo\" will never get old, it's pure entertainment of the best kind. Splendid work!\n\nSeasons 1-7 are the best and remain unmatched by anything else on television, including Columbo later seasons. It's not only the charm of the 70's and 80's that make it fascinating, but it's mainly the quality of the scripts in the early years of \"Columbo\".", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Columbo: Seasons 1-7", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi62849305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJlY2I4OGUtOTY0NC00OGQ5LThlMTktMjhhZDNhNTZkZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJlY2I4OGUtOTY0NC00OGQ5LThlMTktMjhhZDNhNTZkZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Columbo: Seasons 1-7", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:30:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000393/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Falk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1466074/characters/nm0000393?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Columbo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "68 episodes, 1971-2003"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["1 March 1971 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Columbo"], "Filming Locations": ["Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["NBC Universal Television"], "Runtime": ["100 min", "(41 episodes)", "75 min", "(27 episodes)"], "Sound Mix": ["Mono", "(45 episodes)", "Stereo", "(24 episodes)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

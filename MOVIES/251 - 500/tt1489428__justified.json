When so much on TV falls into one box or another, Justified makes its own way. \n\nThis has one of the strongest casts on television. Many of the recurring actors were written for only a few episodes. Then, they created such dynamic characters, they have been brought back time and again. Walton Goggins and Tim Olyphant (as well as their supporting cast) are sincerely underrated as actors. They carry every scene they are in and when they are together, it is impossible to turn away.\n\nThere is a wit and humor to this show. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense and then will zing a one-liner at you. I've never laughed and cringed so much in my life.\n\nI am so glad this was renewed for a fourth season and it is the only show I care about watching.\n\nIf you are going to check it out, make sure you watch whatever season you pick from the beginning. Season one had many stand alone episodes. However, season two and season three involved complex plots that slowly burned into sensational finales. If you try to jump into the middle you may not enjoy it because of the subtle complexities in the plots.\n\nPlease check it out because it is one of the best dramas on television with a sensational cast.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Painkiller", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi963026457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk4MzQ5ODUxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk3MTMxNw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk4MzQ5ODUxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk3MTMxNw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A preview trailer for the upcoming season of \"Justified.\"", "uploadDate": "2011-12-07T16:33:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0648249/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Timothy Olyphant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm0648249?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Raylan Givens"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141710/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joelle Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm0141710?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ava Crowder"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1801624/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Erica Tazel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm1801624?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rachel Brooks"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0954036/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Natalie Zea"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm0954036?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Winona Hawkins"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1635108/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "David Meunier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm1635108?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Johnny Crowder"}, {"url": "#", "name": "35 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0780678/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nick Searcy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm0780678?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Art Mullen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686009/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jacob Pitts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm0686009?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tim Gutterson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324658/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Walton Goggins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm0324658?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Boyd Crowder"}, {"url": "#", "name": "74 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0122716/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jere Burns"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm0122716?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wynn Duffy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1355563/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jonathan Kowalsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1489428/characters/nm1355563?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mike"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["16 March 2010 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Lawman"], "Filming Locations": ["Green Valley, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["FX Productions", "Timberman-Beverly Productions", "Nemo Films"], "Runtime": ["44 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

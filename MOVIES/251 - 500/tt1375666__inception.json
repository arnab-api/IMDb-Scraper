My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "10th Anniversary Dream Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2959588889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.", "uploadDate": "2020-08-02T21:45:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000138/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0000138?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cobb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0680983/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elliot Page"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0680983?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ariadne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0913822/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ken Watanabe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0913822?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Saito"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0614165/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cillian Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0614165?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Robert Fischer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0182839/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marion Cotillard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0182839?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000323/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Michael Caine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0000323?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Miles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2581730/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tai-Li Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm2581730?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tadashi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3960408/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Magnus Nolan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm3960408?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "James (20 Months Old)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0330687/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0330687?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Arthur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0362766/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tom Hardy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0362766?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Eames"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2438307/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dileep Rao"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm2438307?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Yusuf"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000297/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tom Berenger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0000297?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Browning"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000592/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pete Postlethwaite"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0000592?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maurice Fischer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001305/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lukas Haas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm0001305?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3637500/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Claire Geare"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375666/characters/nm3637500?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Phillipa (3 Years Old)"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "UK"], "Language": ["English", "Japanese", "French"], "Release Date": ["16 July 2010 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Oliver's Arrow"], "Filming Locations": ["Bedfordshire, England, UK"], "Budget": ["$160,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$62,785,337,", "18 July 2010"], "Gross USA": ["$292,576,195"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$836,836,967"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Legendary Entertainment", "Syncopy"], "Runtime": ["148 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "DTS", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

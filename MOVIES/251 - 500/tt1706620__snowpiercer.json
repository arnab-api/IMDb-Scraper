Secluded from the outer world, the survivors are stratified by social class, the highest at the front (a perpetual-motion engine) and the lowest at the back. The linear (in more ways than one) story is quite simple, the underprivileged bunch at the back fighting its way, car after car, all the way to the front to gain control of their own destiny. Through the allegory progression, the audience witnesses a rich pageantry of environments \u2013 rough workplace, lush greenhouse, giant aquarium, plush lounge, and more.\n\nThe impressive cast is well assembled. Chris Evans sheds his \"All American\" heartthrob image to play this perhaps his first heavy-weight role as an earthy leader of the revolution. John Hurt is the semi-disabled wise old man, a rich reservoir of knowledge. Other key members of the group include Jamie Bell as the young follower, Octavia Spencer as a mother searching for a missing child \"drafted\" by the ruling class for some obscure purpose, and Song Kang-ho as a Korean security expert. The show-stealing personas, however, are on the opposite side. Most delicious is Tilda Swinton, barely recognizable with ingenious makeup (essentially of a dental nature) playing the spokesperson for the dictator. Allison Pill (so impressive as Zelda Fitzgerald in \"Midnight in Paris\") is another manifestation of eccentricity, a pregnant kindergarten teacher, all sweetness until she produces a gun and starts shooting. The dictator is competently played by Ed Harris.\n\nThe movie is quite long (a little over 2 hours) and does not hurry itself as most blockbuster thrillers would do. Instead, it takes its time with careful, well-crafted character development. But it does hold the audience's attention with excellent acting and artsy photography."}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1214688537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In a future where a failed global-warming experiment kills off all life on the planet except for a lucky few that boarded the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe, where a class system evolves.", "uploadDate": "2014-05-31T08:20:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0262635/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0262635?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Curtis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000438/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ed Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0000438?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Wilford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0842770/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tilda Swinton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0842770?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818055/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Octavia Spencer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0818055?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tanya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2163344/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ko Asung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm2163344?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Yona"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3297698/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Luke Pasqualino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm3297698?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Grey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3116983/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Adnan Haskovic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm3116983?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Franco the Younger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0661950/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Steve Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0661950?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Fuyu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0814280/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kang-ho Song"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0814280?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Namgoong Minsoo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000457/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0000457?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gilliam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068260/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jamie Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0068260?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Edgar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001971/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ewen Bremner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0001971?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Andrew"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0683467/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alison Pill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0683467?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0412096/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Vlad Ivanov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm0412096?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Franco the Elder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3883136/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Emma Levie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1706620/characters/nm3883136?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Claude"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["South Korea", "Czech Republic"], "Language": ["English", "Korean", "French", "Japanese", "Czech", "German"], "Release Date": ["11 July 2014 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Snowpiercer"], "Filming Locations": ["Barrandov Studios, Prague, Czech Republic"], "Budget": ["$39,200,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$171,187,", "29 June 2014"], "Gross USA": ["$4,563,650"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$86,758,912"], "Production Co": ["SnowPiercer", "Moho Film", "Opus Pictures"], "Runtime": ["126 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

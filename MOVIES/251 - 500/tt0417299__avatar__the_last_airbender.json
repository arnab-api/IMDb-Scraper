The creators of Avatar have really crafted an artistic piece of fun and creative storytelling that is a rare gem for American TV. Avatar has strength in all the major areas of film and story, starting at ground level with an exceptionally believable world setting where war is taking place among the different nations. The main characters who find themselves caught in this struggle are three teens named Katara, Sokka, and Aang (the Avatar) who have set forth to bring harmony to the world through their influence and through the powers of the still developing Avatar. There is lot of humor and fun in this show, and you can't help but to really love these characters and their pets. But this is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots and stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of the show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chronologically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by the end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds and quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points of moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winning combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Avatar: The Last Airbender: Book One - Water - Volume One", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4010411801", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMwMzM3Y2ItZjc4Ni00MDlkLThmOWUtYTk1ZjliNjEzYTUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMwMzM3Y2ItZjc4Ni00MDlkLThmOWUtYTk1ZjliNjEzYTUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home video trailer for this anime show", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T14:53:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0048389/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dee Bradley Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417299/characters/nm0048389?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Appa"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0926165/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mae Whitman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417299/characters/nm0926165?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Katara"}, {"url": "#", "name": "60 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002364/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dante Basco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417299/characters/nm0002364?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Prince Zuko"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0538683/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mako"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417299/characters/nm0538683?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Uncle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2005-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0878940/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Zach Tyler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417299/characters/nm0878940?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aang"}, {"url": "#", "name": "60 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1123750/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jack De Sena"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417299/characters/nm1123750?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sokka"}, {"url": "#", "name": "60 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1402100/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michaela Jill Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417299/characters/nm1402100?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Toph"}, {"url": "#", "name": "37 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["21 February 2005 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Nickelodeon Avatar: The Last Airbender"], "Production Co": ["Nickelodeon Animation Studios"], "Runtime": ["23 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

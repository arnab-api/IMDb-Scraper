As many of you would know this movie is sort of like a tribute to the pulp stories written back in the 40s and 50s which have punchy and witty dialogue and over the top violence. The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .\n\nSo if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.\n\nSpoilers ahead(duh): For those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.\n\nSorry for the huge review..", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2620371481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzgxMTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMTk0NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzgxMTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMTk0NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.", "uploadDate": "2015-12-16T10:51:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000619/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tim Roth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110912/characters/nm0000619?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Pumpkin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0522503/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Lovelace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110912/characters/nm0522503?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000168/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Samuel L.

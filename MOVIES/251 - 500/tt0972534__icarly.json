Yet, iCarly manages to make me laugh.\n\nFirst it was the show All That, then The Amanda Show, next Drake and Josh and now iCarly. All these shows are funny and good for the entire family, the reason is that all these show are created and directed by Dan Schneider. Dan Schneider is an awesome mastermind for kids comedy. Dan also did a awesome job in \"What I like about you\".\n\nThe iCarly show starts Miranda Cosgrove a very appealing girl who makes a good job when working on comedy. Jenette McCurdy and Nathan Kress have made cameo appearances on many shows but they are stars in this show, their future looks bright. The show iCarly sometimes doesn't make me laugh, at times it gets a little boring, sometimes I get a good laugh and sometimes I run out of breath when laughing, and mostly its really entertaining.\n\nLucas (the one who plays Fred on youtube) made a guest star appearance on one episode, I don't find Fred to be funny, but when the show is directed by a mastermind like Dan Schneider, you can expect great laughs. Also on many times there is a moral in the episodes, parents I recommend that your kids watch this show."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "iCarly: Season One", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2668496665", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWFkOWNhMjctMjk5YS00N2Q3LTljN2YtYTY0OTVlM2FhMDBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWFkOWNhMjctMjk5YS00N2Q3LTljN2YtYTY0OTVlM2FhMDBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home video trailer for this show", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T15:25:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1388927/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Miranda Cosgrove"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0972534/characters/nm1388927?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carly Shay"}, {"url": "#", "name": "95 episodes, 2007-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1390614/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jennette McCurdy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0972534/characters/nm1390614?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sam Puckett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "95 episodes, 2007-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2470538/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Noah Munck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0972534/characters/nm2470538?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gibby"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2007-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0999117/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jerry Trainor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0972534/characters/nm0999117?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Spencer Shay"}, {"url": "#", "name": "95 episodes, 2007-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0470941/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nathan Kress"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0972534/characters/nm0470941?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Freddie Benson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "95 episodes, 2007-2012"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["8 September 2007 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Untitled Dan Schneider Project"], "Filming Locations": ["Eastern Columbia Building - 849 S.

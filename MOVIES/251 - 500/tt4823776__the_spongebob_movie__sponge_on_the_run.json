It's been a while since I watched it but there are some really memorable episodes that I consider to be great. It's really nostalgic for me and it has moments of genius as well. The Spongebob movie: Sponge on the run is not a moment of SpongeBob genius.\n\nThere are some good moments but I'm going to forget it in a day or less.\n\nI thought the cinematography was good, it was a huge improvement from the television show from a technical standpoint. The animation was improved on heaps but I'm not really sure what they were going for. It's almost like the filmmakers wanted a more realistic look but they didn't fully commit. SpongeBob is at it's best when utilising animation to its fullest potential, so, again, I have no idea what they were thinking.\n\nThere is quite a lot of social and political commentary in this movie, sadly it's all very heavy handed and annoying. A few times a character would straight up say how clich\u00e9d and uninteresting the movie is, exactly like deadpool did. Just because you know that your movie is clich\u00e9d and unoriginal doesn't make it less clich\u00e9d and boring. I didn't like it much in deadpool and I like it even less here. There are many more themes that are tackled, but they are all very on the nose as well.\n\nDespite being far worse than the show, there are still some great gags throughout, some of them really subtle which I respect a lot. I won't spoil the film, but my favourite gag comes early on during a scene where Plankton tries to negotiate with Mr. Krabs for the secret formula. I don't want to say what it is because it is really subtle but I found it hilarious.\n\nMusic is kind of a big part about Sponge on the run. Some of the songs were good, like the song during the zombie dance scene. But I found two of them to be intolerable. The first song that plays and the end credits song.\n\nFinally one of my biggest issues is SpongeBob's character. This point actually applies for most characters, but SpongeBob is the biggest victim of this. He is a victim of lazy writing, he doesn't act like he does in any other SpongeBob property. If you are a huge fan of SpongeBob you won't understand half of the choices he makes in this film. Like I said I'm not even a huge fan and it still annoyed me a lot. I think his character is so bad that even if Spongebob didn't exist prior to this film, his action's still wouldn't make any sense to me and I'd think he's a really bad protagonist.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Big Game Spot", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3578838809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA5YjBjM2MtZTJiNy00ZDBjLTllYjAtOTBhZjAwYjVkMWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA5YjBjM2MtZTJiNy00ZDBjLTllYjAtOTBhZjAwYjVkMWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This Memorial Day weekend, SpongeBob SquarePants, his best friend Patrick Star and the rest of the gang from Bikini Bottom hit the big screen in the first-ever all CGI SpongeBob motion picture event.

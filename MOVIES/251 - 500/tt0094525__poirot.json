On all his cases, he is ably assisted by his Watson, Captain Hastings, and his secretary Miss Lemon. The series is set in the thirties, and the characters still carry the scars of the first world war with them, while at the same time omens of the next conflict are ever present. A fourth member of the cast is their modern Art Deco apartment building. The jazzy score gives an extra feeling for the period.\n\n Anyway, if you haven't seen this little gem already, don't miss it. It is as good as Agatha Christie's other detective series Miss Marple, with Joan Hickson.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Guest Stars Before They Were Stars", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi463318809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI1NzQ3MzQ1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzczNDk3MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI1NzQ3MzQ1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzczNDk3MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "There were some very famous people who guest starred on \"Poirot\" over the years.", "uploadDate": "2014-09-26T10:47:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0837064/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Suchet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094525/characters/nm0837064?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hercule Poirot"}, {"url": "#", "name": "70 episodes, 1989-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413946/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Philip Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094525/characters/nm0413946?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chief Inspector Japp"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 1989-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0292140/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hugh Fraser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094525/characters/nm0292140?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Captain Hastings"}, {"url": "#", "name": "43 episodes, 1989-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0602954/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pauline Moran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094525/characters/nm0602954?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Miss Lemon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 1989-2013"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English", "French"], "Release Date": ["18 January 1990 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Poirot"], "Filming Locations": ["The Charterhouse, Charterhouse Square, London, England, UK"], "Production Co": ["Carnival Film & Television", "London Weekend Television (LWT)", "Picture Partnership Productions"], "Runtime": ["100 min", "(14 episodes)", "50 min", "(36 episodes)", "90 min", "(20 episodes)"], "Sound Mix": ["Mono", "Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

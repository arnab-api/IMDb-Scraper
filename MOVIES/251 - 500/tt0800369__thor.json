Thankfully, I am glad to say he learnt a great deal from those mistakes. Of course, this is no Henry V, this is just pure popcorn entertainment but a thoroughly enjoyable introduction to Thor for the big screen. Chris Hemsworth played the part with a lot of energy, charisma and I have to admit from a bloke's point of view, annoying good looks. Anthony Hopkins added much needed heavyweight presence as Odin but its a role he has quite frankly played a gazillion times but I never tire of it, so I'm not complaining. In a year long span of brilliantly playing vastly different roles from psychotic to swashbuckling heroine, Natalie Portman this time plays the sweet determined scientist girl who falls for the strangely mannered good looking guy. Nothing too taxing for any of them but they do give a re-assuring aura about them.\n\nThe visuals were quite spectacular, mainly, the sweeping canvas of Asgard. The action scenes were also good though I thought could have been executed better with lesser use of the fast cut edit style that is too often the norm in action film these days.\n\nThere is plenty of humour when Thor is on Earth but not in a put-off way as there is a suitable contrast of a serious tone with everything set in Asgard. Even though the storyline was somewhat predictable, it was still a riveting one.\n\nFor those like me, who were concerned about how Thor fits into the established Marvel connected universe set by the Iron Man films need not worry. That is just another thing that Branagh and crew pulls off very well. We can now fully embrace the forthcoming Avengers where a God, a man who transforms into a giant green beast, and a man who flies in a hi tech amour suit can share the same screen. So its all coming together nicely.\n\nAnd make sure you stay for the end credit scenes. In case you did not know of this before, I urge you to go back to the previous films (Iron Man 1 & 2, Incredible Hulk) and watch the end of credit sequences if you haven't already. They tell a separate story strand that will culminate to a certain upcoming Marvel movie. The end credit sequence of Thor is the most fascinating yet as it actually takes a major plot development in the story strand ;) And it was the longest bloody end of credit sequence I've ever seen in any movie! One last thing, the film I saw was in 3d and once again, it practically nearly ruined all the action scenes for me. In the non action scenes, it was pretty useless and just simply made the film much darker.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1431476761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMwNDg4NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ3MjIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMwNDg4NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ3MjIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The powerful but arrogant warrior Thor is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard and sent to live amongst humans on Earth, where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.", "uploadDate": "2011-02-19T11:43:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1165110/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Hemsworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm1165110?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Thor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1089991/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tom Hiddleston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm1089991?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Loki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001745/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0001745?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Erik Selvig"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0163988/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Clark Gregg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0163988?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Agent Coulson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0252961/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Idris Elba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0252961?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Heimdall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0038355/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tadanobu Asano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0038355?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hogun"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1526352/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jaimie Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm1526352?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sif"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0056770/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Adriana Barraza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0056770?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Isabela Alvarez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000204/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Natalie Portman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0000204?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jane Foster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000164/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anthony Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0000164?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Odin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0993507/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kat Dennings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0993507?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Darcy Lewis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272173/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Colm Feore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0272173?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "King Laufey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829032/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ray Stevenson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0829032?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Volstagg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2796047/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Josh Dallas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm2796047?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Fandral"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000623/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rene Russo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800369/characters/nm0000623?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Frigga"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["6 May 2011 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Thor, God of Thunder"], "Filming Locations": ["Galisteo, New Mexico, USA"], "Budget": ["$150,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$65,723,338,", "8 May 2011"], "Gross USA": ["$181,030,624"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$449,326,618"], "Production Co": ["Paramount Pictures", "Marvel Entertainment", "Marvel Studios"], "Runtime": ["115 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Datasat", "SDDS", "Dolby Surround 7.1", "Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

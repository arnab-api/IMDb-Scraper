I saw the first episode and was impressed but like with a lot of TV series I found good such as the X-files I just forgot about it and never watched it, anyway about 2 months ago I heard and advert on the radio for it and so watched it. I have been watching it religously since, I have missed most of series one and the first few episodes of series two which annoys me but every episode is great, well written and excellently acted and directed. What sets this out from other TV shows is the incredibly professional look, from the movie like cinematography to the brilliant acting, the writing is always very good and the plot twists always surprising whilst feasible. I wish I had watched it since series one. I am a fan of Marg Helgenberger, I find her very sexy, she is a gorgeous woman and this really made me finally decide to watch it, as I usually watch something from the movie channels on saturdays. The show has a great production value and its got that Bruckheimer class about it. They always have good directors such as Danny Cannon who also did the underrated Stallone flick Judge Dredd. All the actors are good the two younger guys played by Gary Dourdon and George Eads and the nice looking Joja Fox and they and Marg are all led by the ultra intelligent Gill Grissom, excellently played by the one of the shows producers William Peterson, the lines Grissom has are classic. The show has some generally interesting characters who are all likeable. This show is pure TV excellence and it gets a bonus thumbs up because they cast one of my fave actors Mark Dacascos in an episode which should reach the UK in about 7 weeks. 10/10"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "CSI: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2534388761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk2MmYxYTEtNjljNC00MGYwLWJkOWMtZDZjMmFlMjc5YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk2MmYxYTEtNjljNC00MGYwLWJkOWMtZDZjMmFlMjc5YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2016-06-03T21:14:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0247040/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Eads"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0247040?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nick Stokes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "335 episodes, 2000-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004371/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert David Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0004371?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Al Robbins"}, {"url": "#", "name": "327 episodes, 2000-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0289080/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jorja Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0289080?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sara Sidle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "297 episodes, 2000-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001339/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Marg Helgenberger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0001339?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Catherine Willows"}, {"url": "#", "name": "264 episodes, 2000-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0676973/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "William Petersen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0676973?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "CSI Dr. Gil Grissom"}, {"url": "#", "name": "193 episodes, 2000-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0844172/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eric Szmanda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0844172?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Greg Sanders"}, {"url": "#", "name": "329 episodes, 2000-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002117/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Paul Guilfoyle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0002117?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Captain Jim Brass"}, {"url": "#", "name": "317 episodes, 2000-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2003884/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Berman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm2003884?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Phillips"}, {"url": "#", "name": "284 episodes, 2000-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005120/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wallace Langham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0005120?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Hodges"}, {"url": "#", "name": "245 episodes, 2003-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235427/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gary Dourdan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247082/characters/nm0235427?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Warrick Brown"}, {"url": "#", "name": "184 episodes, 2000-2015"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "Canada"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish", "American Sign Language"], "Release Date": ["6 October 2000 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["C.S.I."], "Filming Locations": ["Las Vegas, Nevada, USA"], "Production Co": ["Alliance Atlantis Communications", "CBS Paramount Network Television", "CBS Productions"], "Runtime": ["60 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "Dolby Digital", "DTS", "(DTS 5.1)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

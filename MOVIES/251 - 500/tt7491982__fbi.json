I watch these shows to get away from the constant political bombardment of the media. The constant anti-conservative drumbeat. The constant pushing of the 'woke' agenda. I watch crime dramas to see the good guys get the bad guys.\n\nSo last night's FBI episode was about two guys in masks stealing a big tanker of bomb-making fuel and killing two customs agent in the process. Ammonia-something. The perps were described at least six times as being WHITE males. Later it turn they were part of a rightwing anti-government network who admired Timothy McVeigh, who opposed the removal of Confederate monuments, and who had targeted large buildings in NYC named after liberals. I mean, this counldn't be more blatant political messaging. And it's incorrect.\n\nIf you really want to show terrorist bombings that are the MOST representative, then you have to show Muslims doing it. If you want to show representative violent anarchists, then you need to portray BLM or Antifa. But leftwing CBS wouldn't do that in a milllion years.\n\nHere's an idea. Just leave ALL politics out of it."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "First Look Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi251968281", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-08-27T20:28:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1335291/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Missy Peregrym"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7491982/characters/nm1335291?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Special Agent Maggie Bell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "54 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005438/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jeremy Sisto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7491982/characters/nm0005438?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine"}, {"url": "#", "name": "53 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1668372/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Boyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7491982/characters/nm1668372?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Special Agent Stuart Scola"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 2019-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3213011/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Taylor Anthony Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7491982/characters/nm3213011?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kelly Moran"}, {"url": "#", "name": "29 episodes, 2019-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4976368/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Zeeko Zaki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7491982/characters/nm4976368?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Special Agent Omar Adom 'OA' Zidan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "54 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5532412/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ebonee Noel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7491982/characters/nm5532412?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Analyst Kristen Chazal"}, {"url": "#", "name": "41 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1004211/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alana De La Garza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7491982/characters/nm1004211?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Special Agent in Charge Isobel Castille"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 2019-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1429853/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James Chen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7491982/characters/nm1429853?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ian Lim"}, {"url": "#", "name": "27 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["25 September 2018 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["FBI"], "Filming Locations": ["New York, USA"], "Production Co": ["Wolf Films", "CBS Television Studios", "Universal Television"], "Runtime": ["60 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

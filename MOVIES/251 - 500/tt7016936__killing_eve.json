The character of the professional killer is absolutely stunning. Fabulous performance. The best female villain I have ever seen. You should just forget about the story plot, and just watch her face, her movement and her interractions with people. The best female-antiheroine capable of doing anything. Although she is a villain, she is fascinating.\n\nAs for Eve, not such a brilliant situation. We all know Sandra Oh from Grey's Anatomy where she played a weird emotionless brilliant surgeon. However, here Eve was made too soft, too homey, too wifey, too naive for my taste. And her acting is far more boring.\n\nOtherwise, the cast is great scenery is great, and I appreciate that Moscow was not shown as a poor dump, but a place where rich and powerful people live as well, with luxurious places to go, etc, which is really closer to the truth nowadays.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Break Up | Season 3 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4271554073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVhMGYxYTAtZDhiYy00ZGI3LWEwY2EtMGNmY2ZlNWViOTYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVhMGYxYTAtZDhiYy00ZGI3LWEwY2EtMGNmY2ZlNWViOTYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\n\n#KillingEve Season 3 returns 2 weeks early on Sunday, April 12 at 9pm on BBC America and AMC.", "uploadDate": "2020-03-27T16:09:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3069650/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jodie Comer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7016936/characters/nm3069650?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Villanelle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2018-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0789716/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Fiona Shaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7016936/characters/nm0789716?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carolyn Martens"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2018-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1711652/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Owen McDonnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7016936/characters/nm1711652?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Niko Polastri"}, {"url": "#", "name": "16 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0644897/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sandra Oh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7016936/characters/nm0644897?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eve Polastri"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2018-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0091035/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kim Bodnia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7016936/characters/nm0091035?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Konstantin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7780301/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sean Delaney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7016936/characters/nm7780301?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kenny Stowton"}, {"url": "#", "name": "15 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "UK", "Italy"], "Language": ["English", "French", "Spanish", "Catalan", "Russian", "Polish", "Romanian"], "Release Date": ["8 April 2018 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Killing Eve"], "Filming Locations": ["Tuscany, Italy"], "Production Co": ["Sid Gentle Films", "Endeavor Content", "BBC America"], "Runtime": ["42 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

The story works as an engaging, fascinating character study; at the beginning of the story, Mark is a socially maladjusted reject, and even after several million 'friends' and a few billion dollars later, he remains pretty much the same.\n\nThe outstanding acting, style and direction, as well as the great script armed to the teeth with sharp dialogue is what people are likely to miss by dismissing it as a mere 'Facebook movie'.\n\nEven if it were just a \"movie about Facebook\", why is such subject matter off-limits? Things that have become a large part of our culture shouldn't be reflected in our art? Or, is it because of that? That technology is such a scary thing and needs to be dismissed? The indisputable fact is that everything that's going on with social networking and the world of the Internet is incorporated into the ideas of a certain corner of history, this one, which will be remembered as such, and \"The Social Network\" may very well be remembered as a film to define that era.\n\nSo please, this is one of the films to see this year. Don't get hung up on the idea that it's just a silly \"Facebook movie\", or else you'll be missing out on an excellent picture."}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Social Network: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4152690201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmMxZWQ2YjAtMDY3Yi00ZTU4LWEyY2ItM2E3MTgxYzEyOGEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpybA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmMxZWQ2YjAtMDY3Yi00ZTU4LWEyY2ItM2E3MTgxYzEyOGEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpybA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A story about the founders of the social-networking website, Facebook.", "uploadDate": "2010-07-17T07:24:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0251986/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jesse Eisenberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm0251986?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mark Zuckerberg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3728884/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bryan Barter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm3728884?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Billy Olson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001515/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Joseph Mazzello"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm0001515?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dustin Moskovitz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1940449/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Andrew Garfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm1940449?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Eduardo Saverin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4087600/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alecia Svensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm4087600?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Girl at Phoenix Club"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1498872/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "James Dastoli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm1498872?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Student Playing Facemash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2590079/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Scotty Crowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm2590079?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Student Playing Facemash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1719288/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Marcella Lentz-Pope"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm1719288?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Erica's Roommate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1913734/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rooney Mara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm1913734?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Erica Albright"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2951481/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dustin Fitzsimons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm2951481?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Phoenix Club President"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2557308/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Patrick Mapel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm2557308?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chris Hughes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1114723/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Toby Meuli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm1114723?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Phoenix Member Playing Facemash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4088378/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jami Owen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm4088378?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Student Playing Facemash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1498874/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robert Dastoli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm1498874?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Student Playing Facemash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1879820/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jayk Gallagher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1285016/characters/nm1879820?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Student Playing Facemash"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "French"], "Release Date": ["1 October 2010 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Social Network"], "Filming Locations": ["The Thirsty Scholar, 70 Beacon Street, Sommerville, Massachusetts, USA"], "Budget": ["$40,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$22,445,653,", "3 October 2010"], "Gross USA": ["$96,962,694"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$224,920,375"], "Production Co": ["Columbia Pictures", "Relativity Media", "Scott Rudin Productions"], "Runtime": ["120 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "DTS", "SDDS", "Dolby Surround 7.1"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

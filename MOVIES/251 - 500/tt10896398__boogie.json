While his parents pressure him to focus on earning a scholarship to an elite college, Boogie must find a way to navigate a new girlfriend, high school, on-court rivals and the burden of expectation. In theory this does sound like a good idea. I like the exploration of heritage and navigating through life. The script does have some fine dialogue that motivates this. But as a whole, Boogie is more of a disappointment. I can't really say disappointment since I went into this hardly any knowledge of what it would be about. The beginning sets-up nicely. It felt like it would be a feel-good sort of movie. Everything just seems to go on repeat after a while. Not necessarily in plot but rather characters.\n\nThe characters are the biggest issue here. I found all of them to be intolerable. There are hardly any good traits to be found. Boogie is a foolish person that only cares about sports. Usually you see change when it comes to character, but I saw little to no change here. I understand some of what he wants, but I just got annoyed by him. The movie is pretty boring since there's not much change. It felt more like I was watching than experiencing. At times I did feel entertained, but then it would fall back into the slump. Once again, the script isn't too bad and has all the right topics, but with the predictability and annoying characters, Boogie becomes something to be forgotten.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi578601241", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzdkOGZlMzctOWNkNS00NTRmLTlmNGQtMjQ1ZGFmMWZhOThhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzdkOGZlMzctOWNkNS00NTRmLTlmNGQtMjQ1ZGFmMWZhOThhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "From acclaimed writer, producer and restaurateur Eddie Huang comes his directorial debut BOOGIE, the coming-of-age story of Alfred \u201cBoogie\u201d Chin, a basketball phenom living in Queens, New York, who dreams of one day playing in the NBA.

You could really tell he loved his line of work, but also struggled with not completely becoming a thug. It was so nice to see him play such a different role for a change. It was real acting, not is normal eccentric character roles (don't get me wrong I love those as well) Christian Bale was also fantastic; you can see his conflict he was having with the job he was tasked to do vs. his own convictions.\n\nMarion Cotillard was stunning and Channing Tatum was such a psycho as Pretty Boy Floyd you hated him and loved him at the same time.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the music. The old nostalgic feeling and the narrator on the radio was one of my favorite bits that was used through out the film.\n\nOver all the movie was excellent, my only issue is with the title. I think simply calling it Dillinger or Bye, Bye Black bird would be better. I think the title really takes away from the feeling of the movie."}, "duration": "PT2H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Public Enemies", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3372221209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNTIyMzA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4MTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNTIyMzA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4MTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Bale) sets his sights on American gangster John Dillinger (Depp) and others in an attempt to curb a rampant Chicago crime spree during the 1930s.", "uploadDate": "2009-03-06T18:32:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000288/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Christian Bale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0000288?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Melvin Purvis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164809/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0164809?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "'Red' Hamilton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0334318/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stephen Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0334318?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Baby Face Nelson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1722096/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Judd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm1722096?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Turnkey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2312716/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michael Vieau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm2312716?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ed Shouse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659547/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carey Mulligan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm1659547?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carol Slayman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000610/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Giovanni Ribisi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0000610?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Alvin Karpis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3156661/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Scherp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm3156661?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Earl Adams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0831601/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christian Stolte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0831601?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Charles Makley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John Dillinger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0920992/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Wenham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0920992?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Harry 'Pete' Pierpont"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001151/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Stephen Dorff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0001151?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Homer Van Meter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0457244/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "John Kishline"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0457244?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Guard Dainard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0751638/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "James Russo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm0751638?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Walter Dietrich"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1169522/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Wesley Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1152836/characters/nm1169522?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jim Leslie"}]}]}

All of this usually happened in the same episode. A great show for students of mythology, although the writers did incorporate their own ideas (into the mythological settings and characters) to give the show more texture and layers. The best part of the show was Xena and Gabrielle's intense affection, friendship and respect for one another. They are truly partners in everything they do and always willing to sacrifice for one another. However, there's plenty of comedy as well to keep the show from getting too serious.  The more episodes you watch, the more you'll like and understand the concept of the show, and how it works on different levels simultaneously. Very highly recommended."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Xena, Warrior Princess: Season Six", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3957457177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI4NDViYjYtYTc1NS00ZDhmLThiZDAtOWEzYjM5NjY0ZWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI4NDViYjYtYTc1NS00ZDhmLThiZDAtOWEzYjM5NjY0ZWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Anchor Bay Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-18T12:15:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005128/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lucy Lawless"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112230/characters/nm0005128?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Xena"}, {"url": "#", "name": "134 episodes, 1995-2001"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640488/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ren\u00e9e O'Connor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112230/characters/nm0640488?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gabrielle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "132 episodes, 1995-2001"}]}]}

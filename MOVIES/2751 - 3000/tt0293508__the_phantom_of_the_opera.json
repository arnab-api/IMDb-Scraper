So we knew not what to expect. But at the very opening, as the long-dead chandelier rises to life, swinging in what seems like one endless arc, and scatters the colour of memories about as it flames back to life, and the theatre is washed in colour and majesty not seen in decades... we both knew this was going to be good. And it was. \n\nWhen it comes to sets, scenery and cinematography, they spared no expense. Every scene is drenched in rich detail. At the risk of sounding the heretic, I must say that a movie version removes the limitations of space and time to set up the stage, and so has the upper hand in the scenery and sets department. Some of these shots must have taken weeks to compose, and I'm glad they invested the time. \n\nThe music is just wonderful. I'd dare say that even if you are not a musical fan, if you are at least romantically inclined, you will LOVE this movie. By the end of some songs, like, \"All I ask of you\" I'm restraining myself from singing the song out loud with them! \n\nThe movie kind of departs from the setting of the original silent movie, in which the Phantom is actually quite hideous. This Phantom is more \"mysterious\" than hideous. But the attraction between him and Christine is pure, raw sensual. I mean it borders on erotic it's so strong. \n\nDuring \"Past the point of no return\" I'm sitting there with my wife, literally falling under the spell myself. \"Yea... maybe she *should* be with this guy after all...\" But that's the whole point. She WAS influenced by him, and he did cast a strong spell, and he was very alluring. The movie made it so real I was beginning to feel it myself. \n\nSome people have derided Gerard Butler's performance. Frankly, I find his throaty, sometimes raspy voice to be right on par. I heard so much ado about Michael Crawford that I went to Amazon and listened to some of his renditions of these songs. Verdict: Give me Gerard Butler! His voice is masculine, seductive, and hypnotic. In the final verdict, I find the movie versions of these songs to be FAR superiour to the Broadway versions. I say \"Bravo!\" to the selection of Gerard.\n\nDefinitely worth seeing in a theatre if you can. Don't wait for the DVD. See it BIG and LOUD. \n\nMy favs: Masquerade! \"All I ask of you,\" and \"Point of No Return.\" \n\nWow... Point of no return had ME believing!!!!\n\nWhat raging passion floods the soul,\n\nwhat rich desire unlocks its door,\n\nwhat sweet seduction lies before us, ...past the point of no return...\n\nOh yeah, that's the stuff!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H23M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Phantom of the Opera", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1082130713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRlYTM1NjktYWU5Yi00NmRlLWIzYWYtOWUyMmU0YzE0Njg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRlYTM1NjktYWU5Yi00NmRlLWIzYWYtOWUyMmU0YzE0Njg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:39:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124930/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gerard Butler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0124930?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "The Phantom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0933940/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Patrick Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0933940?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Raoul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000378/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Minnie Driver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0000378?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Carlotta"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001003/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Simon Callow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0001003?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Andre"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0255204/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jennifer Ellison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0255204?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Meg Giry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0573618/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kevin McNally"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0573618?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Buquet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0047712/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Imogen Bain"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0047712?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Carlotta's Maid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0661585/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Judith Paris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0661585?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Carlotta's Seamstress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002536/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Emmy Rossum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0002536?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001669/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Miranda Richardson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0001669?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Madame Giry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001354/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ciar\u00e1n Hinds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0001354?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Firmin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0570302/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Victor McGuire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0570302?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Piangi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0578527/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Murray Melvin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0578527?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Reyer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0281424/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "James Fleet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm0281424?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lefevre"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1528697/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Miles Western"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0293508/characters/nm1528697?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Carlotta's Wigmaker"}]}]}

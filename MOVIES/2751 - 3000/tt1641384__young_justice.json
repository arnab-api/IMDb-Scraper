These days, if a series shows quality, it is because it was taken seriously by high- ranked people. I love the tone, the characters, the plot-line, the themes, the secrets, the chemistry between many characters, the relationship between Justice League (mentors) and Young Justice (sidekicks), the way they make superheroes used to be forgettable now memorable, etc. I absolutely didn't care about Superboy, Speedy, Blue Beetle, etc., but now I really am interested and I think that is the strength of this show.\n\nThe only tiny, small and little complaint I have concerns the music. Actually, I love how it is played throughout each episode, but to make it truly epic, it needs a better introduction or a standout song just like ''The Batman'' (90s, ''Superman'' (90s) and both ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited'' : Tananan! Tananan! Tananananan! ... Of course, it is only a personal opinion and it certainly does not diminish the quality of this show.\n\nI have watched the entire ''Young Justice'' season 1 and everything that has aired of season 2 in the last four days and whaouh! I want more and more and more. Whe I started watching season 2, I was utterly surprised to see a 5 years jump from where season 1 left and CHUCK NORRIS or GOD was I pleased! It truly is an intelligent move because it allows to bring new young superheroes like Blue Beetle or Impulse, etc. I am 20 years old and this show certainly is for young teenagers and young adults and even adults. Many theme are for mature people, with life and death decisions.\n\nI can't believe how great the animation is, almost as great as every single DC animated movie they release each year, last one being ''The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1''. I truly hope they'll continue this series for many years to come because it is AMAZINGLY AWESOME! This series take risks and it works just fine in my book. That is what keeps it fresh. However, I hope they stay focus on the main characters they developed in the first season, not making the same mistake of some episodes of ''Justice League Unlimited''.\n\nI can only give it a minimum of 9.5/10, but IMDb approximates, so to me, it is a 10/10! If any of the designers see this review, I encourage your awesome work and make you know that you have my total admiration. I was searching for a good show and I found yours by total luck. I am not very lucky in my life, but I think, that day, I totally was!\n\nTHANK YOU ;)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Young Justice: Season One, Volume Three", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3933314585", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q0YzBkM2UtMjEzOC00YjA4LWIxMzUtZDM4N2Y5NjJjZjJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q0YzBkM2UtMjEzOC00YjA4LWIxMzUtZDM4N2Y5NjJjZjJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Young Justice: Season One, Volume Three", "uploadDate": "2011-12-01T06:43:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0565366/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jesse McCartney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm0565366?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dick Grayson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "57 episodes, 2010-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0636046/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nolan North"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm0636046?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Conner Kent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "56 episodes, 2010-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1107254/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stephanie Lemelin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm1107254?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Artemis Crock"}, {"url": "#", "name": "53 episodes, 2010-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339304/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bruce Greenwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm0339304?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bruce Wayne"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2010-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3469812/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Zehra Fazal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm3469812?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Violet Harper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1684869/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Troy Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm1684869?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brion Markov"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005211/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Danica McKellar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm0005211?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Miss Martian"}, {"url": "#", "name": "57 episodes, 2010-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1146051/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Khary Payton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm1146051?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kaldur'ahm"}, {"url": "#", "name": "54 episodes, 2010-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1032853/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jason Spisak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm1032853?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Wally West"}, {"url": "#", "name": "43 episodes, 2010-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0293342/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Crispin Freeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm0293342?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Roy Harper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "27 episodes, 2010-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0556089/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Masasa Moyo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1641384/characters/nm0556089?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cat Grant"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2011-2019"}]}]}

It is a great balance of comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously or become too stupid. It is not as depressing as \"Girls\", and not as clich\u00e9 as \"2 Broke Girls\". Loved it! Not only did I fall in love with Abbi and Ilana's characters right away, but Hannibal Buress plays his role perfectly. Laughed out loud the whole time. If you get a chance, check out their short youtube clips of their webisodes. It's nice to see a show made with female comedians that are unknown.

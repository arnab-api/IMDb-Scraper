The characters are funny and the writing is really well done. You have to judge it on a \"sitcom\" scale and in that spectrum this show is very high quality. It can get clich\u00e9 sometimes but that is to be expected.\n\nNow for my only complaint...It's too preachy!!! I'm all for political statements here and there but this show is chalked full of them. Even if I agree with most of the political statements covered, it still comes across as very elitist with constant lecturing. To the point where one of the white male characters is on the show only so the entire cast can preach to him and put him in his place all the time. Are there men like this? Of course, a lot actually. But for some white men this show can be pretty insulting.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who can handle politics ingrained in your entertainment, then go for it! It's a really good show worth watching. If you are the kind of person who is looking for an escape from the constant politics engulfing our country right now and just want some laughs, I don't recommend this show. But that shouldn't take completely away from the quality of the show which is very good.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3: Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi303151641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4OGNkYTAtMjFkZS00YmNiLTg5OWMtYWRkNDc5MDAzZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4OGNkYTAtMjFkZS00YmNiLTg5OWMtYWRkNDc5MDAzZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Alvarez family returns for Season 3 on Feb. 8.", "uploadDate": "2019-01-10T15:00:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532461/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Justina Machado"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5339440/characters/nm0532461?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Penelope Alvarez"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4905066/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Isabella Gomez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5339440/characters/nm4905066?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elena Alvarez"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0864997/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stephen Tobolowsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5339440/characters/nm0864997?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. Leslie Berkowitz"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1758989/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Todd Grinnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5339440/characters/nm1758989?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Schneider"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8180159/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Marcel Ruiz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5339440/characters/nm8180159?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alex Alvarez"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001549/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rita Moreno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5339440/characters/nm0001549?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lydia Riera"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}]}

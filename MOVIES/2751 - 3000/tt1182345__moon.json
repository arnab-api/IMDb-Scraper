There wasn't an empty seat in the  1300-capacity palace. Directed by Duncan Jones, \"Moon\" stars Sam  Rockwell, one of our generation's most powerful actors.  The notion of a film being unique seems unlikely in 2009. Not here.  While \"Moon\" is a modern-day science fiction film set in the future, it  pays homage to recent classics like \"Blade Runner\" and \"Alien.\" Viewers  will be dazzled -- fans of the genre will nod in approval.  Science has developed a way to mine the rocks of the moon for clean  energy here on earth. Private enterprise, in the form of a corporation, sends astronauts on a three-year work stint to carry out  this ongoing mission. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the latest to undertake  this task, with the trusted robot GERTY by his side watching over the  base's operations -- think HAL with a heart. Of course, things are not  what they seem, and the viewer is mesmerized as puzzling and surprising  events unfold.  Cinematographer Gary Shaw contributes to the impression of the eerie  stillness of life on the moon with the copious use of still camera and  slow tracking shots, only using hand-held when necessary. Nicolas  Gaster's editing is sure and steady, emphasizing the slow pace of Sam  Bell's multi-year work assignment. Remember those pre-CGI days when  special effects meant miniature land rovers on a bumpy table? It can  still be done -- and be believable. \"Moon\" is evocative of the sci-fi  greats whose visuals were done in-camera, i.e., on set as opposed to  being created by computers in post-production. Sam Bell's unearthly  home is comfortable yet aging like the patina of an old cottage.  Nathan Parker's screenplay (Jones wrote the story but handed over  screen writing duties to Parker) makes the most of Sam Rockwell's  considerable talents. This was quite a physically demanding role, as  well, and rarely has the actor been better (watch \"Snow Angels,\"  though). He doesn't just carry the film -- \"Moon\" is almost a one-man  show and Rockwell conducts a master class.  \"Moon\" is a classic, down and dirty (literally) science fiction film  with a baffling mystery that challenges the viewer to live in the shoes  of the protagonist. It's hard to imagine a better one than Sam Rockwell  or a more effective, entertaining, and satisfying cinematic experience.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Moon", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1265108249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhhNzE4NjEtMGIyZC00MDBiLTk0ZGMtY2ZhNjFkMWEwN2VkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhhNzE4NjEtMGIyZC00MDBiLTk0ZGMtY2ZhNjFkMWEwN2VkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this sci-fi movie", "uploadDate": "2009-11-08T06:24:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005377/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sam Rockwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm0005377?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sam Bell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1069800/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dominique McElligott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm1069800?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tess Bell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3668631/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Adrienne Shaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm3668631?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nanny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0938950/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Benedict Wong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm0938950?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829121/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Malcolm Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm0829121?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Technician"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000228/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kevin Spacey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm0000228?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "GERTY"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3675884/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rosie Shaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm3675884?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Little Eve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2546012/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kaya Scodelario"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm2546012?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Eve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1546196/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Matt Berry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm1546196?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Overmeyers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2933135/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Robin Chalk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1182345/characters/nm2933135?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sam Bell Clone"}]}]}

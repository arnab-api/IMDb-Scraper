I had been holding off though as my Dad came out as transgender about 2.5 years ago and was worried how I would react to it. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed the series but there were conversations that were almost word for word the same as one's I had when I first found out about my Dad and I did end up in tears at points remembering how hard it all seemed at the time.\n\nI think the series perfectly shows how you start questioning your life when you discover something major about your parents that you never could have guessed but may have felt things weren't quite as they seemed. I know I definitely felt my Dad had been hiding something for years before I found out but never suspected it was wanting to be a woman.\n\nThe acting is fantastic in this series and the story is definitely an aspect of life that most people haven't had much contact with or know much about but does seem to be something more people are willing to share and make people more aware of.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Teaser Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3637230617", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI5NDVmNjYtMmIzMy00MjYzLTk1OTEtZDMxNTA0ZTRkZjlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI5NDVmNjYtMmIzMy00MjYzLTk1OTEtZDMxNTA0ZTRkZjlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "THE TRANSPARENT MUSICALE FINALE is coming this Fall.

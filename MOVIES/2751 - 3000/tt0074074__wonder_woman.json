The first season takes place in the 1940s with Wonder Woman constantly fighting to dismantle the Nazi's schemes. The following two seasons take place in the 1970s, and they will be released on DVD soon.\n\nThe show is always bordering on the level of high camp, but like most every show from the 1970s, it tells its' story in a very plain straightforward fashion. Wonder Woman comes to the aid of Steve Trevor, who can never seem to help himself (the male in distress). Someone they know turns out to be an undercover Nazi spy, who is trying to steal valuable information or hurt many Americans.\n\nOne thing that is somewhat frustrating is how many times she is taken captured. She is chloroformed too many times to count (a 70s trademark - what action show didn't over-exploit chloroform?) Of course, how the hell does Steve never recognize that Diana is Wonder Woman, even when she happens to show up in the middle of Brazil to save him? And that music while she flies the invisible airplane?...yeeeeeaassh!\n\nThe good parts of the show - Lynda Carter, first of all. She seemed to hit her stride in the part as the series continued and she is often so charming and innocent that you can't help but like her. Her values and strength of character are idealistic, but they're also missing in today's female heroes, who are so dark sometimes, they lose their charm. In many ways, watching Lynda as Wonder Woman is a breath of fresh air and of course, there still doesn't seem to be a woman other than her who could wear that outfit and pull it off. When Wonder Woman first walks on the city streets in the pilot, you don't know what to think, but Lynda plays her so innocently she's fantastic.\n\nShe is the driving force, but the innocent quality of the show (good vs. bad) is unique from today's perspective. The comic book captions at the leads of scenes give it a tie to the comics. The guest stars are often interesting and have good roles and Lyle Waggoner is consistent in a rather thankless role as Steve Trevor.\n\nIt may not hold up perfectly today, but it's a nice time capsule series and Lynda Carter does hold up well in a role she was born to play. And along with the Hulk, this was the best of the slew of comic book hero shows from the 1970s-early 80s.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "MeTV Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3484074265", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMzNzRlMjctYjc0ZC00NjdiLTliZWUtMjcxY2ZhNzg1ZmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMzNzRlMjctYjc0ZC00NjdiLTliZWUtMjcxY2ZhNzg1ZmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The adventures of the greatest of the female superheroes.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-22T11:05:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004812/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lynda Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074074/characters/nm0004812?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Diana Prince"}, {"url": "#", "name": "60 episodes, 1975-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0905741/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lyle Waggoner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074074/characters/nm0905741?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Colonel Steve Trevor, Jr."}, {"url": "#", "name": "59 episodes, 1975-1979"}]}]}

Their pilot episode was bound to hook people. Mission Impossible was a winner from the start.\n\nThe Impossible Missions Force were a team of agents with no emotional attachments who went on secret missions usually against organized crime or rogue nations. They did not go in and use guns or fists to fight a problem-the name of the game was manipulation, deception, trickery, fraud, you name it. The agents were in fact anti-heroes who stooped to the level of the bad guys themselves. But I still loved them for it.\n\nIt would be unfair to reveal any of the intricate details of the plots for the series but let's just say they were clever. Mission Impossible was a show that required a viewer's full attention-you simply couldn't switch onto an episode halfway through and expect to know what's going on. Mission Impossible was clever throughout it's entire run. The IMF always had a plan which had to be strictly adhered to for it to be a success. They used every mean trick in the book to bring the bad guys down and they always slipped away at the end without the bad guys ever finding out who they were. In fact, quite a few episodes involved the bad guys falling out with each other after believing the other one was out to get him when in fact it was the IMF who had set it all up.\n\nA clever show indeed-highly recommended."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "MeTV Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2796208409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2MWJmMzctNjhiMy00ZWExLWIzMzEtMmRhNmI4NGM3ZjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjY2MWJmMzctNjhiMy00ZWExLWIzMzEtMmRhNmI4NGM3ZjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An elite covert operations unit carries out highly sensitive missions subject to official denial in the event of failure, death or capture.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-22T09:10:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0606569/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Greg Morris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0060009/characters/nm0606569?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Barney Collier"}, {"url": "#", "name": "171 episodes, 1966-1973"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0336335/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter Graves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0060009/characters/nm0336335?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Phelps"}, {"url": "#", "name": "143 episodes, 1967-1973"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001445/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Martin Landau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0060009/characters/nm0001445?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rollin Hand"}, {"url": "#", "name": "76 episodes, 1966-1969"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0527032/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Peter Lupus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0060009/characters/nm0527032?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Willy Armitage"}, {"url": "#", "name": "161 episodes, 1966-1973"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000828/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Barbara Bain"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0060009/characters/nm0000828?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cinnamon Carter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 1966-1969"}]}]}

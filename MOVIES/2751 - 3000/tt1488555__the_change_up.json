Hilarious. Much MUCH better than I expected. Of course, this is the type of film better seen with a filled theater.\n\nOf course it's a hard 'R' for vulgarity, nudity, and everything you expect in a sex-themed comedy. The trailers don't shy away from that.\n\nOne always expects great comedic timing from the likes of Reynolds and Bateman. However, in these roles they truly do something different. Bateman gets to be the raunchy one. He finally gets to let loose. Reynolds holds back as the straight-laced guy who's more of a thinker.\n\nLeslie Mann was the true surprise in the film. I hope Judd Apatow watches this \"The Change-Up\" and realizes one thing; THIS is how you write for/use your wife in your films. Leslie can act! She takes the otherwise tiresome 'wife' role and turns it into something a little deeper.\n\nOlivia Wilde plays the unfortunate part of 'that girl.' She's not there to serve much purpose throughout the flick, but her story is summed up nicely. But sweet merciful GOD does she look fantastic with very dark hair! Anyway, it's a great flick. I suggest you go see it, you'll enjoy it. It's not your typical \"body swap\" movie (ala \"Freaky Friday,\" \"Vice Versa,\" \"Like Father, Like Son.\") plus I believe it has more heart than any of those three.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Change-Up: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1232313625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTAwOTU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjAwNTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTAwOTU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjAwNTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A comedy centered on two guys -- a married man and a committed bachelor - who switch bodies after a night of drinking.", "uploadDate": "2011-05-12T11:32:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005351/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mitch Planko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005182/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Leslie Mann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0005182?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jamie Lockwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000273/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alan Arkin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0000273?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mitch's Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411857/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gregory Itzin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0411857?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Flemming Steel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0591247/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ming Lo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0591247?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ken Kinkabe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0081572/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Craig Bierko"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0081572?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Valtan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3244413/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Andrea Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm3244413?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sophia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640173/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Taaffe O'Connell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0640173?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mona"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000867/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jason Bateman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0000867?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dave Lockwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1312575/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Olivia Wilde"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm1312575?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sabrina McKay"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1597260/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mircea Monroe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm1597260?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tatiana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0773307/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ned Schmidtke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0773307?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ted Norton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3437020/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sydney Rouviere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm3437020?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cara Lockwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0341159/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dax Griffin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm0341159?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Blow-Dried Goon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1494966/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Matthew Cornwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1488555/characters/nm1494966?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Parks Foreman"}]}]}

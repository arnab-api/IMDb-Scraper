I just want to direct you to the writer and creator Joseph Mallozi's blog to read why it was cancelled and wasn't saved, which demonstrates once again the haughtiness of \"money making moguls\" in networks deciding that we, the viewers, are just bottom lines and they're just milking the milky way however fast they can. Disrespecting loyal fans is no longer a tenable posture in the industry, especially when dozens of awful shows get produced that don't have the level of quality this one had, especially in the sci-fi genre and on SYFY. Besides The Expanse, there wasn't much being done towards giving sci-fi afficionaos the real deal. Personnaly, I believe in the downfall of the $ all-mighty culture of the entertainment industry that disregards viewers' choices especially when they're loyal to the series. We too can unite and fund movies-series outside the realm of the establishment if need be. It's about time WE decide not the networks.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2707599641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTQwMjc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0NjMzNTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTQwMjc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0NjMzNTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the trailer for Syfy's \"Dark Matter.\"", "uploadDate": "2015-04-15T14:03:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2047780/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Melissa O'Neil"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4159076/characters/nm2047780?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Two"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2015-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3520506/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alex Mallari Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4159076/characters/nm3520506?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Four"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2015-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003078/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Roger Cross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4159076/characters/nm0003078?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Six"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2015-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2544244/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Marc Bendavid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4159076/characters/nm2544244?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "One"}, {"url": "#", "name": "16 episodes, 2015-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0501355/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Anthony Lemke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4159076/characters/nm0501355?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Three"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2015-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272706/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jodelle Ferland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4159076/characters/nm0272706?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Five"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2015-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1235776/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Zoie Palmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4159076/characters/nm1235776?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "The Android"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2015-2017"}]}]}

So the other night I was channel-surfing for something good to watch, and there it was about to start on SHO. I decided to tune in.\n\nNo point in introducing the film's plot, which everyone knows. So let me just add a couple of general observations. First, I was surprised how good the film actually was. I'm not sure where I had gotten the idea in my head that this probably wasn't going to be all that good, but it is an intense, very intense, stalker-drama. Second, the three lead performances are rock solid, led by a believable crazy-over-the-top Glenn Close. Her transformation from lover to stalker to hater is absolutely spine-tingling. Third, the movie of course feels a bit dated when you see not a single communication exchange on mobile devices. Instead, old landline phones actually ring out loud. No texting of course. Fourth, after watching this the other night, I read up a bit on the movie's history and legacy, and it was then that I learned that the movie's original ending was changed drastically into what we now know as the ending. The original ending sounds sounds more logical to me that what it eventually would become, although I can certainly see the shock value in the new ending.\n\nBottom line, this movie was a pleasant surprise all around, and these 2 hours just flew by. Glad that I finally joined the rest of the cinema-loving crowd and now have seen \"Fatal Attraction\", 33 years after the facts. If you are one of those who like me hadn't seen this yet. I'd readily suggest you check it out and draw your own conclusion.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fatal Attraction", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1793768985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYyODI4MWUtZDViNC00OWUzLTk0NzEtMjAyM2E4MzUwMmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYyODI4MWUtZDViNC00OWUzLTk0NzEtMjAyM2E4MzUwMmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-04-29T17:02:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000140/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Douglas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0000140?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dan Gallagher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000271/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anne Archer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0000271?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Beth Gallagher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0659573/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stuart Pankin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0659573?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jimmy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001304/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Fred Gwynne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0001304?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Arthur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0107419/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tom Brennan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0107419?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Howard Rogerson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0638276/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mike Nussbaum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0638276?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bob Drimmer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035080/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michael Arkin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0035080?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lieutenant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0696694/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Eunice Prewitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0696694?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Receptionist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000335/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Glenn Close"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0000335?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alex Forrest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0490477/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ellen Latzen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0490477?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ellen Gallagher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0284129/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ellen Foley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0284129?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hildy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0612778/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Meg Mundy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0612778?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joan Rogerson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809135/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lois Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093010/characters/nm0809135?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Martha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0426666/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "J.J.

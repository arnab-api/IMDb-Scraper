Torchwood is, at the very least, an imaginative, well-acted, well-photographed and, more than anything, totally idiosyncratic series.\n\nMany seem put off by the sex. Fortunately, that wasn't a problem for the show's writers. This is a series that neither glories in nor shies away from sex. Characters have believable sex lives, that affect their actions in realistic ways. Some episodes are frankly *about* sex, in a brilliantly science-fictional way. (Bear in mind, the series is very definitely *not* aimed at kids. These characters are adults, and the show is written for adults. That in itself is pretty refreshing!)\n\nSome of the interactions may border on soap opera... but that's the format. It works. It's an ensemble show, and it's about how the private lives of relatively normal humans are transformed by extraordinary events. No, these characters aren't as cute and lovable as, say, the crew of the Serenity. They're thorny, often irrational. I love that about them. Like real people, they often act in ways that even their best friends can't predict. And as with real people, one develops an affection for their faults as much as their virtues.\n\nStories are clever, but not cerebral. This isn't Twilight Zone. It's not 'hard' Science Fiction. It's a 'pulp' show for adults who want to feel like kids for an hour. It creates a world where the bizarre is commonplace. The viewpoint character is a 'normal' policewoman... she moves into this strange world, adapting to its superhuman challenges and becoming addicted to its heady rewards. It's a highly involving formula... if you're the sort of viewer who often finds our 'real' world far too dull and predictable.\n\nLike Doctor Who, Torchwood is a show that, on paper, shouldn't really work. At every point in Doctor Who's long, long run, nay-sayers have proved with inescapable logic that it can't possibly work: it's too violent, it's too dark, it's too silly, it's too intellectual... it's too expensive. Many of the criticisms have been mutually contradictory! The same seems to be true of Torchwood... it's an odd, angular beast, that doesn't really follow any established paradigm. Saying it's \"like Angel,\" or \"like the X-Files\" really isn't very revealing. In SOME ways, it's like Gunsmoke. Or Bless This House.\n\nI won't give Torchwood a 10/10. Yet. It could be tighter... I have the feeling the first season meandered just a bit. But considering the oddly discordant tone it's trying to hit, that's hardly surprising. It would be even more surprising if the show was able to attract more than a cult following. What does seem ironic is that the cult followings of other, genetically-similar shows such as Doctor Who seem largely unable to appreciate this one. Sci-fi and fantasy used to be about shedding one's preconceptions... now they're cults with preconceptions of their own.\n\nTo me, that only adds to the attraction. Torchwood isn't 'like' Doctor Who, or any previous show, in tone, style, pace or perspective. But it has the same essence... the same willingness to take chances, to forge a new myth unlike any other that's gone before. Even if it stumbles a bit at the start, I can't wait to see where it's going.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Torchwood: Children of Earth", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3363963417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NzE4NTQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NzE4NTQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIwMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In an epic story told over five nights, the new series to be broadcast on BBC America (U.S.) in July promises to be Torchwood's most enthralling adventure yet.", "uploadDate": "2009-05-30T05:14:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0057882/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Barrowman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0485301/characters/nm0057882?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain Jack Harkness"}, {"url": "#", "name": "41 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1544523/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kai Owen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0485301/characters/nm1544523?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rhys Williams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "34 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1218607/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Burn Gorman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0485301/characters/nm1218607?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Owen Harper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2006-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0616990/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eve Myles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0485301/characters/nm0616990?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gwen Cooper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "41 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1496173/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gareth David-Lloyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0485301/characters/nm1496173?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ianto Jones"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2006-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0605283/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Naoko Mori"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0485301/characters/nm0605283?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Toshiko Sato"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2006-2008"}]}]}

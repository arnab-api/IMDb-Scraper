This sequel (beyond letting us know the people behind these movies are obviously trying to make a working franchise) tells us how hard it is to duplicate success on those rare instances where a science fiction movie breaks the mold and follow it up with something just as good or better. It's a weird trait that many sequels to successful movies succumb to, but then again, when the original does so many things right some level of disappointment or failings seem almost guaranteed. Dreary atmosphere, a workable story, sprinkles of dark humor, satisfying action pieces and some real emotion. The original had it all. It'd be a fantasy to think we were going to get this and more in a sequel.\n\nWe don't. This outing finds less of the dark humor and less of Murphy's humanity as he's tasked with going up against a new underground drug taking over New Detroit. Of course, things will come to a violent head and once again it will be Robocop's prime directive to make things right. Tom Noonan, who starts as the main villain is perhaps the best and the worse. A good actor can take an underwritten part farther than it was supposed to go, but only so far. Hence a key problem. Like most drug barons, especially in movie land, the one he plays is paranoid and prone to using violence. Which means the pursuit of clich\u00e9 set pieces and scenarios like an obvious showdown between him and Robocop before the end (in some form). What maybe you don't expect is when half-way through the movie, the main villainy force becomes a 14 year old successor to a drug empire.\n\nThe premise is simple enough. Part man, mostly machine. He's not prone to annoyances normal human beings have to deal with like being shot, bleeding, dying... that sort of thing. He can be as detached from the world as he wants to be because let's face it, he is detached. Peter Weller reprises as Robocop. Nancy Allen is again along for the ride as his partner. OCP is still OCP. The headquarters for a faceless mega corporation built on greed. Those things haven't changed, but other more intimate story and atmosphere elements have.\n\nRobocop 2 ends up not being a horrible outing. It is still very much entertaining and in due part to memories established by the original, but give me back more of that dark trashy New Detroit atmosphere as seen in the original. Give me less throwaway action scenes, 14-year old boy villains and mediocre stop motion effects. Most of all give me back the feeling that Robocop was fresh. I know that's hard to fulfill, but at least give me a glimmer of hope.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "RoboCop 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3902979865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Y5ODZlZTMtYTQ0OC00NGRlLWI2NDktOWY3NjljZTE4ZWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Y5ODZlZTMtYTQ0OC00NGRlLWI2NDktOWY3NjljZTE4ZWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2019-09-05T17:05:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000693/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Weller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0100502/characters/nm0000693?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robocop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000873/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Belinda Bauer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0100502/characters/nm0000873?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Juliette Faxx"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0675066/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Felton Perry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0100502/characters/nm0675066?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Donald Johnson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0700072/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Willard E.

In meeting a 20 year old girl, Jeanne, played by Maria Schneider, in an empty apartment, Paul hopes to form a relationship purely on his own terms and at his own pace, i.e. one he can understand fully. He insists on a new form of relationship, so basic that even their names were kept secret from each other, where she submitted to his every desire, where he could punish himself and relieve his despair and anger towards his wife by punishing Jeanne. Paul's only other interest is in Marcel (Massimo Girotti), Rosa's lover, for whom he has a curious respect and maybe a desire to obtain through him a better understanding of his own wife.\n\n Despite his overpowering talent, Marlon Brando has often shown poor judgement in his choice of projects and has frequently trudged through films with no apparent effort or interest. In 'Last Tango in Paris' he gives everything and produces a performance of unrivalled force. Unfortunately the obvious improvisation in the film prevents the character of Paul from staying within check as he gradually becomes too much like Marlon Brando in the second half of the film. Nonetheless, when Brando is off-screen the film becomes hollow in comparison and is replaced by Jeanne's relationship with her fiance, an annoyingly pretentious TV director (Jean-Pierre Leaud).\n\n This is a truly unique film and Bertolucci successfully highlights the romance in an affair that is fundamentally destructive. Brando's performance is remarkably powerful and intense, eclipsing every other player and dominating the entire film."}, "duration": "PT2H9M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Last Tango in Paris", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2392129817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJlMzk0NjAtZWM1OS00NDUyLWE2ZGMtYzgyMTlmZmZhOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJlMzk0NjAtZWM1OS00NDUyLWE2ZGMtYzgyMTlmZmZhOTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:58:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Marlon Brando"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0000008?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0585170/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Maria Michi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0585170?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rosa's Mother"}, {"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0585170?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "La m\u00e8re de Rosa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0536507/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gitt Magrini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0536507?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jeanne's Mother"}, {"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0536507?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "La m\u00e8re de Jeanne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0549656/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Luce Marquand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0549656?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Olympia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0106924/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Catherine Breillat"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0106924?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mouchette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0812568/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Catherine Sola"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0812568?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "TV Script Girl"}, {"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0812568?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "La script-girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0529543/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0529543?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tom - un cin\u00e9aste, le fianc\u00e9 de Jeanne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0774731/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Peter Schommer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0774731?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "TV Assistant Cameraman"}, {"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0774731?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "L'assistant-op\u00e9rateur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0773932/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maria Schneider"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0773932?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeanne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0302815/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Giovanna Galletti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0302815?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Prostitute"}, {"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0302815?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "La prostitu\u00e9e"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0021691/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Catherine All\u00e9gret"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0021691?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Catherine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0106925/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Breillat"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0106925?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Monique"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0224576/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dan Diament"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0224576?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "TV Sound Engineer"}, {"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0224576?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "L'ing\u00e9nieur du son"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0545578/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mauro Marchetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0545578?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "TV Cameraman"}, {"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0545578?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Le cameraman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0320988/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Massimo Girotti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070849/characters/nm0320988?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Marcel"}]}]}

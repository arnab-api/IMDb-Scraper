I liked the plot and it had plenty of twists and turns. It is quite suspenseful in places and keeps you guessing. It is about a bank robbery (the masks here were quite cool) that goes wrong and the two have to team up to put it right.\n\nThe acting is very good. Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington were a very good team, they had a good on screen chemistry and I liked how their friendship developed. The supporting cast were also good.\n\nThe film is a mixture of action and comedy. There are good shoot out scenes and car chases etc. Then there is comedy thrown in for good measure, made even funnier because it's silly humour in a serious situation. Mark Wahlberg's character has some memorable funny moments and both do the action scenes very well.\n\nOverall it was a good fast paced action film, it had suspense and humour too. A really good mixture. At 1 hour and 35 minutes I felt it was a good length, you got everything you wanted out of it and it wasn't dragged on like some other films would. I enjoyed it from start to finish and would recommend it.\n\n8/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1587915033", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3MDYwODIxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMyNTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3MDYwODIxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMyNTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A DEA agent and an undercover Naval Intelligence officer who have been tasked with investigating one another find they have been set up by the mob -- the very organization the two men believe they have been stealing money from.", "uploadDate": "2013-06-27T07:16:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000243/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Denzel Washington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm0000243?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bobby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1745736/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paula Patton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm1745736?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Deb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000200/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bill Paxton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm0000200?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Earl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005188/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "James Marsden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm0005188?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Quince"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0911542/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Fred Ward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm0911542?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Admiral Tuwey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3998145/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Derek Solorsano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm3998145?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ferret Nose Julio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2356797/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kyle Clements"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm2356797?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Teemo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1419241/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tim Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm1419241?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Lean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000242/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mark Wahlberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm0000242?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stig"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001579/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Edward James Olmos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm0001579?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Papi Greco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121559/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Robert John Burke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm0121559?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jessup"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1829945/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Greg Sproles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm1829945?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Chief Lucas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0279209/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Patrick Fischler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm0279209?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dr. Ken"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1598758/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Edgar Arreola"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm1598758?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rudy (Papi's Men)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4232922/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Christopher Matthew Cook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1272878/characters/nm4232922?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Thick"}]}]}

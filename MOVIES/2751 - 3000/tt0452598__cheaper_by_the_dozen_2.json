Come on man!", "reviewBody": "My Take: Trite, predictable family diversion. \n\nAfter having dismissing it as a simple-minded family picture for many times, I gave CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN, a very loose adaptation of a novel by Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, a try and it turned out to be a surprise delight. It wasn't perfect, maybe not even formula, but I was delighted by it. It was a lot of fun and it never seemed to run our of energy, especially for the always funny Steve Martin. Martin is back in this sequel, and so is much of the same cast, Bonnie Hunt in particular. Joining the original cast is a new set of players including American PIE regular Eugene Levy, parody-movie regular Carmen Electra and another batch of kids and teens. This is CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2, and if I was wrong about the first film, I was more wrong to think this one will be better.\n\nIn this sequel, the family that couldn't get along leaves all their indifference behind a long time ago. Now their one big, happy family. While going on a camping vacation (as usual, they have to live inside a rotten, old cabin), they get into some competition with dad Tom Baker's (Martin) old rival Jimmy Murtaugh (Levy) and his family, composed of sexy wife Sarina (Electra) and eight children. See Murtaugh is athletic and daring while Tom only wishes that his kids (jealous as always) would have a better vacation. So on goes a series of challenges and competitions they go through, fighting for who gets the better summer this year.\n\nUnfortunately, it might have not been the audience. Having missed it on the big screen, I caught CHEAPER 2 on TV and, since I wasn't really anticipating anything (a sequel to CHEAPER is nothing big to get excited about). That probably helps to be able to enjoy a movie like this. But while lowering your expectations might help at being kind to your response to it, that doesn't necessarily mean liking it. Martin and Levy (funny men, by the way) are at their best efforts, as Hunt playing responsible mother Kate, but they can't shine in a script than limits what they can do. Kids, as usual, will drag you to the video store to rent or buy it, and maybe you should. But don't be surprised if you won't like it. It really isn't made for you.\n\nRating: ** out of 5.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Cheaper by the Dozen 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi62783769", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxODAxNGUtNTEzYy00MTI0LThkZjMtNzg1ODA5ODZjNWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxODAxNGUtNTEzYy00MTI0LThkZjMtNzg1ODA5ODZjNWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:21:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000188/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452598/characters/nm0000188?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Baker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001372/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bonnie Hunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452598/characters/nm0001372?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kate Baker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005305/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Piper Perabo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452598/characters/nm0005305?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nora Baker-McNulty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0454809/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jaime King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452598/characters/nm0454809?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Anne Murtaugh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1210124/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Taylor Lautner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452598/characters/nm1210124?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eliot Murtaugh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1057932/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jonathan Bennett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452598/characters/nm1057932?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bud McNulty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1137414/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Liliana Mumy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452598/characters/nm1137414?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jessica Baker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0773056/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kevin G.

The couple would make the decision to use each, one would fall for the other, and in the end they would live happily ever after. I was correct about the overall story line, but, impressively, the writers found a way the mix in enough comedy to keep you entertained for the full 110 minutes. On top of that, there is enough cutsie romance to make for the perfect date night movie. Comedy to make you laugh and romance to cheer up any romantic girl.... sounds like a romantic comedy to me!\n\nNatalie Portman shows her range of acting abilities by having two extremely different films in theaters at the same time. I was thoroughly impressed with her ability to drop the comedic one liners and portray a unaffectionate woman who's fallen in love realistically. Comparing this to her award-winning role in Black Swan made her abilities even more impressive. I cannot say the same for Ashton Kutcher. He has a great face and is great at comedic acting. However, each serious, romantic scene he was in became unrealistic and uncomfortable. \n\nOverall, this is the perfect date night or girls night movie. It has some great comedic moments and brings in the romance that most ladies love to see. If you are looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy, this is a great choice.\n\nSee more reviews at http://burningreview.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No Strings Attached", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1902549273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4NDQ3MzUyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk5MjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4NDQ3MzUyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk5MjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A guy and girl try to keep their relationship strictly physical, but it's not long before they learn that they want something more.", "uploadDate": "2010-11-06T12:41:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000204/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Natalie Portman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm0000204?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000177/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin Kline"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm0000177?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alvin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1950086/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Greta Gerwig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm1950086?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patrice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1880888/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Olivia Thirlby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm1880888?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Katie Kurtzman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2159926/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jake Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm2159926?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eli"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0051104/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Talia Balsam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm0051104?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sandra Kurtzman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1502218/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Guy Branum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm1502218?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0410400/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jennifer Irwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm0410400?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Megan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005110/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ashton Kutcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm0005110?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Adam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000144/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cary Elwes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm0000144?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Metzner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1128572/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lake Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm1128572?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lucy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0524839/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ludacris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm0524839?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wallace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1411676/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mindy Kaling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm1411676?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shira"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1166041/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ophelia Lovibond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm1166041?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Vanessa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0493159/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ben Lawson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1411238/characters/nm0493159?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sam"}]}]}

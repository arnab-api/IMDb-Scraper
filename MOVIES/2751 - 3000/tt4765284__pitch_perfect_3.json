First, since when did this become a Rebel Wilson movie? It was all about her. I don't mind Rebel Wilson in small doses but I'm not a huge fan and frankly, as much as I love the movies, I don't particularly enjoy her part in them. I am Australian and I actually find her sense of humour distasteful. She's not funny. Second, I did not like the way that Rebel Wilson's character, Amy, belittled Haillee Steinfeld's character, Emily. Quite simply, it showed to the world that it's okay to bully someone. And it wasn't just once, it was quite a few times. This is not a criticism of Rebel Wilson but a huge criticism of the writers/director as it leaves me wondering what on earth was going through their minds when they okayed those lines in the movie. Anyway, apart from that, it wasn't too bad but definitely not as good as the first two. I will say that the ending was was great and so was the song they chose, Freedom.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi291551513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNkZDYyOGYtYTVlZi00YTdkLTk4MDUtMjg4ZGFjZTFhNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNkZDYyOGYtYTVlZi00YTdkLTk4MDUtMjg4ZGFjZTFhNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Following their win at the world championship, the now separated Bellas reunite for one last singing competition at an overseas USO tour, but face a group who uses both instruments and voices.", "uploadDate": "2017-09-25T15:04:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447695/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Anna Kendrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm0447695?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Beca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0811242/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brittany Snow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm0811242?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chloe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2794962/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hailee Steinfeld"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm2794962?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2443438/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hana Mae Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm2443438?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lilly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4708985/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Shelley Regner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm4708985?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ashley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006969/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Elizabeth Banks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm0006969?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gail"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001475/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Lithgow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm0001475?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fergus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1298458/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Guy Burnet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm1298458?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Theo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2313103/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rebel Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm2313103?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Fat Amy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2319871/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anna Camp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm2319871?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aubrey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3637636/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ester Dean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm3637636?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cynthia Rose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4275908/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kelley Jakle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm4275908?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jessica"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2610425/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chrissie Fit"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm2610425?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Flo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383422/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Michael Higgins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm0383422?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1782667/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Matt Lanter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4765284/characters/nm1782667?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Chicago"}]}]}

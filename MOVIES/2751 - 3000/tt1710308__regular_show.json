I feel like I shouldn't even have to point that out. When I watch the show, I feel like \"it's funny...because it's true\", you know what I mean? I just hope it doesn't go downhill the way some animated shows do. For instance, Spongebob Squarepants is a (children's) show that has a lot of crazy stuff happening in it, and then the makers of the show began to take the craziness too far (they pretty much milked it to death), and suddenly it just seemed not funny anymore. Everything moved too fast, and for little reason. The humor changed. I worry that a similar fate awaits Regular Show, because it happens to so many others. But if they keep making the show the way they do now, then they'll be fine. And maybe I'll even have my family play Regular Show in the mourning room at my funeral. Anyway, they're aren't a lot of shows reasonably directed at teenagers- you know, teenagers? The people between the stages of childhood and adulthood?- so this show is epic in that sense. It's also epic in all it's other senses.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Regular Show: Win That Prize", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi24231193", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU1NjlmMDYtMzlkYi00OGQxLWFiZDAtYTNmMzM3MjkyNmRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU1NjlmMDYtMzlkYi00OGQxLWFiZDAtYTNmMzM3MjkyNmRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Regular Show: Win That Prize", "uploadDate": "2019-04-12T22:29:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3096205/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "J.G.

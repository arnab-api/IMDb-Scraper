It's not great but it's simply not THAT bad.\n\nAlike Lovecraft Slender Man seems to be one of those commonly used subject matters that always seeems to miss the mark. Filmmakers just don't seem to be able to make the most out of the fantastic material presented before them.\n\nSo yet again we see a tale of a group of young folks on the run from the Slender Man and spooky things happen. Yadayadayada.\n\nWith a decent young cast including Joey King and Annalise Basso we're presented with the glossiest and most high budget Slender Man movie yet. Sadly along with the budget comes all the usual Hollywood horror flaws, demonstrating once again how badly Hollywood have lost their way when it comes to the entire genre.\n\nSure it looks great, but the plot tail spins out of control by about the halfway mark and that's such a shame as up until then it was showing real potential. Hollywood need to go back to the drawing board, hire indie filmmakers to adapt material otherwise we'll just keep getting this Insidious/Conjuring tripe.\n\nSlender Man has it's moments and the concept is pure gold, this however is more squandered potential.\n\nThe Good:\n\nIt's Slender Man!\n\nAtmospheric\n\nGreat cast\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPlot falls apart badly\n\nPotential isn't met\n\nToo many common tropes and cliches\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nSlender Man mythology is fantastic but really inconsistent, no wonder they get it so wrong with adaptations\n\nJoey King and Annalise Basso are going to be big stars\n\nSlender Man is like Aliens (Xenomorphs), he needs keeping in the shadows or he looks a bit silly\n\nThis should have been called The Ring: Slender Man", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi969784089", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NjQyM2UtYjk2OS00ZDk5LTliZTctMmQ2MmM5M2JhOTVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NjQyM2UtYjk2OS00ZDk5LTliZTctMmQ2MmM5M2JhOTVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg", "description": "In a small town in Massachusetts, a group of friends perform a ritual in an attempt to debunk the lore of Slender Man.

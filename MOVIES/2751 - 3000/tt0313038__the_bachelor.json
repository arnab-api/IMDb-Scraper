The concept is simple: get a bunch of attractive and neurotic young women who want to compete for the affections of some adonis and take them on one-on-ones with Mr. God's Gift to Women while the camera follows them and lets the viewer observe all the interesting and melodramatic moments (well most of them - we don't get to witness the sex).  It creates a lot of questions - for example, why would women want to enter a show like this in the first place?  What do they think is in it for them and what is really in it for them?  It all looks good visually - the producers have seen to that - but it is also tacky, shallow and exploitative.  It speaks a lot about America."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Bachelor: Season 23", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3476732953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFmNWM5OTctYzVlMS00MDU5LWE4ZjktNThkMmM5NDYzMTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTFmNWM5OTctYzVlMS00MDU5LWE4ZjktNThkMmM5NDYzMTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Premiere Spot", "uploadDate": "2019-06-14T17:16:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1047343/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Harrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0313038/characters/nm1047343?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "258 episodes, 2002-2021"}]}]}

I am a human being! I \u0085am \u0085a man!'\n\nJohn Merrick (as portrayed in The Elephant Man)\n\n'If Your Life Sucks, Watch this Movie' 'The Elephant Man,' directed by David Lynch and written by Sir Frederick Treves and Ashley Montagu, is a macabre story about Dr. Frederick 'Freddie' Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who shows compassion for a man with Proteous Syndrome John Merrick (John Hurt). The story is based on the true account of John Merrick's life as a side show freak in the nineteenth century. The viewer is taken on a journey of a man trying to regain some self-respect and the doctor who is helping him to do so.\n\nIf you are like me and in a bad space in your life, watch this movie. Although a depressing film there are brief moments of hope with the interaction of Merrick and Treves. But, mostly it is scene after scene of abuse, torture and the dark side of human nature. This is not a movie that a viewer is going to want to watch time and time again. Watching this movie is like being drug through a crime scene, most don't want to look but most can't help themselves. After viewing the film, I felt a lot better about my life, and right now I am unemployed, fat and alone.\n\nThat being said, the movie taken as a work of art was excellent. The black and white cinematography really added to the Victorian feel of the nineteenth century. The character development was superb and the acting of Hopkins and Hurt phenomenal. The makeup and costuming was dark as the film itself and the direction by Lynch, using his signature 'dream' scenes only added to the dimness of the entire film. I highly recommend this film once because it is beautifully directed and a great story. But, unless you are a masochist, once is enough."}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1763229209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyMzMwMmMtZTI1My00NGFmLTllMmEtNTRjOGFmNzJmZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyMzMwMmMtZTI1My00NGFmLTllMmEtNTRjOGFmNzJmZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-06-29T08:59:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000164/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Anthony Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0000164?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Frederick Treves"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000843/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anne Bancroft"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0000843?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mrs. Kendal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0384908/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wendy Hiller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0384908?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mothershead"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0255573/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Elphick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0255573?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Night Porter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0752571/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Helen Ryan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0752571?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Princess Alex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002077/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dexter Fletcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0002077?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bytes' Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0629498/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Phoebe Nicholls"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0629498?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Merrick's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0202575/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Claire Davenport"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0202575?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Fat Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000457/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0000457?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Merrick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000024/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John Gielgud"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0000024?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carr Gomm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428086/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Freddie Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0428086?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bytes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0330240/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hannah Gordon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0330240?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mrs. Treves"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822062/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "John Standing"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0822062?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Fox"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242459/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lesley Dunlop"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0242459?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nora"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331110/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Pat Gorman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080678/characters/nm0331110?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Fairground Bobby"}]}]}

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but I think it's important to note first and foremost that it's a typical 90s movie, so if you're seeking originality you won't find it watching this one.\n\nThe subject matter is that of domestic violence, yet the only wife-beating scene is extremely tame, and instead the film focuses on the psychological repercussions of such violence. Unfortunately, that was pretty tame too. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a sadist who'll only like a movie if it contains harsh physical or psychological harm, but when I watch a thriller on domestic violence, I expect it to be thrilling and violent. Sleeping with the Enemy is practically a family-friendly movie. That's not good because actual domestic violence is absolutely terrifying and horrible, and the movie doesn't do the subject justice. No spoilers here, but the climax is also pretty disappointing. The entire movie was (very decently) building for the final confrontation between the spouses, only for it to be surprisingly quick. Meh!\n\nThe main theme, Berlioz' \"Symphonie Fantastique\" was perhaps chosen as a homage to Kubrick's Shining, which also contains the theme and domestic violence. Unfortunately, whenever the song came up in Sleeping with the Enemy, it only reminded me of how much of a superior movie Shining is.\n\nNow, for the good aspects of the film. It's entertaining, which is the least I can ask for in a movie. Not a dull moment. The acting is very decent, and Julia Roberts is at her prime (that is, physically). I must say though, that the two main males (including the abusive husband) weren't in the least bit interesting. \n\nOther than that, I don't have much else to say. I'll probably forget most of the movie in a month or two, and I won't want to see it again. It isn't very memorable, but I was entertained enough for 90 minutes.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2371272217", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VlZTg3NzYtYjEzNi00MGE1LTg1MGEtYmYxYjk4MDAxZjA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VlZTg3NzYtYjEzNi00MGE1LTg1MGEtYmYxYjk4MDAxZjA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-12T17:07:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000210/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Julia Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102945/characters/nm0000210?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Laura Burney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000754/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102945/characters/nm0000754?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ben Woodward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001717/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kyle Secor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102945/characters/nm0001717?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Fleishman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007762/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tony Abatemarco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102945/characters/nm0007762?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Locke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0893271/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harley Venton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102945/characters/nm0893271?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Garber"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0787111/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sandi Shackelford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102945/characters/nm0787111?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Edna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364270/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Graham Harrington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102945/characters/nm0364270?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Minister"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0733090/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sharon J.

I saw a couple of billboards about it but didn't make it a point to watch but I just watched it On Demand about fifteen minutes ago and found it very entertaining. While it wasn't hysterically funny it had parts that I giggled and I'm certain that as the season progresses, the jokes will get funnier. I grew up when TGIF was popular. Shows like \"Family Matters\", \"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch\", \"Step By Step\", \"Full House\", and others shows came on. It was a great family time for my parents and my brother and I'm certain this is a great show for family.\n\nI read a review saying that this show wasn't \"realistic\" but when it comes to sitcoms like this they're not supposed to be 100% realistic, they're supposed to entertain. The point is to take be inspired by realistic events and exaggerate them for TV's sake. I, personally, am happy that shows like are returning to TV. We need these family sitcoms to invade our TV screens once again so that we can have evenings, like in the past, to watch back to back shows that have values, yet make us laugh.\n\nI say, save the \"realistic\" film and TV for those the drastically deep people trying to win Oscars. This is a great family show, with good actors who have great chemistry on screen. They were some elements that were introduced in the pilot that have me intrigued for more to come. Watch this show. You'll enjoy it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Baby Daddy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2078915865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM3ZTk1NmMtZWQyZi00Y2YzLTkyMDEtNGQ1NDc4M2RiNzc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM3ZTk1NmMtZWQyZi00Y2YzLTkyMDEtNGQ1NDc4M2RiNzc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Baby Daddy", "uploadDate": "2019-04-04T19:36:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1700638/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jean-Luc Bilodeau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2177489/characters/nm1700638?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ben Wheeler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0676292/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Melissa Peterman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2177489/characters/nm0676292?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bonnie Wheeler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005254/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tahj Mowry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2177489/characters/nm0005254?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tucker Dobbs"}, {"url": "#", "name": "99 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6868412/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sura Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2177489/characters/nm6868412?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Emma"}, {"url": "#", "name": "53 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3475387/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Derek Theler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2177489/characters/nm3475387?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Danny Wheeler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1466221/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chelsea Kane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2177489/characters/nm1466221?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Riley Perrin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6868411/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kayleigh Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2177489/characters/nm6868411?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Emma"}, {"url": "#", "name": "53 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}]}

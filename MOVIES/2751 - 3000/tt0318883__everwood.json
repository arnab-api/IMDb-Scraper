I watch the show faithfully every Monday and didn't miss a single episode. Treat Williams is radiant as Dr. Andy Brown, who struggles to be the father he wasn't back in New York, when his wife was alive and his neurological career got ahead of his kids. But tragedy struck and it's him as his two kids in the small town of Everwood, a quaint place surrounded by the Rocky Mountains. The townspeople are quirky and even a bit odd, and it's a useful touch of humor to underlie the serious episodes. Andy does his best to get along with his teenage son Ephram (Gregory Smith), his jealous fellow doctor Harold Abbott (a sometimes annoying character but played by the talented Tom Aamandes), and dealing with tough scenarios. The picturesque backdrop is beautiful. The character development is quite amazing. The scripts are great. And the narration by John Beasley (Irv) is another great factor. You feel at home with this show. It's quite a special TV program that can teach us ALL a lesson or two. \n\nMy only complaint is that in the second season, things have gotten quite soap-opera-ry. Things are too caught up in relationships and Ephram and Amy are just annoying when things don't go their way. Their lives are much easier than they make them out to be, and just about every character will get on your nerves from time to time (but that's what makes it interesting!) - from Delia's big mouth to Harold's crabiness, the only normal character is Andy. He's a voice of reason and a man of patience and medical talent.\n\nThe second season was good but the third will be hopefully better."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Everwood: Father Knows", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1705688345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQzOGFiYTQtMzk3MC00ZWY3LWJmOTUtZWFjNWUwNDA5NmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQzOGFiYTQtMzk3MC00ZWY3LWJmOTUtZWFjNWUwNDA5NmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Everwood: Father Knows", "uploadDate": "2019-03-16T18:12:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001852/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Treat Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0001852?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Andrew ''Andy'' Brown"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0885840/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Emily VanCamp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0885840?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amy Abbott"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0064040/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Beasley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0064040?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Irv Harper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0695435/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Pratt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0695435?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bright Abbott"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0633318/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stephanie Niznik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0633318?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nina Feeney"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0937930/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Scott Wolf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0937930?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dr. Jake Hartman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2004-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0808376/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gregory Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0808376?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ephram Brown"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0600717/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Debra Mooney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0600717?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Edna Harper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1055187/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Vivien Cardone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm1055187?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Delia Brown"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0023885/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tom Amandes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0023885?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Harold Abbott"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0304422/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Merrilyn Gann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0304422?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rose Abbott"}, {"url": "#", "name": "76 episodes, 2002-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0237711/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sarah Drew"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318883/characters/nm0237711?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hannah Rogers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2004-2006"}]}]}

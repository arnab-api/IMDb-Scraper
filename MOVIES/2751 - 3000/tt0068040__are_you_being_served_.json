The only American show that could be compared to AYBS is probably Threes Company, if only for the dirty jokes that pop up on every episode. It was a little weird seeing such proper British people casually tossing off filthy double entendres, but that was part of the charm, the characters were largely oblivious to the fact. My favorite character was Mrs. Slocombe with her sky-high neon-colored hair. She and Mr. Humphries made the show, just like Karen and Jack make Will & Grace, if you get my drift. Mrs. Slocombe had the funniest reactions to every event, no matter how small, and was quick to petulance after her fragile ego was even slightly bruised. I still laugh when I recall scenes from the show, for instance when she walked in one day wearing a brown outfit and Mr. Lucas said \"how now brown cow\", and she glared at him. I'm laughing as I type this. Or the time when Mr. Rumbold became ill and Mrs. Slocombe took over the whole department and used his office, she started ordering all these fancy things befitting an executive, like a new suit, and Mr. Travis said \"She looks like Rocky Marciano\". Then she ate the meringue and got a call from Mr. Rumbold not to eat the meringue, and became violently ill. My favorite Mrs. Slocombe episode, if there is one, is when she can't get home so she stays at Grace Brothers upstairs and has a self-contained apartment. One-by-one, all the other characters, who couldn't get home either, drop by to stay at her apartment and she has to accommodate them all. It's hilarious! There's also one episode where Joanne Lumley makes an appearance and she's young and sexy, she's selling perfume or something.\n\nThis wasn't the best show ever made, but the characters are so well crafted that you feel like Grace Brothers could be a real department store somewhere. Even in the 70s, when this show was made, Grace Brothers seems hopelessly old-fashioned and out of date."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "9Gem Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi277004569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEzMjIxZTgtMjU2Ni00NGM1LWIwMWYtZmMzMGY3YWFlZmVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEzMjIxZTgtMjU2Ni00NGM1LWIwMWYtZmMzMGY3YWFlZmVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-10-05T09:09:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0837444/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mollie Sugden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0837444?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mrs. Slocombe"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1972-1985"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0861530/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Frank Thornton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0861530?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Captain Peacock"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1972-1985"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809448/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nicholas Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0809448?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mr. Rumbold"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1972-1985"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0257583/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Arthur English"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0257583?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mr. Harman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 1976-1985"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0112645/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Arthur Brough"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0112645?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Grainger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "34 episodes, 1972-1977"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0409132/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Inman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0409132?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mr. Humphries"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1972-1985"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0723910/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wendy Richard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0723910?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Miss Brahms"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1972-1985"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0052415/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Trevor Bannister"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0052415?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Lucas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 1972-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0071789/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Harold Bennett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068040/characters/nm0071789?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Young Mr. Grace"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 1972-1981"}]}]}

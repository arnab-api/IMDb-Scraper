CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL \n\nA History of Violence is quite another kind of story altogether! A unique combination of action, drama, suspense, and crime coupled with a suspenseful, intriguing, most interesting, and, at times, even a highly original and touching story. Personally. I think Viggo Mortensen does a spectacular job here in the lead role of Tom Stall, a man who would just as soon have everyone forget completely his dark and violent past! Mortensen (Eastern Promises) is one of the most highly underrated actors working today\u0085\n\nOf course, I have a personal motive for taking a special interest in his career\u0085 Here is something I'll bet quite a few of you don't know about King Aragorn\u0085He is one actor of an extremely select group, who was born into the English language and whose native language is English, but who has managed to acquire a very near-native ability in a second language, Spanish, so much so that he has played convincingly a Native speaker of Spanish in a handful of Spanish language films! Check out his acting filmography here on IMDb! \n\nJust how does this involve me? Well, although I don't appear in films, in any language, I did not speak Spanish until I was 16\u0085and now, after living in Colombia for over a quarter of a century, I usually pass for a native speaker! \n\nVIOLENCE has a lot of other worthwhile things working in its favor. Excellent story and screenplay, plenty of suspense, and mostly outstanding performances turned in by other members of the cast\u0085Especially William Hurt's award winning role. From me\u0085VIOLENCE gets 9 well-deserved Stars!\n\n9*....ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA! \n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English o en Espa\u00f1ol, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "A History of Violence", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1723072793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkxMTg2YTEtNjIwOS00YjA0LWE3NDEtNDhhNmJhZjI4ZDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTkxMTg2YTEtNjIwOS00YjA0LWE3NDEtNDhhNmJhZjI4ZDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from New Line Cinema", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T06:00:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001557/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Viggo Mortensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0001557?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Stall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000438/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ed Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0000438?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carl Fogarty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1525948/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ashton Holmes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm1525948?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jack Stall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0565569/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Stephen McHattie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0565569?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Leland"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0772704/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kyle Schmid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0772704?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bobby Singer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0703499/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gerry Quigley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0703499?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1851025/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Heidi Hayes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm1851025?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sarah Stall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0531628/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bill MacDonald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0531628?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Frank Mulligan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004742/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maria Bello"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0004742?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Edie Stall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000458/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "William Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0000458?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richie Cusack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534132/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter MacNeill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0534132?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sheriff Sam Carney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0117374/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Greg Bryk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0117374?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Billy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0443184/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sumela Kay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0443184?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Judy Danvers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0237034/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Deborah Drakeford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0237034?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Charlotte"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0222593/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Aidan Devine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0399146/characters/nm0222593?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Charlie Roarke"}]}]}

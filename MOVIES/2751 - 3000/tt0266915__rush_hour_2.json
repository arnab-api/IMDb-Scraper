Also when I was growing up, his movies were those which are at times on the television here.\n\nIt was like four or five years back I saw this on an projector at the school hall of my alma mater, as part of the school's post-exam activities. Really, I almost laughed myself silly as I was watching with my other peers then. Like many of us, we grew up watching Jackie's trademark kungfu moves and his amazing stunts which often made us all in awe on the movie screen.\n\nJackie and Chris Tucker's chemistry just clicked with each other. And watching Zhang Ziyi playing a bad girl, it was like - whoa! Watching some of the movie scenes being played out in Hong Kong somehow brought back some memories for this person who grew up watching some of those Hong Kong TV dramas (with subtitles and Mandarin dubbing) on the television here. Looking at some of those scenes, at times I wondered how really the western world will see Hong Kong. But given many knew who is Jackie (he is from Hong Kong himself actually), I knew it's a relief.\n\nThe two guys are just real funny between each other. But when it's time for those kungfu moves and the stunts, it always excite me. It's always like that.\n\nDefinitely really funny.

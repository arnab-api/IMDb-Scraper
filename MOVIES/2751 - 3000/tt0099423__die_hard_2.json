I had heard a few bad things about Die Hard 2, I was a bit nervous to see this film just because of that. But I think it was just because of the fact that a lot of people really compare it to the first Die Hard, like I said there really is no comparison, the first Die Hard was an absolute blast and can't be beat. However, Die Hard 2 is a little looked over, it's still a great sequel in my opinion. It has great action, the same fun characters, and an awesome story. While it was somewhat bland compared to the first Die Hard, this was a fun movie to watch I think.\n\nJohn McClane is back to square one in life, his wife doesn't like him very much right now since he hasn't kept his promises. But she is coming into town for a report and John is there to pick her up. But things are quickly interrupted when Col. Stuart takes control of the airport with high demands of money and power. Unfortunately he doesn't realize who he's messing with when he is aware of John's wife being aboard of one of the planes. Since the airport's power is now out, the planes cannot land and are quickly running out of gas to keep them going. John is on the case though and isn't going to let Col. Stuart get away with this.\n\nDie Hard 2 is a cool movie in my books. William Sadler made a good villain, he's really intense looking and got into character very well. I loved how this movie ended, Holly really kicked more butt in this film. But it is Bruce who really wins the movie over, he's even more bad than ever before, he's just so awesome, you can't help but to keep rooting for him. Not to mention one of the most memorable lines ever \"Yippe-Kia-Mother-\", you get it, but he's the only one that could deliver that line right. I would recommend this movie for anyone, just give it a shot, it's pretty good.\n\n7/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Die Hard 2: Die Harder", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2417468441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE2MTI4Y2QtNjA0OC00ZTFiLWFjNjUtNzM0YzgwM2VlNDAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE2MTI4Y2QtNjA0OC00ZTFiLWFjNjUtNzM0YzgwM2VlNDAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 2 for Die Hard: Die Harder", "uploadDate": "2012-10-11T03:13:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0000246?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John McClane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0040472/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "William Atherton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0040472?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thornberg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0626259/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Franco Nero"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0626259?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Esperanza"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0025309/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Amos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0025309?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Grant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0262543/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Art Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0262543?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Barnes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0101005/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tom Bower"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0101005?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Marvin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0367496/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Don Harvey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0367496?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Garber"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0625664/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Peter Nelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0625664?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000889/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bonnie Bedelia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0000889?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Holly McClane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001817/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Reginald VelJohnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0001817?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Al Powell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006669/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "William Sadler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0006669?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Stuart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001240/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dennis Franz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0001240?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Carmine Lorenzo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000669/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Fred Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0000669?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Trudeau"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0565319/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sheila McCarthy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0565319?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Samantha Coleman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0304393/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tony Ganios"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099423/characters/nm0304393?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Baker"}]}]}

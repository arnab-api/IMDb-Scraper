Just because she is too mature for her age and is a real daddy's girl doesn't mean that people should hate her for that. Anyway about the TV show the show is about a young teenager named Miley Stewart who by day is a country gal and by night with the help of some clothes and a blonde wig she is Hannah Montana. The music is alright and the plot is funny. I find Cyrus to be funny as she always says Jackson said something about what? and she's always fighting with her brother Jackson.\n\nThe movie version of this is very good as it is similar to the TV show except it shows us where she lived and what she is missing out on.\n\nI like the show and I think Cryus is OK a bit too old fashioned and her accent is annoying but still I think she's a decent actress.\n\nIs it me or is she trying to be Hilary Duff's long lost twin with the blonde wig and the style of clothes. Never mind anyway i'll give it a 8/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2220203033", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGZlNDcwNTEtYTAxZS00MjZiLWE3NGUtMzYxNjc4YmIzOTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGZlNDcwNTEtYTAxZS00MjZiLWE3NGUtMzYxNjc4YmIzOTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "US CT #1, Post", "uploadDate": "2011-09-16T03:36:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1415323/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Miley Cyrus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0493093/characters/nm1415323?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Miley Stewart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1489118/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Earles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0493093/characters/nm1489118?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jackson Stewart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1102053/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mitchel Musso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0493093/characters/nm1102053?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Oliver Oken"}, {"url": "#", "name": "91 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2030779/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Moises Arias"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0493093/characters/nm2030779?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rico"}, {"url": "#", "name": "77 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0652089/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Emily Osment"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0493093/characters/nm0652089?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lilly Truscott"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004854/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Billy Ray Cyrus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0493093/characters/nm0004854?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robby Ray Stewart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7524232/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Monica Pinto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0493093/characters/nm7524232?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lesley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 2006-2009"}]}]}

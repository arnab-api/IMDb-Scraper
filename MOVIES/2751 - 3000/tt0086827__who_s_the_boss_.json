It is so much fun to watch, and it's nostalgic.  I like all the characters except for Danny (when he was older his voice sounds....well we won't go there)  As the seasons go on, though, Angela and Tony are the main focus of the show anyway.  I don't get the whole Billy thing, why do shows always do that?  It's almost a guarantee that it's going to be dead in its track within a year or two.  Anyway it did run for a long time, and I love the final episode.  You get to decide how they end.  They need to do a reunion show."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001103/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tony Danza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086827/characters/nm0001103?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tony Micelli"}, {"url": "#", "name": "196 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000192/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alyssa Milano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086827/characters/nm0000192?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Samantha Micelli"}, {"url": "#", "name": "196 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001340/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Katherine Helmond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086827/characters/nm0001340?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mona Robinson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "196 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0509937/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Judith Light"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086827/characters/nm0509937?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Angela Bower"}, {"url": "#", "name": "196 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001622/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Danny Pintauro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086827/characters/nm0001622?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jonathan Bower"}, {"url": "#", "name": "196 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}]}

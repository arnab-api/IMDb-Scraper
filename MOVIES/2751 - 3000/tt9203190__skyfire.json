I hadn't even heard about it before now in 2021 when I sat down to watch it. And I must admit that I didn't really know what to expect from the movie, so writers Wei Bu and Sidney King had every opportunity to impress me and entertain me.\n\nAnd they certainly did that, because \"Skyfire\" turned out to be an enjoyable disaster movie, much akin to \"Volcano\" or \"2012\". So if you enjoy those kind of movies, then you most certainly will also like \"Skyfire\".\n\nSure, the movie's storyline and script was fairly predictable, if not actually generic in terms of what you'd expect from a disaster movie. But still, director Simon West managed to make it into an enjoyable journey nonetheless.\n\nVisually then I must admit that I was definitely impressed with the effects and CGI in this 2019 movie. I do like it when disaster movies have proper CGI and special effects to carry the movie and make it presentable in an enjoyable and realistic manner. And the special effects team definitely did that with \"Skyfire\".\n\nSome of the events that took place throughout the course of the movie. I mean, such as the flying chucks of molten lava that miraculously also manage to strike very close where the protagonists of the movie tend to be at any given moment in the course of the story, or the fact that a certain person was struck by a flying molten rock just as the person was waving good bye. It is stuff like that which makes for stupid moments in disaster movies, and \"Skyfire\" does have its share of such moments.\n\nI found \"Skyfire\" to be a fast paced movie, and director Simon West did manage to keep the movie flowing at a great pace from the beginning and right up to the end.\n\nMy rating of \"Skyfire\" lands on a six out of ten stars. I was wholeheartedly entertained by this disaster movie. And I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch it, should you have the chance, and especially so if you enjoy disaster movies.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Skyfire", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1966325273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE5YmMzNWYtM2Q0Yi00YTRjLTlhMjUtNjFiMTc1N2Q3ZmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE5YmMzNWYtM2Q0Yi00YTRjLTlhMjUtNjFiMTc1N2Q3ZmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-05-30T17:02:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10669842/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bee Rogers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm10669842?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Young Meng"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1281653/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Xueqi Wang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm1281653?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Wentao Li"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9891349/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lingchen Ji"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm9891349?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bo Teng"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0943095/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Liang Shi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm0943095?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Professor Jiang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005042/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jason Isaacs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm0005042?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jack Harris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10669841/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "An Bai"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm10669841?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jiahui Dong"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8108346/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jianmin Cui"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm8108346?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Investor 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10669874/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Yiqing Li"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm10669874?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Shanshan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2061274/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alice Rietveld"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm2061274?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sue Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5050883/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hannah Quinlivan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm5050883?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Meng Li"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4081050/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Shawn Dou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm4081050?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Zhengnan Xiao"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0950554/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ryun Yu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm0950554?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lei Xu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8537983/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Xinmo Ma"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm8537983?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Qianwei Wang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10452610/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tongjiang Hou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm10452610?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Grandpa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1927199/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Gigi Velicitat"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9203190/characters/nm1927199?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Investor 2"}]}]}

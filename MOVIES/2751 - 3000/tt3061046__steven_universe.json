I watched the first episode not knowing what to expect, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. It had an innocent, down to earth feeling that made me recall the happiness of my childhood and the struggles of learning my own talents. After that, I got hooked on everything, from all the characters to the grade A puns! \n\nEach of the characters, minor and main, has their own personality that gives them life and humane attributes. If I'd imagine, I could probably see a Lars down the block, or maybe a Connie, reading in the library. Onion, by far, has to be my favorite, though, with his overall oddness and limited speech.\n\nThe drawing of the characters, as well, is so different from what there is nowadays. There are all kinds of shapes and sizes for the characters, so many different colors and designs. It's not something I usually see, and it's sort of... refreshing? Yeah! Highly recommended, with an added, \"Don't knock it 'til you watch it!\"", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Steven Universe | Diamond Days Extended Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3322919449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhkMmU4NjMtNDQyMS00M2ZlLTlhYTMtOTIxZDc5OGRhMmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhkMmU4NjMtNDQyMS00M2ZlLTlhYTMtOTIxZDc5OGRhMmExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Steven and the Crystal Gems travel to Home World in the latest episodes of Steven Universe: Diamond Days", "uploadDate": "2019-01-29T23:13:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2642131/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Zach Callison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3061046/characters/nm2642131?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steven Universe"}, {"url": "#", "name": "175 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2007163/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michaela Dietz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3061046/characters/nm2007163?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amethyst"}, {"url": "#", "name": "124 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0536281/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Deedee Magno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3061046/characters/nm0536281?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pearl"}, {"url": "#", "name": "129 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1678063/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Estelle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3061046/characters/nm1678063?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Garnet"}, {"url": "#", "name": "119 episodes, 2013-2020"}]}]}

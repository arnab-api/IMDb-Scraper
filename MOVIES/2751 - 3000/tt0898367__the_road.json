The tone of the novel is almost unremittingly bleak and a 100% faithful adaptation would be very difficult to watch.\n\nI'm happy to report that the film is very good indeed. It solves the problem of being unendurably depressing by concentrating on the emotional impact of the unspecified Armageddon, rather than the day to day fight for food, shelter and so on. So while at times it remains very upsetting it is shot through with hope rather than despair. I always felt the end of the novel was somewhat out of kilter with the rest of it but in the film it seems quite appropriate.\n\nI think the film is more about the collapse of civility rather than civilization: for a film that shows the last remnants of mankind struggling to eke out an existence it is remarkably concerned with relationships. That's probably why the exact cause of the catastrophe is left blank: the film isn't really about the end of the world so much as the end of society. It's an interesting companion piece to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in which an ageing man sees nothing but horror in the modern world. In THE ROAD a man convinces himself, for the sake of his son, that humanity will abide even in the face of appalling conditions.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Road: International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3501917209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMDU3ODc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3ODMwMw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwMDU3ODc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3ODMwMw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A father (Mortensen) and son (Smit-McPhee) walk for months across a ravaged, post-apocalyptic landscape in search of civilization.", "uploadDate": "2009-12-05T08:59:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001557/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Viggo Mortensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0001557?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000380/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Duvall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0000380?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Old Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0662504/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Molly Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0662504?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Motherly Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226813/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Garret Dillahunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0226813?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gang Member"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0421114/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bob Jennings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0421114?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bearded Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0815383/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Buddy Sosthand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0815383?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Archer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0258743/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jack Erdie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0258743?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bearded Man #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1580083/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gina Preciado"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm1580083?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Well Fed Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2240346/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kodi Smit-McPhee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm2240346?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001602/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Guy Pearce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0001602?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Veteran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931324/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Kenneth Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0931324?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Thief"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000234/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Charlize Theron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0000234?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0380732/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Agnes Herrmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm0380732?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Archer's Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3272612/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kirk Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm3272612?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bearded Face"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2980909/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "David August Lindauer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0898367/characters/nm2980909?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Man On Mattress"}]}]}

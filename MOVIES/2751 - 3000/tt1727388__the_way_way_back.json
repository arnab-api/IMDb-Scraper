The dynamic duo team of Nat Faxon & Jim Rash have swimmingly perfected a film that homages \"Meatballs\" and puts a new spin to it, without duplicating it; and that would be in their craft filmmaking of \"The Way Way Back\". The film stars teen actor Liam James as 14 year-old Duncan who is an isolated teen who despises the idea of taking a summer vacation with his timid mother Pam, her arrogant boyfriend Trent, and Trent's narcissistic daughter Steph. Their vacation spot is at Trent's beach house where nearby has a water park; I will slide into that one a little later in my review. Trent does have a few eccentric neighbors in his beach house which include the lush-filled gabby Betty, a divorc\u00e9e with three kids; and also the vociferous couple Kip & Joan. Duncan is constantly ridiculed and excluded by Trent and Stephanie which puts him in the perpetual state of \"I want to get the f*ck of out of here\". However, in a twist of fate, Duncan befriends the vivacious water park employee Owen, perfectly played by Sam Rockwell. Consequently, Duncan starts to regularly visit the water park to hang with Owen and the other water park wacky employees. And before you know it, Duncan plummets himself to a part-time working gig at the park; unknowing to his mom and Trent. Duncan takes flight at the water park and you see the \"coming-of-age\" turn at every moment in his time there. Owen's character is very reminiscent of the Tripper character (played to the tee by Bill Murray) in \"Meatballs\". But Rockwell plays the part so superbly that it does not appear to be a Tripper duplication but instead a modern transformation within its Tripper homage; tripped out yet? Duncan also befriends Betty's teen daughter Susanna, who empathizes with Duncan's situation in dealing with a callous potential stepdaddy. Faxon & Rash's masterful direction & screenplay of \"The Way Way Back\" was not dead on the water; in fact- the vitality, humor, and tenderness they brought to the movie's direction & screenplay should hopefully land them in the wave of Oscar contenders for Best Director & Best Original Screenplay. As far as the thespian pool of the picture, I must state that it was a perfect ensemble. James showed potentiality that he will be on his way back to other leading roles with his fine work as Duncan. Steve Carell's performance as Trent showed the depth to his acting by playing a part non-typical to the Carell filmography; Trent was sure one heartless bastard, and Carell disappeared into the role. Toni Collette was spic & spam in her role as Duncan's mom Pam. Faxon & Rash themselves were a hoot playing two water park employees, Roddy and Lewis. Other supporting turns that were no lazy river works were of Anna Sophia Robb as Susanna, Rob Corddry & Amanda Peet who we had fun with as Kip & Joan, and Maya Rudolph as water park manager Caitlin; and I would be remiss if I did not mention the standout, scene-stealing performance from Allison Janney as the wickedly-hilarious Betty. Be it as it may, it was still Rockwell that stole the show here. His work in \"The Way Way Back\" should slide him into a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. \"The Way Way Back\" is a gem of a movie, and I hope it does not land \"way way back\" in your \"movies to see\" list; if for no better reason, you will be delaying time in missing one heck of a flick. ***** Excellent", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Version 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi350004761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3OTU4OTc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3OTU4OTc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Over the course of his summer break, a teenager comes into his own thanks in part to the friendship he strikes up with one of the park's managers.", "uploadDate": "2013-04-13T12:50:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0136797/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Carell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0136797?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Trent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005049/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Allison Janney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0005049?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Betty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005377/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sam Rockwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0005377?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Owen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416699/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Liam James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0416699?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Duncan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001605/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amanda Peet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0001605?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4534201/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Zoe Levin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm4534201?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Steph"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0711110/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jim Rash"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0711110?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lewis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3924836/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jeremy Weaver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm3924836?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001057/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Toni Collette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0001057?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1455681/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "AnnaSophia Robb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm1455681?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Susanna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0748973/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maya Rudolph"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0748973?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Caitlin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1117791/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rob Corddry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm1117791?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kip"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3788762/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "River Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm3788762?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Peter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269542/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nat Faxon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm0269542?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Roddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4835911/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Adam Riegler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1727388/characters/nm4835911?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Neil"}]}]}

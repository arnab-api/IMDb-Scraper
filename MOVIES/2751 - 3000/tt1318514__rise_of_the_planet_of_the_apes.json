I'm a huge fan of the series (excluding the Tim Burton disaster, of course) but this didn't have nearly the depth nor the intelligence I was expecting. Like most I was initially skeptical at the idea of attempting to reboot the franchise -- but as positive reviews kept flowing in regarding this \"smart\" script and Avatar-like CGI, I began to get excited again. With the surprisingly high box office numbers and positive feedback from most who saw it, I got more excited.\n\nI finally ponied up last night to check it out.\n\nThe good news: The CGI apes stuff works pretty well. Serkis does his usual great job (although I thought his King Kong was better). Action sequences and set pieces are all good.\n\nThe bad news: There's no Rod Serling-style, Twilight Zone-ish, philosophical themes or moral messages here. It isn't \"smart\" compared to the original films. This one is more like POTA for Dummies. It relies on a trite storyline that's been beaten to death (Don't play God; Don't mess with Nature -- yada, yada, yada) with nothing more interesting or thought-provoking. The original series was not afraid to hit you in the gut and make you think. Those movies were much heavier in every way; while this plays much more like a straight action film. Entertaining from that aspect -- along with Caesar himself, but not much else. So, I don't know where all this \"smart\" talk came from. If this passes for smart then our standards have dropped.\n\nNext is the acting. I don't blame the actors b/c it didn't seem that they had much to work with. Franco, Pinto, Felton, Cox and the rest are all one-note characters with little depth. All the humans are cardboard clich\u00e9s in this film. I know Caesar is the protagonist -- but to have the other actors be so uninteresting is a real drawback. And this -- along with the trite story -- reminds me a bit of Avatar. A by-the-numbers retelling of Pocahontas or Dances with Wolves -- where all the characters are one-dimensional. Visually stunning, yes -- but with shallow characterizations. In Avatar, military guy = bad, corporate exec = bad; in ROTPOTA, drug company exec = bad, neighbor = bad, chimp worker = bad. There's not much else to say about them since we're not presented with their context.\n\nNo one wanted to like this more than me. I was hoping the flavor of the original series had been brought back -- but I'm afraid if we can't resurrect Rod Serling or enlist a writer of his caliber, we'll never see it again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1615502617", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2", "uploadDate": "2011-06-03T19:42:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785227/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Andy Serkis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0785227?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Caesar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1024953/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Terry Notary"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm1024953?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rocket"}, {"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm1024953?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bright Eyes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1341724/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Christopher Gordon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm1341724?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Koba - Ape"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0135778/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jay Caputo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0135778?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alpha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2951768/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Freida Pinto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm2951768?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Caroline Aranha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004051/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brian Cox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0004051?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John Landon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0654648/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Oyelowo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0654648?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Steven Jacobs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364807/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jamie Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0364807?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rodney - Shelter Assistant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0465269/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Karin Konoval"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0465269?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maurice"}, {"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0465269?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Court Clerk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0725956/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard Ridings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0725956?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Buck - Ape"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1981476/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Devyn Dalton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm1981476?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cornelia - Ape"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0290556/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James Franco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0290556?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Will Rodman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001475/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "John Lithgow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0001475?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Charles Rodman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0271657/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tom Felton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0271657?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dodge Landon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0479527/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tyler Labine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1318514/characters/nm0479527?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Robert Franklin"}]}]}

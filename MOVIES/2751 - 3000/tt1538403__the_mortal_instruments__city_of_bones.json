First off I will say that I am a fan of the series and I will try to make this review as middle ground as possible.\n\nI have spent the last few days reading over threads on the discussion board and once the critics reviews came out I read most of those too. Yes I know a lot were negative and abrasive, and sometimes even childish in their mockery of the young adult genre. I went into this movie as open-minded as possible knowing that there were some changes made to the film.\n\nFirstly, several reviews, both good and bad, had issues with the pacing. The time line is very condensed at the start of the film so things do seem to be happening in a whirlwind. This is because they condensed a few of the events from the novel into a shorter time span to enable the movie not to drawl on and be way too long. I didn't mind how they chose to change things up a bit and thought they tied things together fairly well. I just could see it being a bit hard to follow for the non fans that don't know what was cut out.\n\nI was worried about the romance being played up too much since some reviews were so caught up in the triangle. It was a small part of the bigger story much like in the book. Parts of it did come off a bit cheesy, but overall it did not overpower the movie like I thought it was.\n\nI really enjoyed the action sequences. They weren't too short or too long and I felt they were well coordinated. There's definitely enough action for the guys that will be dragged to this with their girlfriends.\n\nSome of the changes will probably be unsettling to the fans or upsetting because more of the film was different than I was warned or expected. Many reviewers were adamant that it kept to the book most of the time, but I would say it was a pretty even mix.\n\nLike most fans I had a certain idea how some scenes or characters would be and I felt a little let down because characters weren't how I imagined or expected them. Magnus falls flat and lacks the charisma and attitude of his book counterpart. I also felt the way Valentine was played/portrayed did not fall in line with how he was in the book. But everyone who reads has there own interpretations and he wasn't close to he Valentine I had envisioned.\n\nLastly I feel this is a pretty solid movie for the fans and non readers. I wouldn't say it's perfect, few movies have ever come close to achieving that status. There are a lot of good elements going on here and a lot of decent acting from people I least expected it given the time they had to actually develop the characters. If you have any interest in watching the movie don't let all the negativity sway you. Go in with an open mind and make your own judgement. I won't say I loved this movie, but I did really enjoy it and would definitely see it again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H10M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3545212441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNzA0ODM4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM4OTA3OQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNzA0ODM4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM4OTA3OQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When her mom is attacked and taken from their home in New York City by a demon, a seemingly ordinary teenage girl, Clary Fray, finds out truths about her past and bloodline on her quest to get her back, that changes her entire life.", "uploadDate": "2013-06-19T20:37:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2934314/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lily Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1538403/characters/nm2934314?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0954225/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin Zegers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1538403/characters/nm0954225?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alec"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1588066/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robert Sheehan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1538403/characters/nm1588066?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Simon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0243806/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kevin Durand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1538403/characters/nm0243806?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pangborn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372176/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lena Headey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1538403/characters/nm0372176?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jocelyn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001634/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "CCH Pounder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1538403/characters/nm0001634?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dorothea"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001667/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jonathan Rhys Meyers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1538403/characters/nm0001667?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Valentine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1242679/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stephen R.

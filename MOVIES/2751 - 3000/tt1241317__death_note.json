From a directional standpoint, to acting, to script writing, everything. The VFX is horrible in this movie. It's so low budget, you'd imagine it be a cheap TV show. Ryuk's forehead is too big and feels nonexistent within the mise-en-scene. Light Yagami is everything wrong, changed to a bullied kid to feel politically relevant and correct. He's just eccentric, over the top, and a creepy looking mofo. Mia is supposed to be Misa? She is changed to a typical short girl cheerleader who follows Light around. Also, why would anyone name their kid Light in America is beyond me. This movie was rushed. From the start, we already see the book falling down. There is no build up to this or tension, it just falls and it's one of the cheapest looking movie production props I have ever seen. The design is something you'd see from a fanmade film. Then, the title sequence. They got the colors right at first, but then they went with complete blue, when it should be red and a bit of purple. All of the dialogue is awkward and choppy. Terrible line deliveries from each actor, just overcooked and several mumbling moments. The deaths were immoral, stupid, and just goes to Final Destination B-movie horror territory. The writers they hired wrote Immortal, a terrible movie with Henry Cavill. So, it was doomed to suck to begin with. They hired Adam Wingard too who directed the overrated The Guest. He's just bad, they should stop hiring him. His camera tricks are cheap, choppy, and horrible to look at. Blair Witch was unwatchable, this one is almost too. Ugliest looking cinematography of the year, muddy, unsmooth, bad shot composition, and student film level. The music choice is pop/techno like music and it is all wrong. Death Note was Gothic, operatic, and heavy metal. The only thing they got right was Ryuk's voice.\n\n2/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3151411481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJmNjM3ZmYtNjRjNC00NTkxLWEzNzItZGE0OGE4M2ZjOGI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJmNjM3ZmYtNjRjNC00NTkxLWEzNzItZGE0OGE4M2ZjOGI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Intoxicated by the power of a supernatural notebook, a young man begins killing those he deems unworthy of life.", "uploadDate": "2017-06-29T15:38:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1822659/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nat Wolff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm1822659?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Light Turner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4960279/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Margaret Qualley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm4960279?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mia Sutton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000353/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Willem Dafoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm0000353?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ryuk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1478697/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Paul Nakauchi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm1478697?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Watari"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2254636/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matthew Kevin Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm2254636?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Agent Young"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1877819/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Timothy Lambert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm1877819?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dr. Norman Ludlam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1642735/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Justin Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm1642735?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Undercover Agent #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4730571/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Artin John"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm4730571?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Antony Skomal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3147751/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "LaKeith Stanfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm3147751?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "L"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0924154/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shea Whigham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm0924154?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James Turner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4272467/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jason Liles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm4272467?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ryuk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5443751/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jack Ettlinger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm5443751?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kenny Doyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0110167/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chris Britton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm0110167?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Peltz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0024780/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kwesi Ameyaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm0024780?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Undercover Agent #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2315589/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Christian Sloan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1241317/characters/nm2315589?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Agent Franks"}]}]}

It's the photography that I really appreciated in this story of a couple's effort to brave the ordeal of being thrashed around in the Pacific Ocean during a Category 4 typhoon. \n\nRight from the opening sequence, Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur has his cinematographer Robert Richardson photograph a long tracking shot of Shailene Woodley splashing about in the cabin of a waterlogged sailboat looking for her fiancee and trying to get her bearings. As she emerges from down below, Richardson continues the shot with an invisible wipe of an ocean wave above the boat before Woodley realizes her boyfriend is missing. The breathtaking sequence sets the pace for what is an amazingly rich tapestry of photographic wonders.\n\nOne other particularly unusual shot is when Ms. Woodley dives into a river from a cliff while her boyfriend Sam Claflin is concerned about her well-being when she doesn't come out of the water. Richardson's camera parallels him as he leaps from the cliff, following him into the water and continuing underneath the water's surface until he finds Woodley alive. \n\nThose two shots alone are worth the price of admission. Never mind that the story is riveting, despite some sequences where landlubbers would consider slow at times. Otherwise, Adrift should get at least an Academy Award nomination for cinematography--it is that good.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2504636441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNjNjQyMzgtNWQ3Mi00NGZiLWJjYWYtMzJjMzE0ZjQ4MzE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNjNjQyMzgtNWQ3Mi00NGZiLWJjYWYtMzJjMzE0ZjQ4MzE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "As the two avid sailors set out on a journey across the ocean, Tami Oldham (Woodley) and Richard Sharp (Claflin) couldn't anticipate they would be sailing directly into one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history.

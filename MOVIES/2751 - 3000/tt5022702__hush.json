It's actually her skills as a writer (she is completing her latest crime novel when the would be assassin strikes) that gives her some traction in what should be a one-sided battle.\n\nThis is an intelligent, well paced and well shot, low budget slasher movie, but on a higher plane.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H22M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hush | Official Trailer-1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi522762777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE2ZTM3ZDYtMTU4ZC00NjQ5LWI0Y2YtYzFkYjI4ODBhOWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE2ZTM3ZDYtMTU4ZC00NjQ5LWI0Y2YtYzFkYjI4ODBhOWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Kate Siegel, John Gallagher Jr.", "uploadDate": "2019-01-03T17:04:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0302330/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Gallagher Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5022702/characters/nm0302330?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "The Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0873998/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Trucco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5022702/characters/nm0873998?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4738909/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emma Graves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5022702/characters/nm4738909?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Max"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2318089/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate Siegel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5022702/characters/nm2318089?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maddie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1418096/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Samantha Sloyan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5022702/characters/nm1418096?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sarah"}]}]}

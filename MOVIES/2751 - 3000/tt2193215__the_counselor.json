It is very different than it's advertised, or what people may be expecting. On the outside it looks like a thriller, and it does have the set up of a good thriller, but its more just a dark brooding and sometimes darkly humorous drama that has thriller like moments. I'm fairly certain if you liked No Country for Old Men the style won't be all that different to you, since it is written by Cormac McCarthy like the source material for that one was, except The Counselor was personally written by his hand alone. I've read reviews complaining its too predictable but I feel like that's the point, as it involves a relatively \"good man\" getting in bed with a drug cartel and everyone kind of tells him to be sure that he understands, that bad things could/will happen. I don't see this as a complaint, since A.) real people get involved in this stuff knowing bad things can happen despite all the warnings heard ahead of time and B.) some of the obvious foreshadows have great pay offs, and C.) knowing what's to come and watching anyways has a sort of knowing dread about it. Anyways, I've read a couple reviews offering it high praise and a lot of them completely bashing it, I'm somewhere in the middle but leaning more toward the former positive critique. It is a slow moving film, with lots of dialogue, and every character seems to get a lengthy monologue.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi185837849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNTQzOTYyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzNzgwMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNTQzOTYyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzNzgwMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A lawyer finds himself in over his head when he gets involved in drug trafficking.", "uploadDate": "2013-08-21T08:56:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1055413/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Fassbender"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm1055413?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Counselor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000139/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cameron Diaz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm0000139?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Malkina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6053309/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cesar Aguirre"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm6053309?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Truck Driver #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1259158/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Obi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm1259158?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Malkina's Bodyguard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3450051/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Richard Cabral"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm3450051?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Young Biker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000093/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brad Pitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm0000093?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Westray"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3520393/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dar Dash"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm3520393?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Barman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3727971/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Alex Hafner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm3727971?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Highway Patrolman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004851/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm0004851?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000849/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Javier Bardem"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm0000849?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Reiner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390486/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Daniel Holgu\u00edn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm0390486?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Truck Driver #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004486/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bruno Ganz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm0004486?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Diamond Dealer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3842446/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Provence Maydew"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm3842446?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Woman in Grocery Store"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420219/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Paris Jefferson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm0420219?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001609/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rosie Perez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2193215/characters/nm0001609?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ruth"}]}]}

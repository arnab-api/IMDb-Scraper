No longer the cocky man he was in \"The Hustler,\" Eddie (Paul Newman) in 1986 is retired from pool and a successful investor. When he spots hot-shot Vince (Tom Cruise), he decides to invest in him and take him on the road, with the goal of Vince winning a big pool tournament in Atlantic City. Along the way, Eddie confronts what he was and is no more and looks at the dreams he let die. When Vince is too foolish and strong-willed to take his advice, Eddie makes an important decision.\n\nThough not as strong a film as \"The Hustler,\" \"The Color of Money\" is still an excellent film with a great cast led by Newman, at the peak of his \"older man\" good looks and the brilliant acting he's always had. And, as usual, he tells you everything you need to know about a character. It's clear that he was content with his life and his attractive girlfriend (Helen Shaver) until he saw Vince. Then the old restlessness and competitiveness came creeping back into his blood.\n\nSeeing Tom Cruise in 1986 is startling since today, the lower half of his face has changed drastically due to plastic surgery. Here he conveys the raw, youthful energy that helped make him a star. Like many successful movie actors, he has a wonderful physical agility. His pompadoured Vince is a short-tempered, jealous, talented ingrate who can't help showing off. Cruise is very effective, as is Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio as his sultry, beautiful girlfriend in another role she made memorable in the '80s.\n\nBeautifully directed by Scorcese, \"The Color of Money\" shows that it's never too late to follow your dreams and, with the right actors and the right script, you can do a good sequel even 25 years after the original.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4285775385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZjNjRmYWMtYzE5ZS00MGQzLWFhNDAtYmYxYmIxMWEyODk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZjNjRmYWMtYzE5ZS00MGQzLWFhNDAtYmYxYmIxMWEyODk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-21T11:15:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000056/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Newman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0000056?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eddie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001512/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0001512?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carmen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001806/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Turturro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0001806?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Julian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0013067/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Robert Agins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0013067?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Earl at Chalkie's"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0036269/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Randall Arney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0036269?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Child World Customer #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0195101/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Vito D'Ambrosio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0195101?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lou at Child World"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230297/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lisa Dodson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0230297?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Child World Customer #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0311867/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Paul Geier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0311867?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Two Brothers"}, {"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0311867?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stranger Player"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000129/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tom Cruise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0000129?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Vincent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001726/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Helen Shaver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0001726?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Janelle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167850/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bill Cobbs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0167850?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Orvis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0025692/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alvin Anastasia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0025692?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kennedy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001968/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Elizabeth Bracco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0001968?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Diane at Bar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212939/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ron Dean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090863/characters/nm0212939?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Guy in Crowd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0270337/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Donald A.

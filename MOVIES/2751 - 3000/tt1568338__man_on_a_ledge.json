And, after about fifteen minutes, the jury was still out. A man, played by Sam Worthington, climbs out onto a hotel ledge and threatens to jump. We don't know why yet. Hopefully we will. So I watched on.\n\nI guess the closest film like this was probably Phone Booth, i.e. it's primarily set in one, very public, location. However, Man on a Ledge is definitely different. Without giving too much away, the 'man' is on a mission and there are enough different locations in and around the building to hopefully not bore the viewer. There's action, conspiracies, baddies and everything you'd probably expect.\n\nBasically, it's a thriller and not a bad one at that. I didn't expect to like it. I'm not a fan of Sam Worthington generally and I thought the 'on a ledge' idea was a bit gimmicky and couldn't see where they were going to go with it.\n\nNow, on reflection, I'm glad I didn't know too much about the plot. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nNot a classic, but certainly good enough to entertain (although you may have to suspend your disbelief to fully appreciate it - there were parts that may not quite have happened that way in real life - the heroes were pretty lucky in places, but isn't that why we watch films?).\n\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Elizabeth Banks Speaks", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4159021337", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MTU0MzE1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU5NTIzNw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MTU0MzE1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU5NTIzNw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Elizabeth Banks narrates the trailer for Man on a Ledge.", "uploadDate": "2012-01-27T21:18:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0941777/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sam Worthington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1568338/characters/nm0941777?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nick Cassidy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006669/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "William Sadler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1568338/characters/nm0006669?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Valet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0810397/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "J.

It wasn't what I intended to see when I traveled to the cinemas last month, but it's what I got. I don't have much to say about the actors, or directors, nor their previous films. I simply walked into this movie blind. It's from this perspective that I'll put together my short review. The Endless is a film about time, life and consequences, coupled with supernatural themes and elements.\n\nThe Endless starts out poorly and awkwardly with obvious low production value, stale acting and a weirdly present shaky cam. The poor impression this put on me harmed the film in the short term, but actually left a lot of room for it to move upwards, and that it did. The film itself decently improves once the plot moves from the characters normal lives and into the isolated country area where the rest of the movie takes place.\n\nThe plot itself is the movies strongest suit, but that isn't saying much. It delivers decently on tense moments, interesting characters and creative concepts. Throughout the film I had to remain on my toes to stay on top of some of its more convoluted elements, which I'm going to put into the negative category. I honestly believe a film's plot should at least on a surface level be completely graspable in a first watch, with still plenty of underlying points and themes waiting to be discovered later.\n\nBy and large the film didn't capture my attention for very long and its even taken me a while to get around to writing this review. In summary, the film keeps itself moving on its good pacing and plot, but is constantly brought down by over-complicated elements and stale acting. I had originally considered a 7 out of 10 for the film, but on revision I think I will leave it with a 6.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3745232921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTlhMTY2MWYtZGE2YS00YmMwLTg3N2QtMzlkZDk0NTYzMzhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTlhMTY2MWYtZGE2YS00YmMwLTg3N2QtMzlkZDk0NTYzMzhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two brothers receive a cryptic video message inspiring them to revisit the UFO death cult they escaped a decade earlier.

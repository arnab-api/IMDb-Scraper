As an avid collector of DVD's (especially classic TV shows), this is by far one of the best shows ever on TV. I was very surprised the way it tugged and brought out so many different emotions from laughing to anger to tears and I am not someone to easily get teary-eyed from TV or movies. The acting is superb by most all the actors making very very believable characters--some u love to hate. Racism being a very major part of this TV series against the blacks, indians, Chinese and most all races other than white, was a major theme for this show. The historical accuracy was superb also and anyone with any knowledge of history can vouch for that. The treatment of the Indians by the government was spot on and the show did a great job of showing those despicable acts by many of historys famous figures (Gen. Custer, Gen. Wooden were nothing short of murderers believing genocide of the Indians was the only way)including the murder of more Indian women and children than braves. Anyone giving this show some thought as to watching it please do so, it truly is superb. Being a man, I rarely care much for romance in movies and TV per say but the great on screen chemistry between Jane Seymour and Joe Lando was awesome and really made this show even better. Also the evolution of some of the townspeople character going from pure racists to acceptance of other races through the series 6 year run also gave such great credibility to the show and like i said before many many of the shows really pulled at my heartstrings while others were very funny,,,,I was very impressed with the actors portraying the townspeople and hands up to Jason Leland Adams who is a great actor playing Custer in the season 2 and 3 and joining the cast as banker Preston Lodge III seasons 4-6 (any actor that can make u despise the character they are portraying is a great actor),,superb show well worth buying the entire series,,watching the shows from the pilot through 6 seasons and the final 2 movies made all the difference in the world in coming to appreciate the highest quality of the writing, acting and explosive issues this show tackled (rape, murder, death, cancer, discrimination of race and gender, etc. etc. ,many of which are still major issues in todays time. I also appreciated the medical issues regarding diagnosis, medical equipment and medicines used in the 1860's,,,very authentic show specializing in the crucial importance of family values,,a show for all families as my whole family has benefited from watching these DVD's over and over, I have watched the entire series within 6 weeks of purchasing it and now have started rewatching and its nice how i can catch things i previously missed during my watching the series the first time.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: When A Child Is Born, Part 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4275617049", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTdlOWNhNWEtMjY3MS00NTY3LTgwNjYtOGFkNGE1NzBkMTVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTdlOWNhNWEtMjY3MS00NTY3LTgwNjYtOGFkNGE1NzBkMTVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: When A Child Is Born, Part 1", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T15:30:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005412/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jane Seymour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103405/characters/nm0005412?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Quinn - Medicine Woman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 1993-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0867592/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Shawn Toovey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103405/characters/nm0867592?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brian Cooper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 1993-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004730/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Orson Bean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103405/characters/nm0004730?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Loren Bray"}, {"url": "#", "name": "148 episodes, 1993-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0794687/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "William Shockley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103405/characters/nm0794687?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hank Lawson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "123 episodes, 1993-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0523186/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Geoffrey Lower"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103405/characters/nm0523186?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rev.

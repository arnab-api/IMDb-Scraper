Starring one of my favorite actors Matt LeBlanc(from \"Friends\" and \"Episodes\" fame)as Adam Burns a man's who's decided to stay at home and raise his kids even though he's got his own contractor supply business on the side, and it's the Mrs. Burns(Liza Snyder)who has went back to work in the medical field. And yes as expected this brings some growing pains in the form of dealing with the kids and then both Adam and Andi have their own marriage problems. It's a typical sitcom with good one liners and funny stories as it mixes today's culture with family life, so take my advice and give \"Man with a Plan\" a watch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Man With a Plan--First Look", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2876684057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2OTc4OTM1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU1MTc1OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2OTc4OTM1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU1MTc1OTE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2016-07-29T01:19:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001455/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt LeBlanc"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm0001455?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Adam Burns"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2016-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3129512/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matt Cook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm3129512?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lowell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2016-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7245418/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Matthew McCann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm7245418?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Teddy Burns"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2016-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005265/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kevin Nealon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm0005265?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Don Burns"}, {"url": "#", "name": "68 episodes, 2016-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0733812/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kali Rocha"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm0733812?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marcy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "50 episodes, 2016-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0811513/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Liza Snyder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm0811513?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Andi Burns"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2016-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4272103/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Grace Kaufman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm4272103?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kate Burns"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2016-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6442629/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hala Finley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm6442629?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Emme Burns"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2016-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005078/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Stacy Keach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536400/characters/nm0005078?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joe"}, {"url": "#", "name": "50 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}]}

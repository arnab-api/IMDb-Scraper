When you watch this movie, you are unleashing a very powerful force that short-circuits your natural ability to remain in control. It is like hypnotism, you have no choice...you are unable to think, act, or even believe apart from the intense feelings Jacob's Ladder inspires.\n\nTim Robbins is Jacob Singer, a warm and genuinely likable Vietnam veteran who, in spite of earning a doctoral degree, chooses to find employment working for the U.S. Postal Service. We learn in bits and pieces as the plot unfolds that his service in Vietnam included a very frightening battle, and the events set in motion on that fateful day parallel what could be his descent into madness.\n\nJacob's life suddenly begins to resemble Hell. He is literally chased by confusion, fear, and death, he sees unbelievably terrifying images, has horrific experiences that whether real or imagined are too frightening to bear alone. His only comfort comes in the form of the woman he lives with, Jezzie (Elizabeth Pena), and his chiropractor, Louis (Danny Aiello). Each of these people's relationships with Jacob represent more than just the roles they fulfill in his life, they are absolute forces at battle for his sanity, and possibly even his soul.\n\nHis torment begins to include the past as well, the undeniable love he still has for his ex-wife and painful memories of his son Gabe, who died tragically in an accident (played by a young and virtually undiscovered Macauley Culkin). As all these elements of the past, present and future collide in shocking hallucinations, Jacob slowly begins to suspect he could be the victim of a secret Army drug experiment gone terribly wrong.\n\nWith a haunted desperation, he embarks on a journey to find out what on earth happened to him - only his visions / flashbacks / flashforwards have become so delusional that reality and fantasy are hopelessly interwoven and nothing is as it seems. All that is decipherable is good and evil, life and death. And at the end of his nightmare, all he has to do is choose.\n\nThat's all I will share of the story. I'm not going to do you the disservice of spoiling the experience this movie is. Suffice it to say, there is much more to know, and nothing left to tell.\n\nMeanwhile, there is not enough that can be said of Robbins' performance...although he has had better roles, never before or since has he portrayed his own emotions so nakedly. This is director Adrian Lyne's best by far, and by the way he's no slouch (Fatal Attraction, 9 1/2 Weeks).\n\nThis is not a horror movie as some may think, it is human drama masterfully disguised as a supernatural thriller. The basic elements of Jacob's Ladder have been plundered several times in recent years. We have been suckered by flashy films with clever plot twists that cheat us on story, characters, and technical excellence. This film delivers all that and more. Movies like this are set apart from the rest of the pack because you don't just watch stuff like this, you feel it too.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Jacob's Ladder", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2761031961", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjgyOTI1NDItNTViNS00ZjkzLWE0YTQtNDVjZjE2ZTI4ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjgyOTI1NDItNTViNS00ZjkzLWE0YTQtNDVjZjE2ZTI4ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:48:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000209/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tim Robbins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099871/characters/nm0000209?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jacob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000732/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Danny Aiello"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099871/characters/nm0000732?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Louis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0898546/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Pruitt Taylor Vince"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099871/characters/nm0898546?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0435678/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Patricia Kalember"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099871/characters/nm0435678?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000609/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ving Rhames"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099871/characters/nm0000609?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "George"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0018143/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Anthony Alessandro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099871/characters/nm0018143?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rod"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0580924/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "S.

A lot of empty reviews only giving 1 star due to \"explicit sexual content, and black men who does not respect the law\". \n\nWhat people does not seem to understand is that this is a movie about the rise, and fall of the biggest rap group ever, how they evolved and what power, money, and fame can to a man (and in this case, his relationship to his friends). As much as anything, this movie really is a lot about the abuse that a lot of black males experienced from the police in the 80's (which is still a very relevant topic).\n\nPersonally I am a big fan of N.W.A, without that being the reason I am rating this movie 9/10. It is a really interesting true story about some of THE great rap artists of our generation. Great performances by actors who looks a lot like the original group, as well as Paul Giamatti. Great directing, the movie has a really nice action curve, keeping things interesting throughout the movie, and really gives the public a good insight of the life of some of the biggest stars in the world during the 80's/90's. \n\nThis is the first time i have ever written an review on IMDb, even though I have a lot of strong opinions about movies, but I really had to come to this movies defence. This is one of those movies I am really expecting to see a 8,3 star rating or something similar, and it really frustrates me to see a lot of people giving this movie unnecessary hate. GREAT MOVIE, if you like N.W.A, it is really worth your while, and if you are not, it is still worth a watch just because of the really intriguing true story that \"Straight Out Of Compton\" is.\n\n9/10 movie\n\n11/10 will watch again", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2333454617", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwNzY1Nzk0MjNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDc4MzkzMTUx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwNzY1Nzk0MjNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDc4MzkzMTUx._V1_.jpg", "description": "The group NWA emerges from the streets of Compton, California in the mid-1980s and revolutionizes pop culture with their music and tales about life in the hood.", "uploadDate": "2015-04-03T04:31:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6578009/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "O'Shea Jackson Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1398426/characters/nm6578009?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ice Cube"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4207146/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1398426/characters/nm4207146?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eazy-E"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388038/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aldis Hodge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1398426/characters/nm0388038?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "MC Ren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3976974/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "R.

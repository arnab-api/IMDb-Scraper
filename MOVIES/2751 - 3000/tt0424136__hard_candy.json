It is a movie about Hayley (more than excellent Ellen Page) and Jeff, about pedophilia and about how a pedophile must feel. Or maybe it is only a history of vengeance. You won't know until the end of the film. It sure is a difficult subject for a movie, but the script is excellently profiled in the psychological horror and does not turn to be obscene or anything than can visually or verbally hurt the sensibility of anyone. It is more like disturbing to hear a teenage girl speak how she does, and it is fascinating how your feelings will go from one character to the other during the movie until you realize that no matter what the end is, everyone is guilty of something and it is not to us, humans, to decide what bad actions can be justified by other bad actions.\n\nTry on it, and be open-minded.\n\nSorry about any orthographic mistake, I'm not used to English writing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hard Candy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2217190937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY1MzVlYWUtOWNkZC00YjhiLThlZTItYjFlOGY0NWVmYmJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY1MzVlYWUtOWNkZC00YjhiLThlZTItYjFlOGY0NWVmYmJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Lionsgate", "uploadDate": "2013-05-04T04:15:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0933940/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Patrick Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0424136/characters/nm0933940?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeff Kohlver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0644897/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sandra Oh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0424136/characters/nm0644897?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Judy Tokuda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1058259/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "G.J.

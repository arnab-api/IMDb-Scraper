And I have to admit that the first time I saw this film I wasn't too enthused with it. But after I saw it a second time I fell in love with it and I now own it on video and have seen it quite a few more. And the reason is simple.\n\nFirst of all it is an excellent romance. Eddie really surprised me with his ability to write a story that actually had me touched. He is especially good as a player who gets played but actually falls in love. Murphy has shown a different side to him here and it is also one of his funnier films in quite some time. He is assisted in the comedy department here by two very funny guys, David Allan Grier and Martin Lawrence, the latter stealing every scene he is in.\n\nMartin Lawrence has never been as funny as he was in this film. He was great in Bad Boys, but his supporting turn here as Gerard is a classic. There is a true camaraderie here between the three friends (Murphy, Lawrence and Grier) and their conversation and actions around one another has the easy flow that longtime friends exhibit. They play jokes on each other, they make fun of each other and they are supportive of one another. But Lawrence has all the funny lines. From burning his dinner when his friends come over, to his hilarious observations about racism (the game of pool is racist because the white ball knocks the **** out of all the coloured balls, including the black one) to defending his unfortunate lack of lovemaking in the last few years, his interpretation of Tyler is just perfect.\n\nBoomerang is also blessed with a truly mellifluous soundtrack. With P.M. Dawn and Boyz To Men, among many of the stars, lending tracks to the film, it reminds me of the soundtrack to Last American Virgin in the sense that there are so many of today's superstars of music on the soundtrack. With Babyface producing, this is another winning production from him.\n\nBoomerang solidifies Eddie Murphy's return to the king of comedy. He did rebound nicely after this film and it is good to see him going back to what he knows. A very, very funny film.\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Boomerang", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1661973529", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U4ZDA4NzItZThmMi00NmU5LWI5ZDgtZDZiY2VhZTk1YmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U4ZDA4NzItZThmMi00NmU5LWI5ZDgtZDZiY2VhZTk1YmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2016-06-03T21:09:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000552/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eddie Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0000552?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Marcus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000932/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Halle Berry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0000932?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Angela"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001454/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Martin Lawrence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0001454?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390305/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Geoffrey Holder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0390305?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nelson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001674/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chris Rock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0001674?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bony T"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005375/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lela Rochon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0005375?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Christie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236858/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bebe Drake"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0236858?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mrs. Jackson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413778/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Leonard Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0413778?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Chemist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002101/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robin Givens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0002101?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jacqueline"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004979/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "David Alan Grier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0004979?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gerard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005063/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Grace Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0005063?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Strang\u00e9"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0457755/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eartha Kitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0457755?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lady Eloise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132896/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tisha Campbell-Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0132896?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Yvonne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0936762/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Witherspoon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0936762?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mr. Jackson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0855825/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John Canada Terrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103859/characters/nm0855825?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Todd"}]}]}

Johnson's chosen theme of Jewish traditional \"Orthodox\" customs in observing and respecting the dead (or loved ones) is a new pathway for the genre.\n\nThe story involves a young Brooklyn man, \"Yavoc\" (played by Dave Davis) who's dealing with the pains of growing up as a Millienial. Davis's good performance is what gives this feature its freshness, his character is socially odd -- single, economically disadvantaged and obviously feeling \"unloved\".\n\nThe film is about one night that he accepts to be a \"shomer\" for a home who just lost a family member. He is paid to stay, expected to pray whilst watching over the deceased body. \"Shomers\" traditionally are spiritually-trained, generational and in present time, are employed by some families.\n\nThen slowly throughout the night, a haunting begins. This is where this film does not depends solely on \"jump scares\" in delivering the chills. Here Johnson referrs to the Millienial popular lifestyle in using personal technology (with social media apps) to provide some of the supernatural elements.\n\nAgain, this isn't a film with typical tropes of a mainstream possession (or haunting) film, nor isn't a slow burner either. It deals with the theme of \"agony\", and is indicative in how Davis's character (alongwith the haunted) delved into his own tradegy. It loosely (and in general) deals with Jewish spiritual beliefs in \"good v.s. evil\".\n\nOne interesting element with this film, is its soundtrack and effects, sounding similar or reminiscent of two classic genre films: \"The Exorcist\" and \"Suspiria\". It's a strong debut from Johnson, awaiting for the next filmic production.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1365098777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWE1NGY5Y2ItMGQ4Zi00ZGRjLThiNjUtM2Q2Mjg4ZGViNjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWE1NGY5Y2ItMGQ4Zi00ZGRjLThiNjUtM2Q2Mjg4ZGViNjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Steeped in ancient Jewish lore and demonology, THE VIGIL is a supernatural horror film set over the course of a single evening in Brooklyn's Hasidic Borough Park neighborhood.

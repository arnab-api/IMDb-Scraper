Considering it clocks in at barely over two hours (compared to the marathonic three and a half of \"Samurai\"), it actually does a fantastic and very economical job of fleshing out its memorable cast of characters.\n\nOne particularly wonderful scene that stuck in my memory from the first time I saw the film ten years ago is the one where Lee (Robert Vaughn), drunk in the middle of the night, confesses his frailties and fear to two of the farmers. The scene (along with the general story of these down-and-out heroes) was groundbreaking in that it began the deconstruction and deromanticization of the Western hero which would be brought to fruition in Sergio Leone's unparalleled spaghetti Westerns.\n\nThe star-studded cast wouldn't hold up doing Shakespeare, but they're ideal in this gunslinging, cool-talking tough-guy adventure. As if a lineup of heroes that included Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn wasn't enough, Eli Wallach steals the show as the Mexican bandit chief, a worthy precursor to his classic role \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" If the screenplay has a major flaw, it's that his character isn't featured more.\n\nThe score is, of course, one of the all-time classics. And while not as alive visually as the Japanese film that inspired it or the Italian Westerns it influenced, it's still mighty fine to look at, and the gunfights don't disappoint.\n\nThe pieces add up to one of the great entertaining films of all time, which still manages to be moving and morally aware despite its Hollywoodization of Kurosawa's vision.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Magnificent Seven (1960)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2036504857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmJiNDhlOWYtMmRiZC00YzMzLWI0NTUtYzY5MTYwNWZjMTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmJiNDhlOWYtMmRiZC00YzMzLWI0NTUtYzY5MTYwNWZjMTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer B for The Magnificent Seven", "uploadDate": "2010-11-05T03:33:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000989/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Yul Brynner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0000989?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Larabee Adams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000537/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Steve McQueen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0000537?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vin Tanner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000314/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charles Bronson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0000314?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bernardo O'Reilly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0223290/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brad Dexter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0223290?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Harry Luck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0554830/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jorge Mart\u00ednez de Hoyos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0554830?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hilario"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0599478/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rosenda Monteros"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0599478?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Petra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0379473/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Pepe Hern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0379473?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tomas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0622956/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mario Navarro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0622956?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Boy with O'Reilly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0908919/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eli Wallach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0908919?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Calvera"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001976/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Horst Buchholz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0001976?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chico"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001816/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Robert Vaughn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0001816?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000336/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James Coburn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0000336?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Britt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0812453/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Vladimir Sokoloff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0812453?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Old Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0015976/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rico Alaniz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0015976?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sotero"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0882974/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Natividad Vac\u00edo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054047/characters/nm0882974?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Villager"}]}]}

So I watched Priest expecting little, but while it had a fair amount of problems with it I found it decent. Is it the best of year? No. The worst? Nowhere near for me. Priest in my mind is somewhere near the lower-middle of the spectrum.\n\nWhere Priest scores especially is in the costume and set design which look wonderful, and the photography and editing looks very slick and the lighting atmospheric. The soundtrack is excellent too, with a rather epic feel to it sometimes. I enjoyed the performances of Paul Bettany and Cam Gigandet, was intrigued somewhat by the characters, even if they are a little vacuous and found the direction decent.\n\nWhat wasn't so good was primarily the length, I personally think Priest was on the too-short side. Had the film been longer, the script could have been less choppy and underdeveloped and the story-though it did have an interesting concept to work from- less rushed and simplistic. Mostly I was impressed with the stylish look of the film, but I did occasionally find the effects on the artificial side.\n\nOverall, underdeveloped and rather rushed, but the film's look especially saves it. 6/10 Bethany Cox", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Priest: Trailer #3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4157250841", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjcwNzAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTM5NA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjcwNzAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTM5NA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A priest disobeys church law to track down the vampires who kidnapped his niece.", "uploadDate": "2011-04-14T07:01:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0079273/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Bettany"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0079273?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Priest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1544217/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cam Gigandet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm1544217?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hicks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2934314/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lily Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm2934314?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lucy Pace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0610459/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Stephen Moyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0610459?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Owen Pace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0197638/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alan Dale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0197638?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Monsignor Chamberlain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2624923/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jacob Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm2624923?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4426836/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Joel Polinsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm4426836?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dr. Tomlin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0106004/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jon Braver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0106004?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Familiar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0881631/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Karl Urban"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0881631?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Black Hat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0702572/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Maggie Q"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0702572?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Priestess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000374/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brad Dourif"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0000374?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Salesman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001626/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Christopher Plummer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0001626?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Monsignor Orelas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000749/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "M\u00e4dchen Amick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0000749?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shannon Pace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0282649/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dave Florek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0282649?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Crocker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0974594/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Josh Wingate"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0822847/characters/nm0974594?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Familiar"}]}]}

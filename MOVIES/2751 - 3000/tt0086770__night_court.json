The only time I've ever seen a show that featured a lot of slapstick and raunchy gags, unlike any other sitcom. Harry Anderson was Harry Stone, a zany judge who loved magic and silly props, which he would pull outta nowhere a lot of the time. In his court was my all time fave sitcom actor John Larroquette, as smutty Dan Fielding, a womanizing, outspoken district attorney. There was also well meaning but dumber than cotton Bull Shannon, a towering bailiff. These three were really the only ones who were around from the shows first episode. I'd have to say they may have set a record for most cast changes for a sitcom as there were at least 4(!) leading female characters. There was Karen Austin, Ellen Foley for a season, than a series of several replacement actresses for a few weeks before Markie Post finally grounded herself as the main female character. Also along midway through were Charles Robinson as Mac, Florence Hallop, who died shortly after joining the show, and she was replacing Selma Diamond who also passed away. Finally the producers went with a younger choice, Marsha Warfield as no nonsense Roz. Lots of great episodes, of mention the one where Harry's old college friend shows up. Anderson and Larroquette end up on a ledge nude which leads to the shows best line ever when one looks down at the others privates: \"So, what's up?\" They ended their run in 92 with an extremely disappointing show, which wrapped the characters fates nicely, but lacked any type of laughs at all. But still a terrific bunch of shows midway through the 80s make it one of the best, if edgiest, shows ever.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Night Court: Season 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3941514521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWUxMjQ4YjAtNzMzOS00OWQwLThmMzgtYmE1NGU2MjkyZjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWUxMjQ4YjAtNzMzOS00OWQwLThmMzgtYmE1NGU2MjkyZjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Night Court: Season 2", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T01:30:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0026789/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harry Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086770/characters/nm0026789?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Judge Harry T.

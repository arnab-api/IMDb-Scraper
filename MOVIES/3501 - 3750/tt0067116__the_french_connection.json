But prior to that, this was the movie that defined his career. It was the New Hollywood answer to film noir, and the lead male (Gene Hackman) is presented without glamour, the gritty city (New York) without dramatic shadows and light, and the plot (about modern drug dealing) without hyped up dramatics. This is a movie as down in the mouth as the world it represents, and it's all deliberate, and smart.\n\nThis is the stuff of a breakthrough movie. It isn't quite as gripping now, I think, but it still sucks you in. There are lots of scenes in cars, including the famous car chase, and lots of good old street stuff in Manhattan, very 1970 (when it was shot). The plot and pace of things is more steady than exciting, usually, not cinema verite but a kind of camera work that is unglamorous with the idea that this really is the way it is, and it works great. It would have been easy to push this farther and make it truly boring, but it doesn't go there. Instead we see the details of a couple of cops out to break a huge dope ring.\n\nMost of the movie (I'm going to guess three quarters) is simply the cops trailing the bad guys, on foot or by car. There are very brief interspersed personal dramas, and there are conversations that keep the plot clear, but the overall big vector here is one direction, and the cops get closer in spurts and jerks to their prey. The velocity does increase gradually in the second half, with a kind of brilliant building to a finale, and by the end it's a thrilling climax. \n\nIn a way, this kind of film is the exact opposite of something like \"Die Hard,\" which is all exaggeration and excess. And if those other kinds of movies are more fun, this is not only edgy, it's pertinent. And the music is by jazz great Don Ellis. Look for a scene with the World Trade Center towers under construction in the distance.\n\nCheck this film out. A special movie that actually reveals something about police life, hard core, no glitz.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The French Connection", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2196898073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM3YmY5NjUtMjI5MS00MjM1LTk4ZjktMjBlMDdlN2UxYTJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM3YmY5NjUtMjI5MS00MjM1LTk4ZjktMjBlMDdlN2UxYTJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The French Connection", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:43:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000432/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gene Hackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0000432?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jimmy Doyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001702/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Roy Scheider"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0001702?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Buddy Russo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0102566/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Marcel Bozzuffi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0102566?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Pierre Nicoli"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0382707/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bill Hickman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0382707?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mulderig"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308872/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harold Gary"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0308872?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Weinstock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0250670/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Eddie Egan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0250670?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Simonson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0343780/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sonny Grosso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0343780?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Klein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0567564/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Patrick McDermott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0567564?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Chemist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0721073/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Fernando Rey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0721073?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alain Charnier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0516215/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tony Lo Bianco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0516215?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sal Boca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0664687/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Pasquale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0664687?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Devereaux"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0714232/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ann Rebbot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0714232?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Marie Charnier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0112029/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Arlene Farber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0112029?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Angie Boca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0259666/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Ernotte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm0259666?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "La Valle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2174137/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Benny Marino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067116/characters/nm2174137?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lou Boca"}]}]}

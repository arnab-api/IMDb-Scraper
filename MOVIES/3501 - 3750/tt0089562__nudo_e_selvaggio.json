While Michele Massimo Trantini's film is definitely fun to watch, I am personally not too enthusiastic about it. What makes this film fun is both its incredible schlock-factor, and the fact that it combines elements from various sub-genres. While the film is obviously a Cannibal flick (and also marketed as such) it isn't anywhere near as disturbing as (nor otherwise comparable to) the genre classics by Umberto Lenzi and Ruggero Deodato. This film is more like a gory adventure/action film that includes Cannibals and even employs comedy elements.\n\nThe film actually begins like a silly 80s slapstick comedy, with goofy jokes, staged fistfights, stereotypical characters, and some female eye-candy. A bunch of drifters stranded in a Brazilian village all require a flight to a certain savage and 'forbidden' area in the Amazon jungle, the 'Dinosaur Valley' which is still inhabited by Cannibals. Needless to say that the slapstick comedy is soon over and the film turns into bloody survival exploitation. Still, the film is tame compared to almost all other Italian Cannibal flicks from the 80s.\n\nThe characters are eccentric and their actions often incredibly stupid, but the film is entertaining from start to finish (though never creepy or suspenseful let alone shocking). The highlight in the cast is obviously the ravishing Suzanne Carvalho, who plays Eva, the sexy daughter of a famous scientist. Michael Sopkiw (who might also be known to fans of Italian genre-cinema for playing the lead in Sergio Martino's \"2019 - After the Fall of New York\") is well-cast in the lead as a shotgun-wielding anthropologist. The rest of the characters include two luscious nude-models, a sleazy photographer and a married couple with slight marital problems - he is an insane 'Nam vet, she is an alcoholic pain in the ass who does not even stop annoying her husband and mocking his impotence once they are surrounded by hungry cannibals.\n\nThe film is fun enough to watch, but in my opinion, it is only recommendable to my fellow enthusiastic fans of Cannibal flicks and/or schlock Horror. Those who haven't seen any Cannibal films so far are well-advised to watch Ruggero Deodato's masterpiece \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (1980) followed either by Deodato's own \"Ultimo Mondo Cannibale\" (\"Last Cannibal World\" 1977) or Umberto Lenzi's \"Il Paese Del Sesso Selvaggio\" (\"Deep River Savages\", 1972), \"Mangiati Vivi\" (\"Eaten Alive By The Cannibals\", 1980) and \"Cannibal Ferrox\" (1981). When you've seen all the Deodato and Lenzi flicks, you can throw in this one, though there are still a few other Cannibal flicks that I'd probably recommend over \"Dinosaur Valley\". Unlike most other Cannibal flicks, this one doesn't involve any animal-killings, so some people might actually prefer it (though it probably isn't their genre in general). Overall, \"Massacre in Dinosaur Valley\" is highly entertaining, though nothing essential in my opinion.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0814679/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Sopkiw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089562/characters/nm0814679?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Hall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0736035/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Milton Rodr\u00edguez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089562/characters/nm0736035?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Capt.

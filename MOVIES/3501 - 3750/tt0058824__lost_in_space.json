It's pretty easy, because each season was very different from the others. The familiar characters included the Robinson family (John, Maureen, Judy, Penny, and precocious Will), the testy, short-tempered space pilot (Major Don West, played by Mark Goddard), the sinister, cowardly stowaway (Dr. Smith, played to perfection by Jonathan Harris), and of course the ship's robot, played by diminutive actor Bob May. The entire group took off in their ship Jupiter 2, and promptly got\u0085well, lost in space.\n\nThe first season (1965-66) was in B&W and was very dark and serious in tone. There were several very good guest stars (including Michael Rennie, Warren Oates, Kurt Russell, and others), decent special effects, and sober story lines. The first season also had a very subtle love affair between Judy (Marta Kristen) and Major West. Still, the first season, though well done, was pretty boring. How many times can Guy Williams fly around with that jet pack? \n\nThe second season (1966-67) was in color and was markedly lighter and sillier in tone. The infuriating thing about this season was that the Jupiter 2 seemed never to leave the ground! Many of the season's stories never really went anywhere, nor did they make much sense. There were lots of colorful characters and absurd situations, with a few standout episodes, including my all-time favorite \"Trip Through the Robot\".\n\nThe third season (1967-68) left all logic and coherence behind, emphasizing silly situations with Will (Billy Mumy) and Dr. Smith always in peril. This is my favorite season, since the stories are mostly so absurd that there's no way to take them seriously. The series' nadir was no doubt \"The Great Vegetable Rebellion\", in which a giant carrot terrorizes the giggling cast. However, this season also included \"The Anti-Matter Man\", which was imaginative, dark, and very disturbing at times.\n\nWith \"Lost in Space\", I suppose you either love it or hate it. I grew up with it, and I love it\u0085but I can certainly understand why some people would just despise it for its silliness. As a child of the 1960s, I guess it simply makes me feel young again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lost in Space :Season 1 (1965)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4069720345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDk4YmQxZGUtYzZjNi00ZDRlLWJkNzQtOWQ4MzdkNjg3MGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDk4YmQxZGUtYzZjNi00ZDRlLWJkNzQtOWQ4MzdkNjg3MGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:53:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930713/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Guy Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058824/characters/nm0930713?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Prof. John Robinson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 1965-1968"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0323813/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mark Goddard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058824/characters/nm0323813?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Maj.

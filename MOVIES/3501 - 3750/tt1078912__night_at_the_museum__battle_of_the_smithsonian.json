It's arguably better than the first.\n\nAlthough better on different levels\u0085The historic characters are not just new and improved but also come with a greater comic value. In what the film lacks in a relatively mundane storyline, it compensates with a wonderful underlying message/moral. There's also a love story again but what struck me as more potent was the greater bond that exists between the rest of the characters; Larry and Jedediah, Jedediah and Octavius etc. The score/music was noticeably better as well, very listenable. Of course the whole picture was far more 'epic' and I, for one, am a fan of this. On the face of this, its a comedy blended perfectly with action like a cocktail of strawberry and champagne \u2013 and very much like Tropic Thunder (although on a different level of course). Hank Azaria was brilliant as Kahmunrah especially in the way he could turn from serious evil to light-hearted joker in the blink of an eye. Speaking of which, him and his trio of evil helpers were fantastic together, as am sure you'll all agree.\n\nThe one downside is that too many of the best comedy moments were shown in the trailers, so kind of dampening the effect of many of the genuinely funny moments. But there's still enough to keep you chuckling away! So should there be a third? If they can continue to make people laugh whilst rummaging through their popcorn during the action scenes, I'd day why not? After all, what is life without a bit of fun?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian -- Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1663697689", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE1MDI2NTk1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyNjkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE1MDI2NTk1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyNjkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Security guard Larry Daley infiltrates the Smithsonian Institute in order to rescue Jedediah and Octavius, who have been shipped to the museum by mistake.", "uploadDate": "2009-02-19T15:58:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001774/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ben Stiller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0001774?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Larry Daley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005562/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Owen Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0005562?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jedediah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000245/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robin Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0000245?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Teddy Roosevelt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0149260/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alain Chabat"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0149260?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Napoleon Bonaparte"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0315041/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ricky Gervais"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0315041?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dr. McPhee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1256532/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jon Bernthal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm1256532?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Al Capone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1544084/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jake Cherry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm1544084?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nicky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0669693/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mizuo Peck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0669693?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sacajawea"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0010736/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Amy Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0010736?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Amelia Earhart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000279/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hank Azaria"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0000279?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kahmunrah"}, {"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0000279?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "The Thinker"}, {"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0000279?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abe Lincoln"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001302/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Christopher Guest"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0001302?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ivan the Terrible"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176869/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Steve Coogan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0176869?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Octavius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352778/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bill Hader"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0352778?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "George Armstrong Custer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0302466/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Patrick Gallagher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm0302466?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Attila the Hun"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1785339/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rami Malek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1078912/characters/nm1785339?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ahkmenrah"}]}]}

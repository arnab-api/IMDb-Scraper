But at the end I didn't feel like it was worth spending more time on.\n\nAlso, the evil plot introduced in the last couple of minutes just seems too ridiculous.\n\nAnyway, I guess it's worth checking out, at least.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Watch Now on Apple TV+", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2947399193", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMwNmRkMWMtMmUzNy00NWQwLTllMTgtMzZjYzdlMDBmMGY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMwNmRkMWMtMmUzNy00NWQwLTllMTgtMzZjYzdlMDBmMGY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-03-13T13:02:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4270695/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tituss Burgess"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm4270695?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cole Tillerman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1265802/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josh Gad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm1265802?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Birdie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1502434/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Leslie Odom Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm1502434?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Owen Tillerman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068338/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kristen Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm0068338?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Molly Tillerman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3082341/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eugene Cordero"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm3082341?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Brendan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0482851/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Phil LaMarr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm0482851?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Randy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4377526/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Daveed Diggs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm4377526?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Helen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1063517/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kathryn Hahn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm1063517?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Paige Hunter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001804/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Stanley Tucci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm0001804?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bitsy Brandenham"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0379114/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Herman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm0379114?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dmitry"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1721036/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rory O'Malley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8129006/characters/nm1721036?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Elwood"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}]}

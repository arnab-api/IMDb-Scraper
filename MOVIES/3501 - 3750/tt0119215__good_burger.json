I have pretty much memorized the movie and it is without a doubt my favorite movie. I have rented the movie, I don't know how many times, but I would have easily could have bought the movie about 20 times. No questions asked, Good Burger is the best movie that has been made. The humor is priceless, and and guy 23 years old and to be so immature, I think you can't get any funnier. Good Burger was out in 1997, was a hit, but I don't really for how long, and then was looked at as a stupid movie. I am here to prove those people wrong. Just watch the movie more and more and eventually understand the humor of this film. This feedback is to complement Nickelodean on an awesome movie. For people who already understand this type of humor, this movie is priceless. No other movie uses funny people who are in their twenties and people to get so frustrated because of their unintelligence, there is nothing that can beat it. To me, I think that this storyline is accurate and is actually realistic. The only thing that I think is questionable is the personality of Ed. Dexter is an appropriate character. He acts as if something really happened and to me, I think that this is what a normal person would do. Get mad at Ed but then, the funny personality of Ed, re-uniting the friendship.\n\nMy favorite part was when Ed is talking to Kurt in his car and Kurt is trying to persuade Ed to tell him the secret recipe. \"how does, 10 bucks sound?\" Ed- \"I dunno, It sorta sounds like crush crush, crush.\" about a minute later \"i'm Kurt\" \"I'Ed\" \"I'm aware\" \" I thought you said you were Kurt!\" \n\nIt's impossible for me not to laugh at that part. It's so funny. \n\nIn the end, people might think that it is a movie for an immature audience and made for little kids, but in reality, all you have to do is watch the movie more and more, and soon enough, you will understand the humor and know what what the movie is actually about."}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2678303513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzM5MTQzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODIzOTQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzM5MTQzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODIzOTQyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two dim-witted teenage boys are forced to save the fast-food restaurant they work at from going out of business, despite a new-and-improved burger joint opening across the street that want to be the \"Top Dog\" in the fast food industry.", "uploadDate": "2014-01-22T16:43:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005239/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kel Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0005239?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005435/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sinbad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0005435?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mr. Wheat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005046/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Shar Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0005046?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Monique"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0777810/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jan Schweiterman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0777810?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kurt Bozwell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785805/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Josh Server"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0785805?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Fizz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004802/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Linda Cardellini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0004802?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Heather"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1093741/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "George Clinton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm1093741?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dancing Crazy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0943237/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Wuhl"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0943237?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Angry Customer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0860380/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kenan Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0860380?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dexter Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001820/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abe Vigoda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0001820?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Otis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0773759/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dan Schneider"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0773759?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Baily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0504516/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ron Lester"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0504516?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Spatch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0775238/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ginny Schreiber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0775238?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Deedee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0641944/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Shaquille O'Neal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0641944?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Shaquille O'Neal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0354469/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Richard Haje"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119215/characters/nm0354469?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Huge Scary Man"}]}]}

Seems to me any male would want to see it. The viewer cannot help but love her character in this movie. Motherhood and marriage must agree with her, as she has never looked better.\n\nOf course the storyline is quite fantastic and not very realistic. But who cares? I get up in the morning to face reality every day. I don't need to see too much of it at the movies.\n\nMark Rufalo did a fine job of acting, but to me it was Reese's movie all the way. I wonder why our movie critics and voters for Oscars and such don't give much weight to comedic actors and actresses? It takes just as much talent, and actually there are in my estimation less who really pull off comedic roles well. Reese Witherspoon has done it many times, and doesn't disappoint here. Most modern so-called comedies to me are simply not funny. However, this movie did make me laugh. The guy who works in the psychic bookstore was hilarious. \n\nBut this movie isn't all about comedy. It does touch at the heartstrings of any member of the human race who feels left out, feels like they are missing it. Usually a movie has one person who the viewer can really relate to. In this case, both leads played people who I could relate to.\n\nIf constant special effects, extreme violence, streams of foul language, or total realism are for you, then perhaps you should skip this movie. For the rest of us who can enjoy a romantic comedy, I can't imagine not being entertained by this movie. I left it feeling great.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Just Like Heaven", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3482517785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjVlNmYzZTMtYTkwZC00OWExLWEyZmYtYWMzMTk0YjcxMzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjVlNmYzZTMtYTkwZC00OWExLWEyZmYtYWMzMTk0YjcxMzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:53:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000702/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Reese Witherspoon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0000702?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elizabeth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006610/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Donal Logue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0006610?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0791570/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ben Shenkman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0791570?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0587431/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ivana Milicevic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0587431?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Katrina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001034/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rosalind Chao"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0001034?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Fran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308606/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Willie Garson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0308606?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Maitre D'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1173656/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "William Caploe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm1173656?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nurse Bill"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0065084/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Billy Beck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0065084?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mr. Clarke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0749263/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mark Ruffalo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0749263?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005457/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dina Spybey-Waters"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0005457?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1417647/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jon Heder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm1417647?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Darryl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000715/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Caroline Aaron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0000715?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Grace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0133474/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ron Canada"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0133474?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dr. Walsh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0268124/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gabrielle Made"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0268124?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nurse Maria"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0184736/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Shulie Cowen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425123/characters/nm0184736?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nurse Jenny"}]}]}

Ricardo Montauban,  a classic actor best known for his romantic films in his early years, 1950's.  One of the best villains you will ever see in a science fiction movie.\n\nThe music was good, however not as good as the predecessor movie's music, but still good.  The directing is also very good, great use of focusing techniques, close up's, action sequences well done, the usual high standard that comes from a proficient director like Nicholas Meyer.\n\nThe lighting, exterior and interior shots, were well done.\n\nIts a pity that they haven't made a remastered tape, as the movie picture quality has degraded through the years.\n\nWilliam Shatner's acting was extremely real, moving, believable. Among with the other main cast, and unlike the previous movie, this movie brought together that atmosphere that existed in the Original Star trek series.\n\nThe dramatic plot that happens towards the end of the movie is indeed, one of the best scenes you will ever see in motion picture history.  Proving that Star Trek still has emotion.  I can not be more clearer than this unless by giving away the story.  Watch it yourself, and you'll be moved by the greatest acting, heart touching scene ever made.\n\nThe special effects composed along with George Lucas were excellent, and in the year 2000, I feel they would come very close to our standard today.  The better warp entering sequences, battle sequences, and the formation of the new Genesis planet are very good effects.  The chase in the nebula, final explosion of the Genesis device are effects for you to watch for.\n\nIf your like me, you will love the script for its Shakespeare context which Khan uses effectively throughout the film. I highly recommend you to see this movie if you haven't already, it's one of the best.\n\nRating: 9.5/10"}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: Celebrating 50 Years", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1234417433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWEwMDY5YjAtZTk2Yy00MDQ0LTgxNjAtNTA4MjFjZjFkOTg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWEwMDY5YjAtZTk2Yy00MDQ0LTgxNjAtNTA4MjFjZjFkOTg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Wrath Of Khan Director's Cut", "uploadDate": "2016-06-28T14:49:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000638/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William Shatner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0000638?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kirk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001420/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "DeForest Kelley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0001420?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "McCoy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000479/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Walter Koenig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0000479?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chekov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0629667/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nichelle Nichols"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0629667?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Uhura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0125190/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Merritt Butrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0125190?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000263/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kirstie Alley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0000263?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Saavik"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0252055/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ike Eisenmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0252055?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Preston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935604/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Winston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0935604?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000559/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Leonard Nimoy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0000559?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Spock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001150/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James Doohan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0001150?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Scotty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001786/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "George Takei"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0001786?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sulu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000935/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bibi Besch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0000935?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Carol"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0934902/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Paul Winfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0934902?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Terrell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001544/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ricardo Montalban"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0001544?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Khan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0889855/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John Vargas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0084726/characters/nm0889855?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jedda"}]}]}

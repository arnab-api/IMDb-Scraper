That being said, this review will try to be fair. Hopefully.\n\nFirst off, \"The Thing\" is a prequel. I always have a fascination of prequels because they have a unique approach to writing in that the events must lead up logically to a movie already made rather than taking the idea of the first movie and going in different directions with it. This creates a lot of confinement and there have been some really cool prequels that, even in this confinement, still feel fresh and take whatever franchise into a new direction (case in point, From Dusk Til Dawn 3). So already, this movie has both a reputation to live up to (the 1982 movie is very highly regarded by John Carpenter fans, horror fans and even fans of good drama and story telling) and adding in the fact that the writers must somehow lead up to the original movie is a tough task to undertake. Overall, it was a valiant effort...but missed the mark.\n\nThe entire concept of the monster of this movie is that it dissolves any sort of trust between people. When these people are in a confined location like Antarctica, it becomes a boiler room situation with wills being tested, fears being escalated and the overall sense of any safety even with someone you've known for a while completely in chaos. I feel that this Thing movie missed that sense of despair, confinement and overall breakdown of the relationships between colleagues and comrades and even enemies when a shape shifting impostor is thrown into the mix. This is made blatantly evident when over half the characters don't seem worthy of care by the audience. Most have no personality to connect to, and the sheer number of characters just makes it worse to get to know these people. So when they start dropping like flies, one really doesn't care a whole lot. \n\nAnd really, that's the fundamental flaw with the movie and why the whole thing feels forced. The pacing wasn't as deliberately slow, the whodunnit aspect didn't feel properly in place, and finally...and again, this criticism is as a fan of the original movie...why on earth did the thing not try to hide more than it did? At one point, it seemed like the movie shifted gears into a simple monster movie with *insert beastly monster* just running around killing which was completely uncharacteristic of the original movie where the thing, even when found out, would try to make an escape to hide again...\n\nSo in all, as a standalone movie, it wasn't bad at all. It was a nice return to gory disgusting things that go bump in the dark. But as a prequel, it missed the mark I think the film makers were trying to hit. John Carpenter laid out a very specific and deliberate tone to the original movie that this one just couldn't seem to figure out how to replicate...no blood test needed to find this impostor."}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2985204761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzUzMzg1NDU2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI0OTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzUzMzg1NDU2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI0OTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "At an Antarctica research site, the discovery of an alien craft leads to a confrontation between graduate student Kate Lloyd and scientist Dr. Sander Halvorson.", "uploadDate": "2011-07-19T13:18:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935541/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mary Elizabeth Winstead"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0935541?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kate Lloyd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0860947/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ulrich Thomsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0860947?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Sander Halvorson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0015382/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0015382?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jameson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0782627/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Trond Espen Seim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0782627?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Edvard Wolner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0486433/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "J\u00f8rgen Langhelle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0486433?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lars"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388732/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Stig Henrik Hoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0388732?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3843625/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jo Adrian Haavind"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm3843625?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Henrik"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0907896/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jonathan Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0907896?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Colin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0249291/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joel Edgerton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0249291?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0647638/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Eric Christian Olsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0647638?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Adam Finch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0105951/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paul Braunstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0105951?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Griggs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1384265/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kim Bubbs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm1384265?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Juliette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0754031/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jan Gunnar R\u00f8ise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0754031?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Olav"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1970465/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kristofer Hivju"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm1970465?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jonas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0085079/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Carsten Bj\u00f8rnlund"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0905372/characters/nm0085079?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Karl"}]}]}

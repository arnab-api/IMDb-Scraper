Based on the unbelievable true story and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, the at times bizarre film tells the story of Michael Peterson, played by Hardy, who robs a post office in 1974, to only get 26 pounds out of the deal, and is sentenced to four years in prison. A four year stay has turned into a thirty-four year prison term, thirty of which has been spent in solitary confinement.\n\nThe man, which the British press calls 'the most violent prisoner in Britain,\" is one of the most complex, and highly disturbing characters to be depicted on screen this year. He always wanted to famous, Hardy states with such charisma at the opening of the film, but he can't sing, he can't dance, so he creates an alter ego during his time as a boxer prior to his prison sentence. Though the film is loosely based on the real man and his story, it doesn't matter, Refn treats the film with such artistic integrity and takes chances that most directors hope to accomplish in their careers. The narrative, though over-whelming at times, is unyielding in the manner in which it's told. For the most part however, Tom Hardy's gritty and aggressive performance will go down as one of the best kept secrets of 2009.\n\nIn watching the picture, the co-stars are nearly invisible as Hardy takes control of the screen and your attention. He enables the viewer to devote their time and energy with fear of severe consequences in not doing so. Hardy is an incredible talent and not sure if you'll see a more devoted actor to a character on film this year.\n\nRefn's choice of music that fills the scenes with torment, discomfort, and sheer violence is a brilliance shown in his armor. Bronson is pure entertainment, and though it doesn't provide any moral or social significance in the acts of our lives, it's an admiral effort by British cinema.\n\n***/****", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bronson", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1194066457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRhOWU5YmUtYWM5Ni00ZTUzLWFiNmQtN2FhNzk1MDAyNmNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRhOWU5YmUtYWM5Ni00ZTUzLWFiNmQtN2FhNzk1MDAyNmNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg", "description": "A biopic of notorious British criminal Charles Bronson.", "uploadDate": "2009-08-25T07:27:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0362766/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Hardy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm0362766?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charles Bronson"}, {"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm0362766?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Peterson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1568589/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Luing Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm1568589?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hysterical Screw"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1446625/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gordon Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm1446625?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Screw"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1111560/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mark Devenport"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm1111560?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nurse 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0285291/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Andrew Forbes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm0285291?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Charlie's Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0455057/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Matt King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm0455057?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paul Daniels"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1528036/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Holly Lucas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm1528036?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0680526/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jonny Phillips"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm0680526?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Prison Governor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1433549/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kelly Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm1433549?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Irene"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3032715/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Katy Barker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm3032715?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Julie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0123511/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Amanda Burton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm0123511?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Charlie's Mum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1807654/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Paul Donnelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm1807654?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Screw"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396675/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jon House"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm0396675?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Webber"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0484202/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "James Lance"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm0484202?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Phil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2957851/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Juliet Oldfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1172570/characters/nm2957851?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alison"}]}]}

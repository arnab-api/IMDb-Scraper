This film totally annihilates all the trashy \"straight-to-video\" horror films.  Based on true events in 17th century France, this film is one of the most horrifying tales of man's intolerance: religious and sexual.\n\nThe tale begins with an outbreak of the plague, which the folk of the middle ages, with typical misunderstanding of the real cause, rat fleas, believed that someone was to blame. Who more convenient a scapegoat than Father Grandier, played by the notorious Oliver Reed an actor who ended his rambunctious life by dropping dead in a bar.  The sexual appeal of Fr. Grandier drives the supposedly celibate clergy into a frenzy of jealousy. A group of nuns, led by a noblewoman who has been forced into the convent due to her physical deformity and therefore, lack of marriageable options, joins in the hysteria which is not satisfied until Fr. Grandier is burned at the stake.\n\nAlthough set in France in the middle ages, a lot of the hysteria can be seen today, in our more enlightened times. Just witness the periodic witch hunts in the United States, such as the furore over the alleged Satanic cults running day care centers, not to mention the reds under the beds hysteria of the 50's.\n\nThis was one of Ken Russell's most controversial films, and definitely very 70's in its style, after all, we had Mick Jagger and Twiggy perfectly cast as decadent French nobility, and it has taken 20+ years to see how right on the mark he was.\n\nAlthough Russell was the hottest thing in cinema for a while, he faded like a discarded fashion as every wannabe copied his style, but without being able to understand what is was that set Ken Russell apart.  Unfortunately Russell did not help his reputation by becoming more and more the icon of bad taste.  Eventually he became a parody and the fickle who had formally worshipped his genius could not disassociate themselves quickly enough.\n\nLike Orson Welles, Ken Russell's brilliance will not be realized until a new generation discovers his work.  I recommend \"The Devils\" along with \"The Music Lovers\" as his best work."}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000603/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vanessa Redgrave"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0000603?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sister Jeanne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0840303/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dudley Sutton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0840303?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Baron De Laubardemont"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428121/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gemma Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0428121?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Madeleine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331788/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Gothard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0331788?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Father Barre"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0614120/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Brian Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0614120?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Adam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035505/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Graham Armitage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0035505?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Louis XIII"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269026/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Andrew Faulds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0269026?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rangier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0661585/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Judith Paris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0661585?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sister Judith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001657/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Oliver Reed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0001657?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Urbain Grandier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0012451/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Max Adrian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0012451?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ibert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0578527/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Murray Melvin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0578527?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mignon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0354914/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Georgina Hale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0354914?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Philippe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0517787/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Christopher Logue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0517787?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cardinal Richelieu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940892/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Woodvine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0940892?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Trincant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0171829/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kenneth Colley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066993/characters/nm0171829?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Legrand"}]}]}

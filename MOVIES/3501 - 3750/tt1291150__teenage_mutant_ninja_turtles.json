Instead of the far east style of mutual cold looks and \"Yaaa!\" yells, while the tough good guy fights a cruel enemy, you get these \"karate kids\" who are in fact mutants and they fight the almost super-human villain. \n\nYou get the tension of they having to hide in the sewers as they are still being feared by us - regular people - and the realization that as much as we admire them we also want them on the research table. Add to that the character of April - a journalist who finds herself in triangle of conflict (up yours Louise Lane!): a journalist who uncovers secrets, the confident of the turtles and (in a way) the role of the mother, who would rush to danger to help them and protect them. \n\nThis could be a great platform for a good deep movie heavily spiced with great ninja action. But instead what did we get...\n\n1) An absurdly idiotic storyline which kinda gives you the feeling that the story writing was revolving around the already shot action scenes.\n\n2) Action sequences which appear to be copy paste from transformers and only replaced by turtles (I don't count shredder as he always looked like a robot).\n\n3) The role of April is basically something I would put in \"Little Pony\", which is reduced to nothing more then a brain dead, incoherent (she's a goddamn reporter for crying out loud!) and basically doesn't contribute anything to the good cause.\n\nOn the plus side: \n\n1) It was nice that they emphasized the uniqueness of each turtle beyond the color of the head band. Their entire gear is crafted to their different personalities.\n\n2) In the past movies or TV series they were always turtles fighting in human style, in here for the first time they make use of their physical turtle attributes.\n\nBottomline, this movie could have been so much better, and it feels like it was a wasted opportunity. a reboot I might watch, but if there is a number 2 on the way, then yeah...I'm not giving it another 2 hours of my life.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi295480345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjczMjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM3NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjczMjQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM3NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Darkness has settled over New York City as Shredder and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip on everything from the police to the politicians.

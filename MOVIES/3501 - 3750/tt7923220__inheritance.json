I watched it without knowing what it was about. When I saw the Morgan character, at first I was skeptical that they chose Simon Pegg for it. But he proves me wrong, boy was he a delight to watch in this role. This movie is the kind that you'd find yourself enjoy it more IF you can ignore the plot holes. Picture tom & jerry's holey cheese, those are the exact representation of the plot holes. So thats what I did, I ignore them and enjoy the performance. Well but then again there's only so much that mr.Pegg can do. This movie HAD a potential to become better, but the choppy edit and poor conclusion at the end render this movie into a meh.\n\nAnd as for lily collins, she gave great performance here, its solid. I just... cant helped but feel that someone else would've suited more to be the lead role. She didn't have the charisma nor the tenacity that was needed to play the no nonsense District Attorney.\n\nI like the first 50minutes of this movie, the revelation at the end just felt forced and rushed, all that build up doesn't really paid well. I just wished they take it to another direction instead of the cliche ending.\n\n5 star for the story, as it could've been great 7 star for Simon Pegg, I hope this is a sign that he's gonna play more serious roles in the future because he steals the show!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2559819289", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRmMzZkNjMtZWYzZi00ZWEwLThhNDctMTIxYjNiNWQ4MTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRmMzZkNjMtZWYzZi00ZWEwLThhNDctMTIxYjNiNWQ4MTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A patriarch of a wealthy and powerful family suddenly passes away, leaving his wife and daughter with a shocking secret inheritance that threatens to unravel and destroy their lives.", "uploadDate": "2020-03-19T22:49:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2934314/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lily Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7923220/characters/nm2934314?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lauren Monroe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001567/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Connie Nielsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7923220/characters/nm0001567?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Catherine Monroe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0911320/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patrick Warburton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7923220/characters/nm0911320?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Archer Monroe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004729/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Beach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7923220/characters/nm0004729?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Harold Thewlis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11063673/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alec James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7923220/characters/nm11063673?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Young Morgan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10141085/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mariyah Francis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7923220/characters/nm10141085?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Claire Monroe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8478730/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lucas Alexander Ayoub"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7923220/characters/nm8478730?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Eddie Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4910435/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jim E.

We were forced to watch the episode where Tia and Tamera give into peer pressure and start smoking in the school bathroom; it's real life issues that made \"Sister, Sister\" genuine in its hayday.\n\nThis was about five years ago and I hadn't seen the show since, until this summer. Though it's immediately proceeded on Disney by \"That's So Raven,\" it makes for one of the best hours on children's television in my opinion, even though I'm 18 and have long since given up on today's children's programming.\n\n\"Sister, Sister\" is funny in a way that's mature and adult without being too tacky or silly; a lot of today's kid's programming is idiotic toilet humor and is therefore complete crap. At least when I was growing up in the early 90s, we had cartoons that were genuinely funny and intelligent; if anything else, you might have actually learned something from them.\n\nI've watched several episodes and I'm amazed at how great a show about identical twin sisters can be, that it's funny, touching, AND intelligent - all at the same time and without selling its soul. \"Sister, Sister\" was entertaining for these very reasons and I'm sure that's why it lasted for as long as it did on television.\n\nIt's a great show, and one that I hope is released on DVD soon so that it can be experienced to its greatest."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2757279257", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZkNzE2ZDUtN2M2MC00MGE4LWIwYzAtYTM4MjBkZmQ2OTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZkNzE2ZDUtN2M2MC00MGE4LWIwYzAtYTM4MjBkZmQ2OTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Tia Landry and Tamera Campbell are twins separated at birth who learn of each other's existence and come together as teenagers.", "uploadDate": "2020-08-14T09:02:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0610298/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tia Mowry-Hardrict"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108927/characters/nm0610298?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tia Landry"}, {"url": "#", "name": "119 episodes, 1994-1999"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364068/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jack\u00e9e Harry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108927/characters/nm0364068?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lisa Landry"}, {"url": "#", "name": "119 episodes, 1994-1999"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396867/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Marques Houston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108927/characters/nm0396867?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Roger Evans"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 1994-1999"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005255/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tamera Mowry-Housley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108927/characters/nm0005255?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tamera Campbell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "119 episodes, 1994-1999"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005347/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tim Reid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108927/characters/nm0005347?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ray Campbell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "119 episodes, 1994-1999"}]}]}

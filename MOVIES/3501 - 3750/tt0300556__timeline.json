The book \"Timeline\" (or \"Tijdlijn\" in Dutch) is a very entertaining novel about the concept of traveling through time and a large company known as ITC trying to make money out of it. It packs a lot of action and tries to explain the issues surrounding time travel well enough. So anyone who read the book and liked it... SHOULD STAY THE HECK AWAY from this movie, because there's a big chance it turns out as a big disappointment. \n\nWhy? Because the movie tries to simplify the plot and put a big emphasis on action. Away with the part about ITC working on a way ter commercialize time travel. Let's just say they erm... discovered it by accident! Also throw out that part about speaking Old English and Aquitanian language in the 14th Century. Let's just say they all speak fluently English and/or French. In the book the only persons who could literally understand the people in 1357 were Marek and Edward Jones. The others had to use a special earpiece with a translator inside. But that's too difficult, so let's throw in someone else who DOES speak French. Oh and that storyline surrounding Lady Claire is much too complicated. Let's cut out Guy de Malagant (who tries to marry her in the book) and just make her Arnaut's sister. And whatever you do, don't let Chris get too close to her (in the book it was Chris who met Lady Claire first and falls in love with her, but she liked Marek more)\n\nThen the characters: the talents of Billy Connolly (Edward Jones), David Thewlis (Robert Doniger) and Frances O'Connor (Kate Ericson) are totally wasted. And I refuse ter comment on Paul \"2 Fast 2 Bloody Furious\" Walker as Chris Johnston. Nondedju, what a bloody plank of an actor he is! I'm more satisfied with Gerard Butler as Andr\u00e9 Marek, although I didn't like the fact his nationality was changed (Marek was a Dutchman in the book). Also doing a good job more or less were Marton Csokas and Anna Friel. Friel is looking very good as Lady Claire and Csokas has far too less screen time to properly portray Robert De Kere (or Rob Deckard as called in the book).\n\nSimplifying the plot of the book ter make it look good on screen actually made this film look bad. It might offer some entertainment if you never heard of the book, but if you read the book, then don't go see this movie!\n\nRating: 2/10 (It was pretty terrible)\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe Path chosen is never a trampled Road"}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Timeline", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3170304281", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRjOWJlMWMtZDI4NC00N2QxLTllYzItOWYzOGJlNzNiM2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRjOWJlMWMtZDI4NC00N2QxLTllYzItOWYzOGJlNzNiM2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:59:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0908094/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0908094?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Johnston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124930/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gerard Butler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0124930?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Andre Marek"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000667/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Thewlis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0000667?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robert Doniger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0568180/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Neal McDonough"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0568180?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Frank Gordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0256121/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ethan Embry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0256121?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Josh Stern"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0933727/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lambert Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0933727?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lord Arnaut"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1160472/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rossif Sutherland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm1160472?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Dontelle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0478640/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "David La Haye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0478640?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arnaut's Deputy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640323/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Frances O'Connor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0640323?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate Ericson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0175262/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Billy Connolly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0175262?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Professor Johnston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0295484/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anna Friel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0295484?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lady Claire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002023/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Matt Craven"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0002023?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Steven Kramer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0790688/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Michael Sheen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0790688?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lord Oliver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0190744/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Marton Csokas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0190744?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sir William De Kere"}, {"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0190744?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "William Decker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0434676/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Steve Kahan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0300556/characters/nm0434676?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Baker"}]}]}

It's as if he's found a different gear in his talent. This movie is powerful and strangely necessary as a result of current times. Well made and there is so much unknown talent in this movie on camera and off and one of the reasons I praised Johnny for a mature performance was because he made those around him go up a gear. Sometimes you can sense competition between actors in award contending movies but Johnny allowed others to shine as well as shining himself to a very high standard perhaps his best performance in years.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1552466201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBkMzk0OTctOTQ4ZC00YTU3LTgwOTItYjZkN2M1ZmQzMjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBkMzk0OTctOTQ4ZC00YTU3LTgwOTItYjZkN2M1ZmQzMjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "New York, 1971. Following his celebrated days as one of the most revered photojournalists of World War II, W. Eugene Smith (Johnny Depp) has become a recluse, disconnected from society and his career.

There, Smith immerses himself in the community, documenting their efforts to live with Minamata Disease and their passionate campaign to achieve recognition from Chisso and the Japanese government. Armed with only his trusted camera, Smith's images from the toxic village give the disaster a heartbreaking human dimension, and his initial assignment turns into a life-changing experience.", "uploadDate": "2020-10-08T16:53:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9179096/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "W.

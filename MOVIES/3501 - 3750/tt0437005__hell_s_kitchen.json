I'm not sure which episodes of which seasons i was watching, but i saw about four, and i wanted to post this simply in defense of \"chef.\" He's really not being such a jerk. Anyone who has had any experience in food AT ALL should be downright shocked that a single one of the contestants considers themselves anywhere remotely near competent. If I'm not mistaken, every one of the contestants has worked in a restaurant or graduated from a cooking school. I'm dumbfounded. These people are absolute, unequivocal, idiots, and the true pleasure of this show (and yes, true pleasure can be found) is in watching them make complete fools of themselves. Ramsay entered into a bad deal when he signed this contract. The prospect of one of these dolts running the restaurant of a serious chef has got to be a painful one for him even if he's making boatloads of cash off of it. He has every reason to yell his head off.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hell's Kitchen: Winner Chosen", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2010299417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUwMzM3Y2YtZDRkZC00NGQ0LWI2ZGYtMTkxZDhjYzQ1YmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUwMzM3Y2YtZDRkZC00NGQ0LWI2ZGYtMTkxZDhjYzQ1YmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Hell's Kitchen: Winner Chosen", "uploadDate": "2019-05-18T13:06:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1451059/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gordon Ramsay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0437005/characters/nm1451059?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Chef"}, {"url": "#", "name": "311 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3940907/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Andi Van Willigan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0437005/characters/nm3940907?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Self - Sous Chef"}, {"url": "#", "name": "156 episodes, 2010-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0860266/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jason Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0437005/characters/nm0860266?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Narrator"}, {"url": "#", "name": "227 episodes, 2005-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1994635/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Scott Leibfried"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0437005/characters/nm1994635?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Self - Sous Chef"}, {"url": "#", "name": "143 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}]}

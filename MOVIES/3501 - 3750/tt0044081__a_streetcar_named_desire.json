It's astonishing how much of a punch this movie still has after all these years. This just goes to show what a true genius Tennessee Williams really was. The characters he wrote, with all their own complexities and contradictions, and the script with its haunting poetry and now iconic lines are all classic. \n\nBut what good is a great script without great actors? Well, luckily, the cast couldn't have been better. Here we have a young Marlon Brando as the brutish Stanley Kowalski, who is truly ferocious in the role. We then have Kim Hunter who gives a great performance as the weak-willed Stella. Stella is the most likeable character in the movie for all she wants is for everyone to get along. Karl Malden is equally great as Mitch, who is seemingly weak and simple and serves as a contrast to Stanley's brutality. Then we have Vivien Leigh as Blanche DuBois. As I said above, I believe Leigh's performance here to be the greatest ever to be committed to film and here's why- Blanche DuBois is probably one of the most complicated characters ever written. She's a compulsive liar, who lives in a world of her own, choosing to create her own reality rather than acknowledge her bleak surroundings. She's a snob, a hypocrite and a user but at the same time she's an underdog who's had a tough life and just wants to be loved. Tennessee Williams himself said of Vivien's performance that 'she brought everything I intended to the role and even much more than I had dared dream of' which pretty much sums up her performance here. She truly gives herself to the darkness of Blanche DuBois, she's unpredictable, tormented and haunting while still somehow sympathetic. Through Leigh's mastery of her character we see that Blanche is really just a daffodil in a windstorm rather than a bad person. Every time I watch this film I notice a new nuance in her performance, whether it's a look in her eye that I hadn't noticed before or a change in her voice as Blanche lets her mask slip- never has there been such a true embodiment of a character.\n\nSo all this considered, with Kazan's brilliant direction, great cinematography and the unique \"jazzy\" score, is why I consider 'A Streetcar Named Desire' one of the greatest films ever made. It's not a film for everyone- it's heavy from the start, it's quite talky and most of the film takes place within the Kowalski's apartment but if you want a movie with brilliant acting and a dark, poetic script then there's no better film than this.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "A Streetcar Named Desire", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3668492057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA3YmQ0ZDEtZWRmNC00ZjYwLTg3YjAtOTQyNWZmMzdkMjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDA3YmQ0ZDEtZWRmNC00ZjYwLTg3YjAtOTQyNWZmMzdkMjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-09-10T17:16:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000046/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vivien Leigh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0000046?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Blanche DuBois"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001375/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kim Hunter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0001375?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stella Kowalski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0094036/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rudy Bond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0094036?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Steve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0384976/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Peg Hillias"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0384976?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Eunice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308257/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Richard Garrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0308257?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "A Doctor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0858777/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Edna Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0858777?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "The Mexican Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marlon Brando"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0000008?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stanley Kowalski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001500/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Karl Malden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0001500?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mitch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0219528/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nick Dennis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0219528?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Pablo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0455389/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wright King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0455389?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "A Collector"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0220280/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ann Dere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0220280?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "The Matron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0474139/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mickey Kuhn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0044081/characters/nm0474139?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "A Sailor"}]}]}

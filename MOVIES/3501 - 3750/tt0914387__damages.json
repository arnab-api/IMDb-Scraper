All I can say is bring on season two! I missed the show when it originally aired and read about it later. I was fortunate enough to download the complete season although it took some doing.\n\nTruthfully the reason I was uninterested in the show originally was because I've never been able to warm up to Glen Close since Fatal Attraction. Not an unusual reaction I guess. But I am so glad I finally got over my aversion to her which was based only on a character she played.\n\nShe is in fact a terrific actor, as is Rose Byrne who plays Ellen Parsons.\n\nI cannot compliment this show enough. It was a real surprise to me. I have always enjoyed legal dramas but this is so much more. It is a thriller really and different from other legal ensemble shows which concentrate on courtroom drama. This one never enters the courtroom.\n\nStarting at the end and working back in flashbacks it is so interesting. Like a giant puzzle which you put together piece by piece. By the end most of the pieces are in place. Enough to make you feel very satisfied.\n\nHowever, there are still enough little pieces left out to start a new puzzle for season 2. So as I said \"bring on season 2 asap\".\n\nOne last thing. Ted Danson as Arthur Frobisher was great as well. Played with understated evil I found this to be his best role ever.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who likes a show which requires thinking and concentration.\n\nCongratulations to the producers, writers, cast and crew.

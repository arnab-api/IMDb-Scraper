Von Stauffenberg is the closest figure Germany has to a national hero during World War 2. It's surprising that it took so long for a film to be made, nor to be a German film.\n\nValkyrie is a test project for the newly reformed United Artists under Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. It was also a smaller project for Bryan Singer after doing 3 superhero films and reunite Singer and Christoper McQuarrie for the first time after the Usual Suspects.\n\nValkyrie starts with a prelogue sequence in North Africa. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a disaffected officer who is questioning Hitler's regime and that he was leading Germany to the path of destruction. During a British air raid he is injured badly, loosing an eye, his right hand and two fingers on his left hand. He can no longer serve on the front line. In 1943 General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) fails in his attempt to assassin Hitler and the German Resistance loss an army officer to help with operations. Von Stauffenberg is recruited in the resistance and the General Staff. He comes up with the Valkyrie plan which was to make the assassination of Hitler look like an SS plot, and get the army to launch a coup to 'protect' the Nazi regime. Von Stauffenberg is the only man who could get close to Hitler because he was the Chief-of-Staff for the Reserve Army General. The film is split into three major parts, the planning, the assassination attempt and the attempted coup.\n\nSinger was able to bring in a very stylist approach of direction. I enjoy Singer's films and he was able to show his skills again. He is able to get an excellent cast, including Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Terrence Stamp and Tom Wilkingson to name a few. However, he shot the film in the style of a thriller, which was interesting, but being a historical film with most people knowing the outcome already takes away the suspense. But Singer did make an enjoyable film. The film has a strong script\n\nValkyrie is a strong, enjoyable film. It is not Singer's best but he can still pull it of.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Valkyrie: Featurette -- \"Through Bryan Singer's Eyes\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3544383513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Valkyrie: Featurette -- \"Through Bryan Singer's Eyes\"", "uploadDate": "2008-11-15T15:16:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000129/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Cruise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0000129?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0631490/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bill Nighy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0631490?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "General Friedrich Olbricht"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396924/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Carice van Houten"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0396924?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nina von Stauffenberg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000654/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Terence Stamp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0000654?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ludwig Beck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0573618/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kevin McNally"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0573618?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dr. Carl Goerdeler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1756674/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jamie Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm1756674?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lieutenant Werner von Haeften"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390903/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tom Hollander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0390903?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Colonel Heinz Brandt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186469/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kenneth Cranham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0186469?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000110/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kenneth Branagh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0000110?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Major-General Henning von Tresckow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0929489/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tom Wilkinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0929489?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "General Friedrich Fromm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0470981/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Thomas Kretschmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0470981?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Major Otto Ernst Remer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0412850/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eddie Izzard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0412850?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "General Erich Fellgiebel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0075321/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Christian Berkel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0075321?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0051394/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "David Bamber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0051394?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Adolf Hitler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0774516/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "David Schofield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0985699/characters/nm0774516?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Erwin von Witzleben"}]}]}

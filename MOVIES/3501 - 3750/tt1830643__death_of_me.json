He directed the second, third and fourth instalments in the 'Saw' franchise and played a big role in making it what it was. He's also had some other gems along the way like 2010's 'Mother's Day'. Unfortunately 'Death of Me' is not his strongest work. In fact it's the weakest thing I've seen him put forward. The concept actually had potential which is the disappointing thing, but the way they went about structuring this movie was just horrific.\n\nThe movies opens with a very strange and intriguing scene. It left me excited for what the movie had to offer. Then as each revelation slowly came to light the movie became less and less interesting, until around the halfway point where it completely lost me. I tried to remain invested but it was just too hard. If it were not for Maggie Q's performance in the lead role, which she actually gave everything she had to, this movie would've gotten a lot lower rating than a 4/10 from me.\n\nI sometimes see terrible movies that are set on tropical islands and wonder whether they get the stars they do to appear in the movie by the promise of working in paradise for a few months. It's the only way I can imagine them getting Q and Luke Hemsworth to sign on. This is not one I can recommend sadly.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2036186649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU2MmRjMTUtMWVlNS00NDQ1LWJlMWYtMTU0ZGYwYzY0NzA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU2MmRjMTUtMWVlNS00NDQ1LWJlMWYtMTU0ZGYwYzY0NzA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "Vacationing on an island off the coast of Thailand, Christine (Maggie Q) and Neil Oliver (Luke Hemsworth) awake hungover and with no memory of the previous night.

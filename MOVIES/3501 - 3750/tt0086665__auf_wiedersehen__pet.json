Lets be honest, how many programmes can we honestly say that about?\n\nThe first series was pure genius. Relatively unknown actors proving you don't need big names to make some of the most watchable, amusing and heartwarming television around. Since then of course many of the actors have gone on to be household names.\n\nThe second series was also great, probably as good as it could ever have hoped to be. The third and fourth series in my opinion aren't as good and I feel have suffered by moving to the BBC. They seem too clean cut and professional, something the lads were never intended to be. However, I still find them very watchable, but that is mainly down to the characters created in the early 1980's.\n\nI doubt there'll be any more episodes now that bomber (the wonderfully understated Pat Roach) is no longer with us. To me this is the end of a TV era."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001758/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Timothy Spall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086665/characters/nm0001758?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Barry Taylor"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 1983-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372388/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tim Healy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086665/characters/nm0372388?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dennis Patterson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 1983-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0265457/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Christopher Fairbank"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086665/characters/nm0265457?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Albert Moxey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 1983-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0392619/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gary Holton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086665/characters/nm0392619?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Wayne Norris"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 1983-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0619700/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jimmy Nail"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086665/characters/nm0619700?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Oz Osborne"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 1983-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0923610/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kevin Whately"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086665/characters/nm0923610?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Neville Hope"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 1983-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0730053/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Pat Roach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086665/characters/nm0730053?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bomber Busbridge"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 1983-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0864942/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Julia Tobin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086665/characters/nm0864942?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Brenda Hope"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 1983-2004"}]}]}

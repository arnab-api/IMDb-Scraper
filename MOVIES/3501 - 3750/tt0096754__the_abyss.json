It mixes hard science with abject fantasy to make moral and philosophical points about the human condition and our place in the universe without the usual clich\u00e9s. And it does so with good dialog, strong characterization, and intensely emotional acting. Harris and Mastrantonio are absolutely electric together and dominate the screen, but the entire cast deserves plenty of credit. The production itself is mesmerizing despite its vast scale and tastefully used special effects. The film is long, but worth every second of the experience, and the slightly lengthier, more detailed Special Edition version is even better than the original.\n\nOstensibly, this is a film about first contact with non-terrestrial intelligence. But the story allegorically deals with an amazing array of themes common to great dramas - violence, love, capitalism, war, courage and cowardice. The hardest, most obedient soldier in the film, played spectacularly by Michael Biehn, is a coward, and a man who is hopelessly in love with his estranged wife (Harris) turns that love into an act of suicidal heroism which might unintentionally save the world. And yet nothing is exactly as it seems to be, and there are really no spoilers in this review. There are so many subtle and sensitively developed themes in this film that it is hard to imagine a more epically human drama in the sci-fi genre. Even so, this is a film which entertains at every level, and will satisfy the action fan as much as the wannabe film critic. ;-) \n\nMost of the film takes place on an experimental submarine drilling platform owned by a petroleum company. A nuclear sub has been lost in \"the abyss\" - a subduction trench near the Caiman Islands - after encountering an impossibly fast object. Soon, the US military commandeers the platform and its command ship - The Benthic Explorer - to attempt a rescue mission. As everything begins to go wrong, and the encounters with strange phenomena continue, the Navy SEAL in charge of the rescue attempt begins to crack. Meanwhile, on the surface, accusations concerning the sub are escalating between the USSR and USA, and nuclear war seems immanent. This describes just a small segment of the deliciously complex plot that unfolds in The Abyss. You'll have to see it to enjoy the rest.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Abyss", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2643788057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThkYjlhNGItN2Q1MC00Yjk5LWIwNzEtYWZiYjkxZDU1ZTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThkYjlhNGItN2Q1MC00Yjk5LWIwNzEtYWZiYjkxZDU1ZTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:58:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000438/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ed Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096754/characters/nm0000438?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bud Brigman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000299/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Biehn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096754/characters/nm0000299?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lt.

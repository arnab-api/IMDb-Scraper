No sooner had the hilarity ended then we had a moment of high drama followed by more comedy with the dumb salesman and then the grand finale which took me completely by surprise . The plot twisted and turned and was brilliantly written and acted . I can't wait for the next Inside No 9.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2482223641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE2Y2Q0NjgtOWQwMC00NmZkLWJhZWEtMWNhNjc5NTI5ODIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXJoYW5uYWg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE2Y2Q0NjgtOWQwMC00NmZkLWJhZWEtMWNhNjc5NTI5ODIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXJoYW5uYWg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-11-05T19:09:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0790501/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Reece Shearsmith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2674806/characters/nm0790501?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aidan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2014-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0671487/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Steve Pemberton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2674806/characters/nm0671487?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Adrian"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2014-2021"}]}]}

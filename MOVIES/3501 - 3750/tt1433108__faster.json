Whether throwaway crap like \"The Scorpion King\" or just plain embarrassing stuff like \"The Tooth Fairy\" (we get it Dwayne, you can laugh at yourself - how about getting down to business!), I just never felt compelled to see one of his movies. Until now.\n\nI could tell from the trailer this one was going to be different.\n\nFaster is a throwback to the merciless action flicks of the 1970s. Existential in tone. Ruthless in execution. It's kind of a cross between Death Wish and Vanishing Point. A pure, undiluted revenge drama that shows Dwayne Johnson really can walk the walk when he wants to. This isn't G-rated pabulum for the whole family. This is a leather glove across the chops, R-rated blast from the muzzle of a sawed-off shotgun. The plot isn't very complex, but the pacing is beautiful, as is the purity of this amazing movie.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton does a great job too as The Cop, a lowlife drug addicted, slimy little lawman with 9 days to go before retirement and one last case to solve. And Oliver Jackson-Cohen is terrific as a yuppie hit-man with a personal score to settle.\n\nIf you like movies that are intent simply in kicking your ass for 90 minutes, you could do a lot worse than Faster. After all these years, I'm finally a Dwayne Johnson fan.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Faster: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4163606809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5NzI3NDk3MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDAzMjA3MzMx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5NzI3NDk3MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDAzMjA3MzMx._V1_.jpg", "description": "An ex-con sets out to avenge his brother's death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago.

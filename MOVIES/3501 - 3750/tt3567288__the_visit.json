The suspense was real and at times too much for me. No fault there. The problem I had came late. It seemed to me like they ran out of money at the last moment and just slapped on an ending to finish. They never explained what exactly happened to both sets of old people and how one set came to live in the house and who they really were. Then there was a female visitor the kids met earlier in the film who was seen arguing with them, then the kids made a comment about how they never saw her leave but this too was never explained.\n\nHad these loose ends been tied up satisfactorily I would have given the film a 9. The ending just felt tacked on with none of the mystery explained. Before that though, there was an entertainingly tense thriller that was surprisingly good,", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3728978201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MDI3NjUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4NDU0NTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MDI3NjUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4NDU0NTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A single mother finds that things in her family's life go very wrong after her two young children visit their grandparents.", "uploadDate": "2015-04-24T10:22:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4609822/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Olivia DeJonge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm4609822?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Becca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0241759/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Deanna Dunagan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm0241759?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1063517/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kathryn Hahn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm1063517?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2470365/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Samuel Stricklen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm2470365?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Conductor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179647/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jorge Cordova"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm0179647?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Miguel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1235280/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Benjamin Kanes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm1235280?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7411056/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Seamus Moroney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm7411056?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young Tyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4590837/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ed Oxenbould"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm4590837?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0574513/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Peter McRobbie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm0574513?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pop Pop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2623219/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Celia Keenan-Bolger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm2623219?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Stacey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1113773/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Patch Darragh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm1113773?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Sam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4281945/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Steve Annan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm4281945?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Man on the Street"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7337093/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ocean James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3567288/characters/nm7337093?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Young Becca"}]}]}

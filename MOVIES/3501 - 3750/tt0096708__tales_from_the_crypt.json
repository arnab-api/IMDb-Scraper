OK maybe in the first short season, it wasn't as apparent as the superb later seasons would be, but this did lay the groundwork (side note: none of the tales in the first 6 episodes of this series actually came from the \"Tales From the Crypt\" comic series technically). Not to say this season wasn't good, quite the opposite as the maniac Santa story of \"And all through the House\" and the black comedic \"Collection Completed\" are classic episodes, even if the other 4 are not really up to snuff. Even the second season would get so much better by leaps and bounds.\n\nMy Season one grade: B\n\nSeason 1 Extras: New introduction from a now heavily bandaged Cryptkeeper; the cool \"Tales from the Crypt: From Comic Books to Television\" documentary and the not nearly as cool 5 and a half minute \"Crypt Keeper's History Of Season 1\""}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Tales from the Crypt: The Complete Seasons 1&2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi948437273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI2YzM4MmQtOTlhOS00ZTUwLWE4ZjctMWIzMGNjZTk2MmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI2YzM4MmQtOTlhOS00ZTUwLWE4ZjctMWIzMGNjZTk2MmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:06:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0440885/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Kassir"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096708/characters/nm0440885?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Crypt Keeper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "93 episodes, 1989-1996"}]}]}

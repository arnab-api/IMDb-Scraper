Geeky Casey has the idea that the staff have been infected, taken over by aliens using their bodies as hosts.  Casey's theory spreads to a group of students who decide to take a stand.\n\nOh my God \u0096 an enjoyable and quite clever teen movie!  Something must be wrong!  The plot is basically a teen twist on The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but is filled with clever references and jokes related to sci-fi. This makes it stand out from other teen movies in that it cleverly plays with the usual stereotypes and makes them feel fresh.  The group itself is close to the usual group that learns to get along and accept each other (a la Breakfast Club) \u0096 except here they get along through drugs and the battle against aliens!\n\nThe director is better known for his big OTT action stuff but here he does a good job with a slow build up and a real feeling of paranoia.  Of course it's not as good as the actual Body Snatchers but it still has a real good feeling of fear and tension.  The effects are good but Rodriguez uses them sparingly for the most part helping the mood of uncertainty and fear.\n\nThe cast are all good.  The teens play the stereotypes well but they are outshone by the adults who all get to ham it up in sinister roles.  Many of the adults are wasted in minor roles \u0096 Hayek for one is barely in it, and MacDonald deserves more than a few minutes.  Patrick is very good considering that it could have easily been his T2 role again \u0096 running in that distinctive way etc, but he is suitably sinister.  Janssen is also good \u0096 transforming from a shy flower into her usual vamp.  Cameos from Usher, Summer Phoenix and a seemingly pointless role for Harry Knowles (he's been bought!) don't spoil this.\n\nOverall as a sci-fi horror it's pretty good if not great \u0096 there are better films around.  But as a teen movie it is head and shoulders above the rest of this rather sorry genre and has enough tension, drama and references to be very enjoyable."}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Faculty", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi54043673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThjZGFlMjEtMmY0NS00NjcwLWFkMWMtYTQ3ZmRjM2FlZWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThjZGFlMjEtMmY0NS00NjcwLWFkMWMtYTQ3ZmRjM2FlZWE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2012-09-26T03:38:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0108287/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jordana Brewster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0108287?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Delilah Profitt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364977/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0364977?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marybeth Louise Hutchinson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004999/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Shawn Hatosy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0004999?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stan Rosado"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000463/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Famke Janssen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0000463?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Miss Elizabeth Burke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001520/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Christopher McDonald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0001520?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Frank Connor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001598/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Robert Patrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0001598?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Coach Joe Willis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829537/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jon Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0829537?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Prof. Edward Furlong"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000704/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Elijah Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0000704?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Casey Connor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0245112/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Clea DuVall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0245112?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stokely 'Stokes' Mitchell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001326/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Josh Hartnett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0001326?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Zeke Tyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000161/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Salma Hayek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0000161?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nurse Rosa Harper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001453/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Piper Laurie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0001453?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mrs. Karen Olson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001564/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bebe Neuwirth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0001564?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Principal Valerie Drake"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0713378/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Usher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0713378?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gabe Santora"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0901926/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Daniel von Bargen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0133751/characters/nm0901926?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mr. John Tate"}]}]}

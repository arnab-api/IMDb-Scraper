THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES captured the reality of the post-war 1940's. TAXI DRIVER is a masterpiece of social distortion and paranoia exemplary of the 1970's. No film other than EASY RIDER captures the late 1960's as seen by the American counter-culture. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's story of two men who go in search of America and 'freedom' is a bona fide sign of the times. I may not have been around at the time, but it is great to see a film portraying the long-haired, hippie attitude towards an America in turmoil in the form of a biker flick, circa 1969.\n\nEASY RIDER is an exploration of vast and desolate parts of the country. Of course, the stop at Mardi Gras is a necessity, but what Fonda and director Hopper are trying to tell us is that there was no 'freedom' as they saw it. The sprawling journey shows filmgoers the multiple frictions and shattered idealism of a generation in the midst of cultural change. Sex, drugs, and music were exploding socially and 1960's ideology may have come to an end in 1969, literally and figuratively speaking - much like it shockingly does in this film.\n\nPeter Fonda plays cool \"Captain America\", otherwise known as Wyatt, while Hopper is a paranoid prophet of the hippies as \"Billy the Kid\". The stunning DVD version of the film notes the importance of Laszlo Kovacs, the director of photography. Much of the film consists of Kovacs' simple shooting of the riders as they travel spiraling highways and bigoted backroads. It is some beautiful footage and essential to the trip. A major deal is made, much grass is smoked, and the film takes off from there. Their ultimate goal is never clearly defined, but Fonda's final comment to Hopper may sum it up for viewers. Did they find what America was supposed to be about? I guess not according to Fonda.\n\nThere is a surreal experience at a commune the Kid and Wyatt stop at. These scenes are out of a Fellini film. One significant shot paints the commune with a 360 degree pan across the faces of the live-in hippies. The expressions on the faces all seem different, some grinning, others just zoned out. Kovac's amazing camera work (especially on the road with the bikes) along with a virtual who's who in rock music of the late 60's makes for a sometimes visceral filmgoing experience. The immortal 'Born to be Wild' blares over the opening title sequence and everyone from Hendrix to The Byrds are heard throughout. \n\nEASY RIDER also contains one of Jack Nicholson's 2 or 3 most memorable performances, even to this day. As drunken lawyer \"George Hanson\", he creates an amazingly funny and perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fonda. He realizes what the general public can think of the \"long-hairs\" and puts himself in danger just by traveling with them. A bizarre notion of alien presence in the U.S. government is part of a hilarious conversation Nicholson and Hopper have over Whiskey and smoke. His scenes on Fonda's chopper with the golden football helmet are absolute, cinematic classics. \n\nCredit must be given to Fonda, Hopper, Nicholson, Kovacs, and Terry Southern for giving a new face to movie-making. They captured the era in a raw, jump cutting fashion. Maybe the hippies were not entirely right by trying to live off the land, or smoking dope all the time, but they may have been onto something.\n\nRATING: ***1/2", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Easy Rider", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2980315417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFhYzcyNzEtOTA0NS00NzAwLTg2ZjktZDNhMmRlNTFlOTE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFhYzcyNzEtOTA0NS00NzAwLTg2ZjktZDNhMmRlNTFlOTE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:59:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001228/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Fonda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0001228?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Wyatt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0579234/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Antonio Mendoza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0579234?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jesus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0556349/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mac Mashourian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0556349?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bodyguard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0173180/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tita Colorado"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0173180?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rancher's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0026035/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Luana Anders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0026035?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lisa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0943671/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sandy Brown Wyeth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0943671?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Joanne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0050451/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Robert Ball"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0050451?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mime #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0907721/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ellie Wood Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0907721?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mime #3"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000454/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dennis Hopper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0000454?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Billy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0817489/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Phil Spector"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0817489?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Connection"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0278258/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Warren Finnerty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0278258?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rancher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0039435/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Luke Askew"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0039435?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Stranger on Highway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0770124/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sabrina Scharf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0770124?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0907480/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robert Walker Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0907480?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0680284/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Carmen Phillips"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064276/characters/nm0680284?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mime #2"}]}]}

She was ten times better than Locklear. Don't get me wrong. I like Heather just as much as the next heterosexual male, but I don't think that comedy is for her. Anyway, enough of that.\n\nMichael J. Fox made a great comeback with Spin City and Barry Bostwick really showcased his talent for comedy in this show. I first became familiar with Barry Bostwick in \"Weekend at Bernies II.\" His role in that film was hilarious--he was probably one of very few actors that was funny in that movie. Anyway, I knew him from that and I just knew he would kill on Spin City.\n\nAlan Ruck is \"DA BOMB\" - NUFF SAID Also, I saw Michael Boatman and didn't think he would be that funny. Since I am a die hard Quantum Leap fan, I recognized Boatman from an episode of Quantum Leap. However, the character he played was serious and tragic. Anyway, I'm glad I was wrong because he was pretty funny in it too.\n\nCharlie Sheen came along and was funny enough for me. Apparently he wasn't too funny for the ratings. Oh well.......everything must come to an end some time."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Spin City: All Six Seasons", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2844172569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg4YTUzZTgtYTFlMC00NzRjLTgwOGQtYzM2OTVhYmRiODQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg4YTUzZTgtYTFlMC00NzRjLTgwOGQtYzM2OTVhYmRiODQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Spin City: All Six Seasons", "uploadDate": "2012-01-17T06:31:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0454236/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Kind"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115369/characters/nm0454236?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Lassiter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "145 episodes, 1996-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0090225/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Boatman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115369/characters/nm0090225?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carter Heywood"}, {"url": "#", "name": "145 episodes, 1996-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000150/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael J.

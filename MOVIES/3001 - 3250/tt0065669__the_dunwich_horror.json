The film is based on the writings of the almighty H.P. Lovecraft, which may be one of the reasons why many fellow Horror lovers find it to be disappointing. Many films based on Lovecraft writings are downright brilliant all-time Horror-greats, above all Roger Corman's \"Haunted Palace\" (1963) with Vincent Price (which was marketed as a Poe-adaptation), Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead\" (1981) and Stuart Gordon's \"Re-Animator\" (1985), just to name three absolute masterpieces inspired by this great writer's work. \"The Dunwitch Horror\", of course, comes nowhere near the brilliance of films like those just mentioned, it is not even comparable to films like these, and it is certainly no classic, but while the film has its flaws, it is still an entertaining film that has its qualities.\n\nI will not go into detail regarding the plot, but, as usual for Lovecraft adapt ions, the Necronomicon, and the 'Old Ones' play an important role. The quality of the performances differs. Sandra Dee, is sexy and nice to look at in the female lead, and she even reveals some of her charms, but her performance is quite awful. Dean Stockwell (who sports one of the most fake-looking mustaches in motion picture history) arguably delivers the best performance in the film, and the cast furthermore includes Sam Jaffe and the weird-looking Ed Begley (\"12 Angry Men\", \"Hang 'Em High\") in one of his last roles. Talia Shire also has a small role. The visual style is very much a matter of personal taste. The film has a nice general atmosphere and cool settings. The occasional flashy colors, in which the whole screen turns at some points, don't really fit in and annoy at times. The films greatest aspect is the excellent score by Les Baxter, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. The film has a brilliant animated opening credit sequence, which is another reason to give it a try. All things considered, \"The Dunwich Horror\" is certainly no great film, but even though it is quite cheesy and never really suspenseful it is yet a highly entertaining little film that I recommend to fans of occult fun.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Dunwich Horror", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi10814745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZkMmYzY2EtMThiZS00N2Q0LThlYzMtYWNjNTkwOTM1YmIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZkMmYzY2EtMThiZS00N2Q0LThlYzMtYWNjNTkwOTM1YmIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from MGM", "uploadDate": "2009-10-31T06:02:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000364/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sandra Dee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0000364?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nancy Wagner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003225/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ed Begley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0003225?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Henry Armitage"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0415488/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sam Jaffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0415488?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Old Whateley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0045225/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Donna Baccala"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0045225?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Elizabeth Hamilton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0289147/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michael Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0289147?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dr. Raskin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0606371/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Barboura Morris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0606371?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Cole"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0354271/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michael Haynes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0354271?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Guard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0682372/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jack Pierce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0682372?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Reeger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001777/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dean Stockwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0001777?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wilbur Whateley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001957/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lloyd Bochner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0001957?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Cory"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0430020/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joanne Moore Jordan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0430020?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lavinia Whateley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001735/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Talia Shire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0001735?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nurse Cora"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935067/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jason Wingreen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0935067?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sheriff Harrison"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0225398/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Beach Dickerson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0225398?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mr. Cole"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0750914/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Toby Russ"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065669/characters/nm0750914?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Librarian"}]}]}

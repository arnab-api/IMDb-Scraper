I always loved watching it, it had the most incredible effects and I thought it was so funny. I was such a deranged 7 year old I guess. But still to this day, I really enjoy watching Death Becomes Her. It has a very clever story, amazing effects and three great actors: Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. Who said dark comedies can't be good? Death Becomes her shows the true competitive side of women that scares most of the human race, how far we will go to be the hottest, the smartest, the kindest, etc. But also the whole essence of eternal youth, beauty and living forever, and Death Becomes Her handles the subject very well.\n\nActress Madeline Ashton and writer Helen Sharp are longtime rivals. Helen's life falls apart when glamorous Madeline steals Helen's fianc\u00e9, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville, and marries him. Seven years later, Helen is now an obese, depressed woman, and is arrested and placed in a mental institution. Obsessed with getting revenge against Madeline, she struggles in the institution with healing. Madeline's career on Broadway ends, and 14 years later she is still struggling with her fading looks and bygone acting career. Ernest, now an alcoholic and miserable in his marriage, has been reduced to working as a high-end mortician. When Madeline and Helen meet again at Helen's book-signing party, Helen appears miraculously rejuvenated, thin, and youthful. Madeline is first dumbfounded then jealous. As part of Helen's plan, she plays both Madeline and Ernest, telling them each she has never blamed them for her ruined love life. Madeline resorts to the aid of the mysterious Lisle Von Rhoman, who claims she has discovered the secret of eternal youth. Madeline purchases the potion, drinks it, and is delighted to see her body visibly losing the signs of aging as she watches in a mirror, leaving her thin, firm, and young. Helen, meanwhile, seduces Ernest and reveals to him a detailed and foolproof plot to kill Madeline. Ernest kills Madeline, Madeline is still alive\u0085 Madeline kills Helen\u0085 Helen is still alive\u0085 death has become them.\n\nThe film is flawed no doubt, it should have developed the characters a bit more, we never really understood why Madeline and Helen were friends in the first place as it seems like they've always hated each other, they could have just explored the friendship a little further. As well as why we should care what is happening to these pretty horrible characters. But still this is one of those films that for some reason keeps me watching it every time it pops up on TV. I think it was a lot of fun and had some good laughs, especially the fight between Madeline and Helen, they discover that there's really no point to inflicting physical pain but keep going at it with each other. This is a recommendation to those who have a strange sense of humor, it's something only a few will get.\n\n7/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Blu-Ray Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3075390233", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQ2OTY0NmItNmM5ZS00YWExLTgxMjQtN2UzYzViNTRjNTE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWQ2OTY0NmItNmM5ZS00YWExLTgxMjQtN2UzYzViNTRjNTE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-09-20T18:33:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000658/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Meryl Streep"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0000658?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Madeline Ashton Menville"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000443/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Goldie Hawn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0000443?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Helen Sharp"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0644707/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ian Ogilvy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0644707?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chagall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0279297/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nancy Fish"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0279297?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001400/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michelle Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0001400?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Anna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0291290/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "William Frankfather"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0291290?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mr. Franklin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0820527/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Clement von Franckenstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0820527?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Opening Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0418012/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jim Jansen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0418012?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Second Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bruce Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0000246?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Ernest Menville"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000618/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Isabella Rossellini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0000618?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lisle Von Rhuman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0832531/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Adam Storke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0832531?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dakota"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0355271/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alaina Reed-Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0355271?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Psychologist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0870729/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mary Ellen Trainor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0870729?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Vivian Adams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0408834/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Ingle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0408834?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Eulogist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0120838/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Petrea Burchard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104070/characters/nm0120838?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Opening Woman"}]}]}

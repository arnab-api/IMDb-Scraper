If the movie failed back in 1937, there would be no Disney Company today, no Lion King, and no Disneyland.  Disney's Folly, as critics first called it, would probably have scared any other industry from attempting such an ambitious and innovative project.  Pixar may not have ever had the chance to put out their groundbreaking features, and even the Disney- and fairy tale-bashing Shrek may never have been made if Snow White didn't set the course for the world of the animated feature.\n\nThere must have been tremendous pressure on everyone involved in the making of Snow White, but they did not disappoint.  The end result includes a timeless story, classic songs, and beautiful imagery that will live on for future generations to enjoy.  In fact, this was only the second movie that captured my nieces' full attention spans (The Lion King being the first).\n\nIn my opinion, the story was great but not perfect.  It's not as exciting or filled with as much witty remarks as today's animated features, but as soon as the dwarfs are introduced, the movie takes on an endearing lighter side. For the record, my favorite dwarf is Doc, because I can relate to him being a strong leader with some very humanistic follies, such as always getting tongue-tied (I do that myself all too often).  All the songs stand out in their own way.  `Some Day My Prince Will Come' is a classic, fairy-tale ballad.  `Heigh-Ho,' `Dig, Dig, Dig,' and `Whistle While You Work' are great songs to pick up your spirits when you have to go to work, do chores, or do homework.  And my favorite, `The Silly Song,' is just a great, catchy, and funny song.  As for the imagery, it's just breathtaking, especially considering how early it was introduced.  The colors are rich and lively, and the multi-plane camera does add some great depth to the movie.\n\nAs you can tell, for an animation and Disney fan like myself, Snow White is a perfect milestone in the movie world.  Even compared to the animation and storytelling styles of today, Snow White still stands the test of time. Kudos to everyone involved in this picture as their work will live on forever.\n\nMy IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo!

The security forces rush the president to the escape pod but he stays to help his family. However with the terrorists making great demands and starting to kill hostages on the plane the President has to make contact with the ground but also take on the terrorists.\n\nIt's not an original idea \u0096 Die Hard on a plane.  But hang on we've done Die Hard on a plane at least a few times in Passenger 57 and Executive Decision so how can we do it again?  By putting it on air force one of course.  So the President becomes John McClane and Gary Oldman is the usual Brit playing Euro-trash terrorist.  The difference between this and Die Hard is that here the action is a lot more stilted and underplayed \u0096 which is a surprise for an action movie.  However it does manage to have a good tension so it's still good.\n\nIt adds interest by having the action in the ground along with the political fighting in the White House over control of the situation.  It isn't an earth shattering script but it is good enough to get you carried away easily.  The only downside is that you can nearly always see where the formula is going at any one time.\n\nThe cast is good and is deep.  Ford has the age to play a President but the action status to give him that fighting edge.  Oldman is no stranger to hamming up his bad guys and doing iffy accents and here turns in a so-so performance as a cartoon terrorist.  The support cast is good \u0096 even if they have little to do.  Glenn Close, Dean Stcokwell et al don't have much to do but talk loud but do it well.  Macy, Berkeley, Prochnow and other big names add weight but have few lines.\n\nOverall this is a big Hollywood blockbuster that no doubt helped America feel good about itself.  It sticks close to the formula but the action is slick and quite tense and makes for an enjoyable, if unoriginal, 2 hours."}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3680287513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFkNzYyZjAtMzcxYy00ZTk3LWFiNjktYjgyZDZjMGUwYTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-09-14T22:24:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000148/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harrison Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0000148?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "President James Marshall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000335/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Glenn Close"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0000335?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vice President Kathryn Bennett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0560093/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Liesel Matthews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0560093?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alice Marshall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0075359/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Xander Berkeley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0075359?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Agent Gibbs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001777/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dean Stockwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0001777?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Defense Secretary Walter Dean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001638/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "J\u00fcrgen Prochnow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0001638?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "General Alexander Radek"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0588999/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michael Ray Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0588999?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "AFO Pilot Colonel Axelrod"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0490078/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Elester Latham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0490078?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "AFO Navigator"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0490078?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Major Bridges"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000198/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gary Oldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0000198?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ivan Korshunov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0187724/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wendy Crewson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0187724?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Grace Marshall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002117/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paul Guilfoyle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118571/characters/nm0002117?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chief of Staff Lloyd Shepherd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000513/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "William H.

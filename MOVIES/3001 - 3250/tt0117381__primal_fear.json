You know what I mean: Someone gets wrongly accused of some mischief, he can't pay a lawyer, but of course there is one who is really interested in the case and he is prepared to defend the poor guy anyway. The defender finds some wholes in the police investigation or in the statement of the other party and knows to prove the innocence of his client and even get a big indemnity. Well, I was wrong, for once this was a courtroom drama that had a bit more to offer than the usual story line and twists. In fact, this was even a very enjoyable movie.\n\nEven though I'm not really a fan of Richard Gere (I'm not a woman, so no I don't like him because the way he looks, I only look at his acting), I have to admit that this time he really did a very good job as the slick, media-friendly, arrogant lawyer Martin Vail. Still, in my opinion the real star in this movie is Edward Norton. He's really excellent as the altar boy who is accused of murdering a Catholic bishop. \n\nFor once the story isn't as predictable as usual. At first the case seems rather clear: an altar boy is running away from the home of the bishop, with blood all over his clothes. No doubt about it you think, he did it, case closed, next movie! But than the first interesting twist in the movie appears: Yes, he was at the murder scene, but he can't remember anything about the grisly murder, because at that exact moment he got a blackout. He's convinced that there was a third person in the room. That third person must have killed the bishop, he's innocent. His lawyer tries to prove the third man theory in the court room, but as the process comes nearer to the end, some new evidence will make everything a lot clearer and more interesting...\n\nAs I already said, this movie is more than just worth a watch, thanks to the rather innovative story line and characters. For once, this movie didn't annoy me more than I could ever like it. That's already worth a lot, so I give it a well deserved 8/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H9M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Primal Fear", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1064350745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRlZDUyM2MtOTBmNS00NTFmLWE4OWItZGFhNTQwMTUxODQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRlZDUyM2MtOTBmNS00NTFmLWE4OWItZGFhNTQwMTUxODQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2016-06-03T21:51:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000152/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Gere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0000152?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Martin Vail"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001498/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Mahoney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0001498?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Shaughnessy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000531/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Frances McDormand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0000531?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Molly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642368/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Terry O'Quinn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0642368?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Yancy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000874/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Steven Bauer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0000874?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Pinero"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686470/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tony Plana"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0686470?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Martinez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005491/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Maura Tierney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0005491?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Naomi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0737138/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Reg Rogers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0737138?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Connerman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001473/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laura Linney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0001473?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Janet Venable"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005569/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alfre Woodard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0005569?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shoat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001570/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Edward Norton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0001570?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aaron"}, {"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0001570?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Roy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0105672/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Andre Braugher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0105672?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Goodman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0816876/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joe Spano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0816876?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stenner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0027454/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Stanley Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0027454?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rushman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0781218/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jon Seda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117381/characters/nm0781218?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alex"}]}]}

He is yet another talented comedian in a line of many others bred at the talent breeding grounds known as the Daily Show. For people who don't know, Oliver lured away the talented Tim Carvell, former head writer for the daily show, away from Jon Stewart. This was clearly a brilliant move and Stewart was nice enough to part with Carvell. Now that both Oliver and Carvell have a show on HBO with pretty much unlimited creative freedom, they are tackling the most important issues with a fearless tenacity that most comedians/hosts/shows can't afford to have. The reporting is concise and brilliantly edited, the delivery is sharp and witty, and the fact that the show is only 30 minutes long is long enough to hold most people's attention. Good job HBO on creating this gem!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Season 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3962944793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQxYTJkZWMtMjRlNC00ZDJkLThkZDgtNzU0YzFhMjMyZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQxYTJkZWMtMjRlNC00ZDJkLThkZDgtNzU0YzFhMjMyZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Season 3", "uploadDate": "2019-04-09T17:01:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1056659/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Oliver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3530232/characters/nm1056659?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "209 episodes, 2014-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0443286/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Kaye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3530232/characters/nm0443286?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Voice Over"}, {"url": "#", "name": "139 episodes, 2014-2021"}]}]}

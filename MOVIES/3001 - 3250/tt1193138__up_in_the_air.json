About a man whose unique job is to fly around the country to inform people that they are fired. He meets a young ambitious woman that joins his company and who wants to change the system. Her ideas clash with his personal lifestyle choices.\n\nWhat the movie really is about is lifestyle choices, and relationship choices, choosing independence and freedom versus commitment and well established interpersonal relationships. By taking a definitive stance the movie provides interesting commentary on those that for whatever reason (not necessarily for work) don't stay put. \n\nA Monotone mood is established, that gave a bland aspect as though nothing substantial was happening. Part of the story took a dull meandering at times, however there were unconventional plot twists that made something that was seemingly Hollywood predictable not that way at all. And it was still interesting and entertaining to watch the contemporary witticisms. \n\nThe two main characters, although not the most true to life characters ever created, were brilliant satires of people we all know. We are all too familiar with the fiercely independent, non-committal, cockily at ease bachelor and we have also come across the, sharp, type A, ivy league know it all yet with an obvious naivety especially shown with her declaration of the specific laundry list of traits that her partner must have. \n\nThere were also some smart satirical illustrations of contemporary times in business, relationships, how people interact and the recession. For example the use of the smart phones in the new techno/relationship world is not simply put in as a momentum mechanism but is used as a symbol to satirize contemporary society. \n\nIt is not so much Clooney's acting that is a marvel as the casting, which was perfect. By being so spot on by choosing someone on the cusp of getting a little older yet with plenty of playful, youthful vigor we sense the conflict and the melancholy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Up in the Air: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3344040473", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3ODI2NjM2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkzMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3ODI2NjM2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkzMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Ryan Bingham is a corporate downsizing expert whose cherished life on the road is threatened just as he is on the cusp of reaching ten million frequent flyer miles and just after he's met the frequent-traveler woman of his dreams.", "uploadDate": "2009-10-03T13:59:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000123/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Clooney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1193138/characters/nm0000123?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Bingham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447695/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anna Kendrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1193138/characters/nm0447695?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Natalie Keener"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0607920/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Amy Morton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1193138/characters/nm0607920?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kara Bingham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0799777/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "J.K.

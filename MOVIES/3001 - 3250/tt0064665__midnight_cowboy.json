On the arrival, he is lured by the crippled crook Enrico Salvatore \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) that takes some money from him. Soon Joe is broken and homeless without any client or money, and he meets Ratso again on the streets that invites him to move to his apartment in a derelict building. Ratso has a strange cough and his health gets worse. He dreams on moving to Florida where he believes he will be healthy again. Joe and Ratso develop a friendship and Joe decides to go with his friend to Florida as soon as he gets the necessary money. \n\n\"Midnight Cowboy\" is a depressing tale of friendship and shattered dreams of losers. In flashbacks, the viewer sees that Joe is raised by his grandmother that neglects him and is raped with his girlfriend, who was actually a slut, by a gang when he is a teenager. Further, his grandmother's boyfriends are cowboys and he has very limited education. Therefore he has a wrong concept of women and love, and believes that he will be a sensation with mature women in New York. Ratso is the son of an Italian immigrant that works as a shoe-shiner and has had problems with his lungs for a long time. These two needy characters team-up to survive on the streets of New York and become better persons through their friendship. John Schlesinger has made a stunning classic that has not aged with an unpleasant story using magnificent screenplay and outstanding cast led by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Perdidos na Noite\" (\"Lost in the Night\")", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000163/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dustin Hoffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064665/characters/nm0000163?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ratso"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0587249/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sylvia Miles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064665/characters/nm0587249?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cass"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0882853/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brenda Vaccaro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064665/characters/nm0882853?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Shirley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0925418/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ruth White"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064665/characters/nm0925418?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sally Buck - Texas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0710250/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gilman Rankin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064665/characters/nm0710250?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Woodsy Niles - Texas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0549248/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "T.

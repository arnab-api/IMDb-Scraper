Look this is a funny movie, it's not ground breaking and it is certainly low-brow but it's actually quite enjoyable. The critics are trying to make it into the worst movie of the new year, which is sad because, in my opinion, it's as funny as anything that came out last year, including wedding crashers (although wedding crashers, I'll admit is a better film). The story relies on comedy to get by, the plot bobs and weaves, sometimes awkwardly, in the name of telling a joke rather than flowing an interesting plot line, that said, I enjoy the filmmaker's willingness to disregard any attempt to make the story realistic or to make the transitions genuine. The flow of the story seems as if it is constructed in an alternate universe where random parties come together with ease, while it may sound as if I'm being sarcastic I'm certainly not, I believe that most movie transitions are simply labored and lame attempts to get from point A to point B, they just jump almost directly to what they want to do next in Grandma's Boy ala the first Wayne's World, which keeps the movie from sagging. All and all, I believe this is a great comedy, it's certainly not for those with high brow taste, remember, critics typically like comedies like Sideways and Broken Flowers, movies that, while entertaining, find it difficult to make a young person laugh. If you liked There's Something About Mary and previous Sandler films, with the exceptions of Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love, you will enjoy Grandma's Boy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Grandma's Boy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi799408409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDhjNmUyNzEtOWUzNS00ZjlkLWJiNjItMDlkZmY0ODYwMzI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDhjNmUyNzEtOWUzNS00ZjlkLWJiNjItMDlkZmY0ODYwMzI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:03:44Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004802/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Linda Cardellini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0004802?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Samantha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0200601/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter Dante"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0200601?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dante"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004309/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Shirley Knight"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0004309?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bea"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005265/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kevin Nealon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0005265?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mr. Cheezle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0841910/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nick Swardson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0841910?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jeff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0950515/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kelvin Yu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0950515?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1216633/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Scott Halberstadt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm1216633?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bobby, Co-Worker #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0382456/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Shana Hiatt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0382456?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Pamela Mills"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0184445/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Allen Covert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0184445?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429250/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shirley Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0429250?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Grace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0601376/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joel David Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0601376?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "J.P."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005368/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Doris Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm0005368?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Grandma Lilly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1706767/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jonah Hill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm1706767?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Barry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2071663/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Chuck Church"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm2071663?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1555476/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Heidi Hawking"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0456554/characters/nm1555476?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Milk Maid"}]}]}

Especially where there aren't any particular peak moments in the movie.\n\n\"About Cherry\" is about a young girl who leaves her dysfunctional family behind and moves to San Francisco with her friend. Here in the new town she starts making pornography for a living and earns good money, without heeding the dark side of her job. With her family ties and friendships on the line, Cherry balances a fine line which could easily tip her over.\n\nThe story is average, although it is quite painted out in stereotypical aspects, and it is to the point where it starts to become a daytime soap show; alcoholism, pornographic business, drug abuse, family problems, and so forth.\n\nThe problem with \"About Cherry\" is the characters in the story, as they are unfathomably one-dimensional and just doesn't really show much personality or give you enough of them to make you care. You just sit throughout the entire movie with a shrug and occasional shake of the head.\n\nBe warned that there is an excessive amount of nudity and sexual references in the movie, obviously as the movie does revolve around the pornographic industry. Personally, I didn't care much for it, because it was done to the point where it was too much, bordering on being softcore pornography at times.\n\nPersonally, I did find that most people in the movie did fair enough jobs with their given roles, but only a couple of them managed to stand out in the movie, and those were Dev Patel (playing Andrew), Heather Graham (playing Margaret) and Lili Taylor (playing Phyllis).\n\nI am sure if you are fans of anyone in the movie, then you might find some greater enjoyment in this movie, or if you have some kind of fascination with the way the pornographic business works, then this might be something for you. But if you are watching this for entertainment, as I did, then you will not walk away with a 'wow' sensation, because the movie just doesn't rock the boat.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3959268633", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NTI5NDM3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM1NjAyOA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NTI5NDM3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM1NjAyOA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A troubled young woman moves to San Francisco, where she gets involved in pornography and aligns herself with a cocaine-addicted lawyer.", "uploadDate": "2012-08-03T07:35:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3358233/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ashley Hinshaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1945062/characters/nm3358233?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Angelina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2353862/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dev Patel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1945062/characters/nm2353862?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Andrew"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4103976/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jonny Weston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1945062/characters/nm4103976?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bobby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001287/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Heather Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1945062/characters/nm0001287?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Margaret"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2591894/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Vincent Palo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1945062/characters/nm2591894?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5568258/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Isaac Fitzberald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1945062/characters/nm5568258?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mike G"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5568382/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "K.

Considering the hype revolving this movie I really thought it would differ more from the first and second one, but to me it only feels like one prolonged version of the first. Besides lacking in plot, the movie also has to much romance without anything leading up to it. It's like Edward and Bella are attached to each others lips to the extent of being unable to communicate with oneanother. It's not that I don't like romance quite the contrary, It's just hard for me to believe in them being In love, since they never seem to connect in any way. Also I really don't like the cop-father what's his face, he reminds me of Deputy Doofy from scary movie.\n\nIm not even going to mention all the incorrect facts \"Stephanie Meyer\" writes about vampires, but it is tedious work to try to ignore while watching the movie.\n\nSo in conclusion I urge everyone who's not a twelve-year old girl on acid, not to waste you precious time watching this movie. It doesn't matter how many awards it has received or records it has broken, people who enjoy this and consider it to be a movie of the vampire genre are (no offense) retarded.\n\nStill it get's a 4 because I'm in generous mood and despite the fact that \"Bella\" looks like a junky she's kind of cute in a cancer kind of way:)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Twilight Saga: Eclipse - \"Legend\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2562262553", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjExNDEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk3NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMjExNDEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk3NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Twilight Saga: Eclipse - \"Legend\" TV Spot", "uploadDate": "2010-06-22T09:24:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1882152/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Xavier Samuel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm1882152?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Riley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1500155/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Pattinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm1500155?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edward Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2014390/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Justin Chon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm2014390?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eric"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0919616/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Welch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm0919616?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1717152/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jackson Rathbone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm1717152?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jasper Hale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0418959/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paul Jarrett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm0418959?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mr. Biers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1020124/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sarah Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm1020124?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Renee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0714147/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Elizabeth Reaser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm0714147?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Esme Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829576/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kristen Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm0829576?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bella Swan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121605/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Billy Burke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm0121605?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Charlie Swan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447695/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anna Kendrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm0447695?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jessica"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1589312/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Christian Serratos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm1589312?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Angela"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2230865/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ashley Greene"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm2230865?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alice Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0703861/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Iris Quinn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm0703861?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mrs. Biers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004906/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter Facinelli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1325004/characters/nm0004906?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Dr. Carlisle Cullen"}]}]}

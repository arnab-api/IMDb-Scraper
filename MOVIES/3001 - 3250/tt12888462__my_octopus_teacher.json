We don't get to know the context except that human protagonist has gone through a period of crisis and goes back to one of his childhood occupations--underwater exploration. He doesn't set out to study the octopus, but is surprised by one in particular and in over a period of several days earns its trust. He learns something everyday right up to the end (and beyond). My title comes from the protagonist, Craig Foster who originally saw himself as visitor, but came to realize we all are part of nature. Beautiful and I mean beautiful cinematography and moodily appropriate music.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3668033817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEyOWQyYzItNDZhNS00OGJmLTk2MGItNDgzNmQyMjJkYzA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEyOWQyYzItNDZhNS00OGJmLTk2MGItNDgzNmQyMjJkYzA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-09-14T11:34:35Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0287741/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Craig Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12888462/characters/nm0287741?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Host & Founder of Sea Change Project"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6463020/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tom Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12888462/characters/nm6463020?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Self - Son of Craig Foster"}]}]}

I guess the story itself is not that new, but the way how it's done is simply excellent. The first, say, 30 minutes are just scraps- moments in the lives of the three main characters that mean absolutely nothing to the viewer (yet). Adding to that initial confusion is the fact that these scraps are not in temporal order so that in the beginning personally I wasn't sure I'd be able to follow- it was more like a music video that's just not making any sense at all. But then the pieces begin to come together just beautifully until in the end you can see the whole picture. Usually in these episode movies everything comes together at once somewhere in the middle of the film, but in \"21 Grams\" the viewer puts the pieces together one after another- like a jigsaw puzzle, and every bit as satisfying when everything's completed. This truly is a masterpiece script-wise, and I've never seen anything like it.\n\nThat brilliant script is supported by excellent actors. Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro are delivering the most convincing acting performance I've ever witnessed. Like when Christina (Watts) screams at Paul (Penn) trying to get rid of all of her anger, frustration, grief and hate: I usually think these emotional outbursts don't seem real on screen, but in this movie it is just deeply touching. I haven't seen \"Mystic River\" yet, but if Sean Penn was as good as he is in \"21 Grams\" then the Oscar finally really went to someone who truly deserved it. And Benicio del Toro really is every inch the wonderful actor his reputation claims (I saw him for the first time but had heard a lot of him before, so I was very curious).\n\nFinally, thank you, Mr. In\u00e1rritu for putting everything together this nicely. You've made a very impressing 100 % quality movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "21 Grams", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3383951641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRkMjI3N2YtZTdjZi00YzM3LTg4MDAtOGFhOTA5ZDE1NWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRkMjI3N2YtZTdjZi00YzM3LTg4MDAtOGFhOTA5ZDE1NWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T02:56:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000576/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sean Penn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm0000576?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Rivers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396812/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Danny Huston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm0396812?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1491205/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Claire Pakis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm1491205?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Laura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1737477/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nick Nichols"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm1737477?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0748270/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Rubinstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm0748270?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gynecologist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1491173/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Loyd Keith Salter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm1491173?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Fat Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0502425/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Melissa Leo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm0502425?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Marianne Jordan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1291871/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Teresa Delgado"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm1291871?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915208/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Naomi Watts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm0915208?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cristina Peck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1491202/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carly Nahon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm1491202?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cathy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001125/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Benicio Del Toro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm0001125?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jack Jordan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001250/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Charlotte Gainsbourg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm0001250?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mary Rivers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0550371/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Eddie Marsan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0315733/characters/nm0550371?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Reverend John"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1491150/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Antef A.

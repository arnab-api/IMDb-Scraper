While clich\u00e9's and political agenda runs rife, this is set nicely into an historic, epic story in three distinct acts.\n\nGreat casting - Hugh Jackman was what the role needed, and he played the role very well. Nicole Kidman, while being rubbished by several critics, appeared somewhat typecast in her role, but that style was exactly what the role needed, and I think she did a great job at pulling it off. However, I think that the standout performances actually came from Brandon Walters (in his first film), Jack Thompson (in a minor role) and David Wenham who brought 'aussie sleaze' to a new level. Unfortunately, I had trouble believing in Ben Mendelsohn's character of Captain Dutton, but seemed to finish on a high, pulling the 'British stiff upper lip' thing fairly well.\n\nLuhrman's epic was long, and had the full gamut of Luhrmanesque style, which we've come to love through his films. Stylised backgrounds, unique, visual approaches, and a sense of humour that is truly Luhrman, flood the film bringing a rich Australian environment.\n\n'Australia' presents to the world, perhaps a very different Australia to what a lot of people think. While the fictional characters and some of the style is very reminiscent of \"Gone with the Wind\", the historical Darwin during the 'Stolen Generation' era and the impact of World War Two on Australia's doorstep may be a new insite to many.\n\nI enjoyed 'Australia' a lot. While it wasn't the best film I've ever seen, I definitely think it's worth looking at - even if it's just to see what Baz Luhrman has done.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Australia: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1784152089", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot", "uploadDate": "2008-11-06T10:56:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011354/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Shea Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0011354?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carney Boy #3"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0057254/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ray Barrett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0057254?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ramsden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3188451/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jamal Sydney Bednarz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm3188451?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mission Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000986/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bryan Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0000986?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "King Carney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3188428/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tara Carpenter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm3188428?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Essential Services Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0188594/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lillian Crombie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0188594?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bandy Legs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0204583/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Essie Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0204583?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cath Carney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3188444/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michelle Dyzla"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm3188444?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hairdresser"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1812267/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eddie Baroo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm1812267?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bull"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0058181/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tony Barry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0058181?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sergeant Callahan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103009/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Damian Bradford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0103009?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Constable #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2530433/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nathin Butler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm2530433?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Carney Boy #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3188429/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rebecca Chatfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm3188429?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Magarri's Niece"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0191504/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Max Cullen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0191504?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Old Drunk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226583/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Arthur Dignam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0455824/characters/nm0226583?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Father Benedict"}]}]}

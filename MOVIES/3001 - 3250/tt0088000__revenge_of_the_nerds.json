What kinds of films influenced American Pie and Road Trip? It is easy to point out films like Porky's, Animal House and Fasttimes, but somewhere forgotten in all this is Jeff Kanew's hilarious flick REVENGE OF THE NERDS. This is not only entertaining and funny, but it contains what has to be considered a blue print for success in campus comedy. Take lots of people getting drunk, jocks ostracizing nerds from there way of life, the weak rising up to take back what is just as much a right as it is to others, and of course lots of nudity featuring an abundance of gorgeous women. What you have here is a great recipe for success.\n\nWhat made Revenge work is that it didn't try to pretend to be something that it wasn't. This was an exploitive sex-fest and it worked well. What it also had was a funny script and one that we could all relate to. I mean, who hasn't felt left out or relegated to the side lines while someone else gets all the glory? Besides being extremely funny, this film touched on something that we all can relate to.\n\nRevenge of the Nerds is another of the teen films that was hilarious and it ended up spawning a slew of sequels. Avoid them and see this one again. It's worth it, especially if you were a teen when it came out. And if you are a teen now, this is a treat to watch. This is one of the films that writers study when they are thinking what they can put into their film to make it crude, rude and raunchy. This should be a must see!\n\n9 out of 10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2332409369", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNiY2RlODYtZDdiMy00NGZmLTk4ZGUtMDE2M2IyOWE2M2FjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNiY2RlODYtZDdiMy00NGZmLTk4ZGUtMDE2M2IyOWE2M2FjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-08T21:50:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001019/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Carradine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0001019?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lewis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124079/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Timothy Busfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0124079?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Poindexter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035664/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Curtis Armstrong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0035664?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "'Booger'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0865058/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brian Tochi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0865058?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Takashi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001534/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michelle Meyrink"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0001534?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Judy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0758413/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Matt Salinger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0758413?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Burke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000342/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "James Cromwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0000342?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mr. Skolnick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000422/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Goodman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0000422?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Coach Harris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000381/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Anthony Edwards"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0000381?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gilbert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0144119/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Andrew Cassese"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088000/characters/nm0144119?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wormser"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0779467/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Larry B.

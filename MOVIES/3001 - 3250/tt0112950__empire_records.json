I don't own a lot of movies but this is one that I do. Like any film, it has it's problems but in general it is great. The film was well casted, each actor fit and made the best of his or her role. Maxwell Caulfield played Rex Manning, the character you love to hate. Anthony LaPaglia played Joe who was one of the best managers that you could work for. The actor's attitude toward his role was very well displayed. Rory Cochrane played Lucas, who is my favorite character in this movie. Then there is Johnny Whitworth, now everybody sort of disinclueds him or doesn't like him but I think that he did a good job as AJ, I could not see anyone else there, maybe someone could have done a better job but he did well. The rest of the cast was fantastic. The plot of the film was a little non existent, it's more like a series of events that just go one after the other with no really flow. Anyways, take the movie for what it is: teenagers working at a record store, dealing with life issues with good music playing in the background. This is a great film.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Empire Records", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi10813721", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M4OTIxYjEtNjdiMi00MTQzLTk0ZmYtYjk2ZjdjNTRkNzYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M4OTIxYjEtNjdiMi00MTQzLTk0ZmYtYjk2ZjdjNTRkNzYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

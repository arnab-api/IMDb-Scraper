Not content with being the undisputed king of music videos, he's set his sights on full-length-feature-films. One might imagine that the often surreal, always innovative humour of his short music promos might not transfer across to a much longer production \u0096 like hell. \u0091Being John Malkovich' is a fresh exciting stroke of genius.\n\nJohn Cusack is Craig Schwartz, an unemployed puppeteer looser guy. In order to earn a living he is forced to find himself a regular job, only it soon becomes apparent that regular it is not. Working as a filing clerk on floor seven and a half, Craig stumbles across a portal into John Malkovich's head. No, really, that's what happens. Anyway, he turns this into a business venture with help from the beautiful Maxine (Catherine Keener), whom he lusts after. Maxine is more interested, however, in his wife, Lotte (Diaz, like you've never seen her before) but only when she's being John Malkovich.\n\n Don't worry if this all sounds a little strange to you, it should do, it's probably the most surreal film ever made. I obviously can't give all the credit for this to director Spike Jonze; Charlie Kaufman is the genius that wrote this insanity. He's the most acutely imaginative and ingenious man of our time.\n\nWith such a fantastic cast the acting is of course superb; everyone's brilliant, especially Malkovich himself. Well obviously, you say, he's playing himself \u0096 yes, but he's also playing himself being played by an increasingly psychotic puppeteer.\n\nMonkey flash backs and a restaurant full of Malkoviches are highlights of the insanely brilliant and brilliantly insane movie. If you thought that Spike Jonez could never top the Daft Punk talking dog video, you have never been so wrong in your life.\n\n10/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Being John Malkovich", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3568894233", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA0ZjIyNmEtZTE4Mi00NDRiLWI3YjQtMDVlNDgyNWIxN2UxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA0ZjIyNmEtZTE4Mi00NDRiLWI3YjQtMDVlNDgyNWIxN2UxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:29:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000131/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Cusack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0000131?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Craig Schwartz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068709/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ned Bellamy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0068709?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Derek Mantini"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0484099/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Madison Lanc"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0484099?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Daughter at Puppet Show"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005316/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Kay Place"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0005316?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Floris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001416/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Catherine Keener"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0001416?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Maxine Lund"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686097/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Byrne Piven"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0686097?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Captain Mertin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000518/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Malkovich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0000518?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Horatio Malkovich"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308606/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Willie Garson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0308606?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Guy in Restaurant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000139/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cameron Diaz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0000139?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lotte Schwartz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0918435/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Eric Weinstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0918435?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Father at Puppet Show"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818055/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Octavia Spencer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0818055?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Woman in Elevator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004730/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Orson Bean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120601/characters/nm0004730?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Lester"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230151/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "K.K.

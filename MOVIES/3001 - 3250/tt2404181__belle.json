I did not know that it is based on a true story . I loved the settings, the costumes, the writing and the acting. A well written story of the start of the road to abolishing slavery in England. The Story of DIdo - the caring aunt and uncle who took her under their roof, the other niece who they are raising also and how she develops into a beautiful and very smart lady. I'm sure the reactions by the people at that time were presented accurately. Dido was not allowed to eat with company but could with just the family. The courting of the women when they were of that age was interesting to watch and the conniving by the mother of the two -oh so different men in the name of wanting more money to come from the women. I especially like the intelligence of Dido and how it came out in the age of when women were not to be involved in politics or anything other than the home.

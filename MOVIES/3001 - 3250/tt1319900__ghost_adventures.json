Several of late have been more interesting, and \"Ghost Adventures\" is one of them.\n\nThe formula for each show is similar - a team of paranormal investigators spends time in a purportedly haunted location in the hopes of capturing evidence of activity, whether audio, video, personal, or other experiences. Much infrared and night vision camera work ensues, with many dramatic moments and even a few expletives. Afterwards their footage is reviewed and replayed to note any unusual anomalies, like EVPs, \"orbs,\" noises, or occasional visual phenomena including apparitions.\n\nSince I have a great interest in history, the highlight of the show for me is the fact that the crew visits a wide variety of locales throughout the United States that have long and storied pasts. Most of them are unknown to me, boosting my interest substantially. The host does a fine job of providing background for the locale and the purposes of the many rooms or buildings within, not to mention possible reasons for the hauntings. Some of the locales are buildings which have been long abandoned, and are private property not opened to the public. Much of the furniture, layout, and years of dust are preserved for all to see.\n\nThe supernatural phenomena captured by the crew is fascinating, and often disturbing. The show relies on the trust and belief of the viewer to convey the fear and drama, and unfortunately much of what we see could be explained or reproduced with special effects technology. But even if the supernatural phenomena could be explained away, there is a certain ambiance to large, spooky, and historic buildings that is in itself fear inspiring.\n\nThere are a few flaws that sometimes detract from the experience. The investigators themselves do not carry themselves as professionals, and are apparently amateurs. Although they are brave to spend the night in such places, the show oftentimes reminds me of a juvenile dare, as opposed to a serious investigation. The host can often be downright obnoxious, and his antics sometimes cut into the atmosphere of the surroundings. The focus for the crew is to create tension, and they clearly inject drama in an attempt to make the show more interesting to the audience. This is all right, but for me further reduces their credibility as investigators.\n\nIn the end, though, the show's strong points make up for its flaws in my opinion. I will always try to catch it whenever possible, and find it to be generally fascinating and terrifying.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Ghost Adventures", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2694954265", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMxZTU2ODYtYmEzNS00Y2I2LWFlMDEtM2EyMzM3NWU1YjkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMxZTU2ODYtYmEzNS00Y2I2LWFlMDEtM2EyMzM3NWU1YjkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Ghost Adventures", "uploadDate": "2019-03-16T07:13:01Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3189839/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Zak Bagans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1319900/characters/nm3189839?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self"}, {"url": "#", "name": "274 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4283053/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Billy Tolley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1319900/characters/nm4283053?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Self"}, {"url": "#", "name": "198 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1530005/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nick Groff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1319900/characters/nm1530005?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Self"}, {"url": "#", "name": "139 episodes, 2008-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1108101/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aaron Goodwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1319900/characters/nm1108101?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Self"}, {"url": "#", "name": "273 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2769456/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jay Wasley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1319900/characters/nm2769456?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Self"}, {"url": "#", "name": "178 episodes, 2011-2021"}]}]}

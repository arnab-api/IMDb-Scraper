This is a historical drama where Mark Rylance plays the magistrate for this fortress on the frontier of the \"Empire\". There is no date or location given, and not even a name for the so-called \"empire\". This is because the main theme deals heavily with imperialism, and the mistreatment that has gone on in almost every example of it. Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson are the \"bad\" guys checking up on the frontier, and trying to handle the barbarians. Now that we have simple routine out of the way, let me describe how I personally thought this movie was. This film has very important themes, and strong performances, but struggles to really keep your attention. The movie starts off pretty strong, with this rivalry between Johnny Depp (who is brilliant in this by the way), and Mark Rylance. It was highly entertaining to see their ideology duel and it looked like it was going somewhere. However, then we get to the long second act where it basically takes too long at everything. Also, there is no Johnny Depp, or any interesting characters or plot really. Mark Rylance is good, but his character is just wimpy, and not charismatic. He is just utterly weak in almost every sense. He is also kinda creepy with his weird foot fetish scenes (you will know when you see them). It finally picks up in the third half which is carried by Robert Pattinson and Johnny Depp. This isn't because Mark Rylance is bad, but his character on his own is just extremely boring. Everytime Robert or Johnny was on screen, it was very entertaining. I just feel they made Mark's character way more interesting. Besides seldom clunky moments, the acting is pretty good. The actual story is kinda interesting, but I feel we have seen it done in a more entertaining fashion. Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying I wanted more action in this movie, I just felt like more conflict was needed especially in the second act. The themes are very important, and it does a good job of showing it (imperialism is bad). The cinematography was okay, it just didn't have a lot of \"wow\" moments. The soundtrack also didn't strike me much, but was okay. Honestly, if this film didn't have Johnny or Robert, I don't think I would have liked it nearly as much. In the end it is an okay film, but ultimately suffers from being kinda boring the whole second act. I will say that the Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson performances are worth it in the end. I would recommend renting this movie despite its shortcomings.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2417147417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Magistrate of an isolated frontier settlement on the border of an unnamed empire looks forward to an easy retirement until the arrival of Colonel Joll, whose task it is to report on the activities of the \"barbarians\" and on the security situation on the border.", "uploadDate": "2020-06-24T15:33:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0753314/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mark Rylance"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm0753314?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Magistrate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1500155/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Pattinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm1500155?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Officer Mandel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000627/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Greta Scacchi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm0000627?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2730580/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sam Reid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm2730580?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lieutenant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2389463/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bill Milner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm2389463?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Garrison Soldier 5"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7466690/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tserendagva Purevdorj"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm7466690?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Old Barbarian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6914709/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Moorst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm6914709?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Garrison Soldier 6"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0403996/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nayef Rashed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm0403996?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Farmer 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Colonel Joll"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7232418/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gana Bayarsaikhan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm7232418?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "The Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1399770/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Dencik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm1399770?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Clerk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0577982/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Harry Melling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm0577982?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Garrison Soldier 4"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5189020/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gursed Dalkhsuren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm5189020?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Old Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8964195/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Isabella Nefar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm8964195?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Star"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519034/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Joseph Long"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6149154/characters/nm0519034?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Baker"}]}]}

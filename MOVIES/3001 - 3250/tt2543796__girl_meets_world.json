Huge fan of Boy Meets World, so I was super excited for this. But I also tried to keep my expectations in check - it's its own show, the 1st season of BMW was fairly cheesy, etc. Well, I really liked it. \n\nOf course I'd like more Cory and Topanga, but the show is about Riley and her journey. And the two of them are incorporated, and I imagine will continue to be. (Think of how much we got to see of Amy and Alan's perspectives and they didn't even have the cult following.) I love the relationship between Riley and Maya - very Cory and Shawn. I think the actress playing Riley has the right amount of preteen curiosity and awkwardness as well as the ability to deliver humor. She seems like she'll be able to \"grow with the show\" as Cory did. \n\nMy only complaint is that some themes seem a bit forced - the \"finding the world and making it yours\" repeated over and over, and the \"Riley is going to save Maya\" motif is a little obvious. However, it's a kids show, so adult viewers need to remember that kids don't pick up on repetitive elements as easily. \n\nFor those worried about it being too \"Disney\", all I have to say is that after watching part of the \"Disney Channel Original Movie\" that was on before the pilot, this show is MUCH better than typical Disney shows. I think it has a lot of potential.\n\nI think true fans of BMW - the ones who love it for the wholesome and important messages it sent - should give this show a chance. As much as the majority of its viewership is probably made up of the adults 20+ who grew up with the original, the show is for a new generation. And I, for one, am happy that Michael Jacobs and April Kelly are bringing this kind of programming to today's kids. I think fans of the old will appreciate the tributes and similarities, and new fans will enjoy a new, quality show for a generation that needs it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Girl Meets World Teaser", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi395029785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMDk2ODI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA1NzAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMDk2ODI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA1NzAyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the first teaser for \"Girl Meets World\".", "uploadDate": "2014-04-11T11:59:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3688576/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rowan Blanchard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm3688576?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Riley Matthews"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4248775/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sabrina Carpenter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm4248775?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Maya Hart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5153308/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "August Maturo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm5153308?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Auggie Matthews"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4396310/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Corey Fogelmanis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm4396310?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Farkle Minkus"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7336473/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nicholas Jabonero"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm7336473?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Yogi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6037532/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jade Holden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm6037532?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Classmate"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1 episode, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4358124/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Darby Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm4358124?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Darby"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2014-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6795526/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Yindra Zayas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm6795526?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Yindra"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2015-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005399/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ben Savage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm0005399?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cory Matthews"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4873265/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Peyton Meyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm4873265?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lucas Friar"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004918/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Danielle Fishel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm0004918?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Topanga Matthews"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6589302/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sarah Carpenter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm6589302?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sarah"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6752069/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Nigel Suarez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm6752069?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Nigel"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1 episode, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7908958/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Clarissa Peralta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm7908958?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Clarissa"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1 episode, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7403904/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hunter Wickham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm7403904?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Dave"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4330082/?ref_=tt_cl_t16", "name": "Amir Mitchell-Townes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2543796/characters/nm4330082?ref_=tt_cl_t16", "name": "Isaiah 'Zay' Babineaux"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2015-2017"}]}]}

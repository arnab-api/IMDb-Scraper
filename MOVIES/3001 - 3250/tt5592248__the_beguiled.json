Two primary characters from the book don't make it into the movie, but a nothing character, who adds nothing to the plot, is added. The secrets of one character are hinted at and never revisited. Of course readers of the book know why--the character was seriously miscast. The women and girls never open their hearts to the injured soldier they take in, so we as viewers have no idea as to their motivations. They try to relay all through meaningful looks, but fall short. Personalities that should evolve and shine are stunted and dull. This is a character-based story that has been so diluted it's shares only the title with the original work.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3770661145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE2Mjc3ODI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY5ODYwMjI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE2Mjc3ODI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY5ODYwMjI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "At a girls' school in Virginia during the Civil War, where the young women have been sheltered from the outside world, a wounded Union soldier is taken in.

I probably can relate to this film a lot more than some people. Releasing a game on most formats in 1990, I had the storyline up to my eyeballs and the expectation of seeing the film was huge. When I was sixteen I managed to get someone to rent the video out for me (it received an `18' certificate). After watching once, I was slightly disappointed. Then, I watched it again.\n\nThis film has a deep, deep meaning. Clive Barker is an absolute genius. The storyline and plot are truly wonderful, on pace all the time, never letting up for a minute. There are plenty of standout scenes and memorable one-liners. Monsters are usually portrayed as evil, the bad. Here they want to live in secret, the humans are the ones that envy their purity and decide to invade the Night Breed's home underneath a cemetery. This myth has gone around for years, the Night Breed, the undead where the pain of real life goes away. And tied in the plot is Doctor Decker (aka The Mask), a serial killer who convinces his patient (Boone) that he has committed a series of brutal murders, and he must hand himself into the police.\n\n Arguably some of the scenes are a little silly, there is a hint of black-comedy in there which seems unnecessary in some scenes. However, the cemetery itself is the most beautiful looking things you will ever see in film, it's exotic, stylish, full of strange statues and buildings.\n\n Best scene in the film goes to Peloquin with desires to eat Boone. This is one that stays in my heart as one of the most powerful scenes in horror movie history, with some stunning acting and some great make-up. You can't help laughing when this monster spouts: `F*** the law, I want MEAT!' Other memorable scenes include the psychiatric patient who ends up ripping his own face off to prove he is worthy of the Breed. The wonder of this scene is Barker's hint of tongue-in-cheek. \n\nAs for the gore factor, it is pretty high, but I still believe Hellraiser and it's sequels are twice as gory as this. Definitely a film for Barker films to see. But not one to watch for a casual night in with a pizza and a few beers."}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Nightbreed", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2274951449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZiZmUxNzgtMTYwMS00M2RmLWJhMGItOGI1NDhhNzhiYzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2ZiZmUxNzgtMTYwMS00M2RmLWJhMGItOGI1NDhhNzhiYzE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Extra (Clip) from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:14:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001729/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Craig Sheffer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0100260/characters/nm0001729?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aaron Boone"}, {"url": "/title/tt0100260/characters/nm0001729?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cabal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000343/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "David Cronenberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0100260/characters/nm0000343?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Philip K.

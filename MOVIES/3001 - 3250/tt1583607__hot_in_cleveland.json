I've lived in the L.A. area off and on for over 20 years, and all the L.A. references are painfully HONEST.\n\nWendie Malick, Jane Leeves, Valerie Bertinelli and Betty White are hysterical! \n\nThe story lines are very realistic ...L.A. is really a very SADLY over-rated place to live, for many reasons. The sunshine is nice, but even that gets boring after a while. Between the high price of living, the traffic and the shallow people, it's really an awful place to live for any \"average\" person. Ironically, this show comes at a time in my life when I have decided to relocate to my home town of Chicago. \n\nI routinely experience just about all of the ones depicted on this show whenever I go back to Chicago. While it is true that there are shallow people everywhere in the world, L.A. seems to be the U.S. capital of \"the beautiful people.\" Living here is very exclusionary; everything is about money, status, power and looks. If you have those things, you'll be included; if not, you are SOL, no matter how good or nice a person you are.\n\nIt is true that in Chicago - and other Midwestern cities, most of the real men are not salaciously panting after women 1/2 their age. It is true that in other places, mature women are appreciated more than merely discarded after the age of 30. \n\nMy only regret about this show is that it is not on a major network ... it would get more exposure that way! So glad that it got picked up for more episodes.\n\nIf you're a fan, let's all get the word out and keep this show on the air!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hot In Cleveland", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1467071769", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJjOGVjMjctMzU3Zi00ODY2LTliY2MtMjFlZDc2ZGRlNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJjOGVjMjctMzU3Zi00ODY2LTliY2MtMjFlZDc2ZGRlNzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Hot In Cleveland", "uploadDate": "2019-04-12T23:04:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000933/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Valerie Bertinelli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1583607/characters/nm0000933?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Melanie Moretti"}, {"url": "#", "name": "129 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005176/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Wendie Malick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1583607/characters/nm0005176?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Victoria Chase"}, {"url": "#", "name": "129 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005137/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jane Leeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1583607/characters/nm0005137?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joy Scroggs"}, {"url": "#", "name": "129 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0924508/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Betty White"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1583607/characters/nm0924508?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elka Ostrovsky"}, {"url": "#", "name": "129 episodes, 2010-2015"}]}]}

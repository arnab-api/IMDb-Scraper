With her son and cat in tow, they take off to stay at a friend's apartment in Paris to figure things out.\n\nThe cat plays a prominent role and takes the film into the absurd realm. I could have done without this subplot as it changes the tone of the film halfway through. If they were going for surreal and absurd go in 100% or don't go there at all. The story didn't need it.\n\nDespite that, Pfeiffer's commitment to playing this affected, sarcastic woman keeps you interested. At times she is hilarious, then gradually the layers are pulled back, revealing the pain underneath the facade. Her scenes in the latter part of the film are emotional and moving.\n\nThe supporting cast was very good as well. Lucas Hedges, the seemingly go-to young actor in Hollywood, was appropriately deadpan and amusing. But it's Pfeiffer who deserves an Oscar nomination. It's truly one of her best roles.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3777347865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZDc4OWItYTNiMC00ODE4LTk1NmQtZTg4MDkwZDgyYzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZDc4OWItYTNiMC00ODE4LTk1NmQtZTg4MDkwZDgyYzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "\"My plan was to die before the money ran out,\" says 60-year-old penniless Manhattan socialite Frances Price (Michelle Pfeiffer), but things didn't go as planned.

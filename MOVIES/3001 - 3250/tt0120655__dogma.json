It's more the second-long \"ha!\" kind of comedy.\n\nThat simply means Kevin Smith's writing is clever enough to the point where you will be pleasantly shocked by some of the conversations and events of the film and think it all rather amusing and humorous. It's not hilarious, it's just clever and a bit funny.\n\nThe premise is rather interesting and surprisingly from a more fantasy-esquire genre than Smith traditionally dabbles with. Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are more or less fallen angels that have found a way back into heaven. They must be stopped or the world will come to a screeching halt, so a seemingly random protagonist named Bethany gets charged by God to stop them. Simple, but the slick, nonchalant approach to religion keeps the satire rampant.\n\nThe film does spend a lot of its time explaining itself, which isn't too bad considering Smith keeps the explanations to-the-point and allows the characters to stay interesting in the process. Chris Rock, who plays an apostle, and Alan Rickman, who plays God's messenger/ voice are two of these characters that are both good in the film and Smith has allowed to maintain their character's edge despite lines upon lines of explanation.\n\nGetting from point A to point B and so on is not the film's strength. The physical events that take place are ultimately boring and unexciting. It's the moments along the way, the conversations and the philosophy that come about, that make it successful. Affleck's character raises a lot of interesting religious questions about humanity and his conversation with the protagonist on the train is rather insightful. In general, Smith has used Bethany as a way to keep the viewers skepticism of the plot active in the film. She keeps it from getting preposterous. In general, the whole cast is very talented and their characters well written, which keeps the film interesting.\n\nIt's not the funniest or most interesting comedy in terms of plot and the sequence of events, but \"Dogma\" is a smart concept that ultimately results in a sharp satire and some great thoughts that scrutinize religion in a way that never seems too out of line.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H10M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1057144345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY2N2UyZTktMGVjNC00N2NlLWEzN2EtNzJiNTgyYjAwMzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY2N2UyZTktMGVjNC00N2NlLWEzN2EtNzJiNTgyYjAwMzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An abortion clinic worker with a special heritage is called upon to save the existence of humanity from being negated by two renegade angels trying to exploit a loop-hole and reenter Heaven.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-07T10:07:44Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001069/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bud Cort"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0001069?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Doe Jersey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0679465/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jared Pfennigwerth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0679465?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stygian Triplet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0137506/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "George Carlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0137506?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cardinal Glick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0008640/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Betty Aberlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0008640?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nun"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000255/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ben Affleck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0000255?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bartleby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000400/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Linda Fiorentino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0000400?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bethany"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0102965/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lesley Braden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0102965?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kissing Couple"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000413/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Janeane Garofalo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0000413?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Liz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352558/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Barret Hackney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0352558?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stygian Triplet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0757318/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kitao Sakurai"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0757318?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Stygian Triplet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0641168/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brian O'Halloran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0641168?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Grant Hicks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000354/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Matt Damon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0000354?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Loki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0262052/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dan Etheridge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0262052?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Priest at St. Stephen's"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0590502/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Derek Milosavljevic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0590502?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kissing Couple"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0639688/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Marie Elena O'Brien"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120655/characters/nm0639688?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Clinic Girl"}]}]}

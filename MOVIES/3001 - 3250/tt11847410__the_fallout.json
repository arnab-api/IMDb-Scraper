Megan Park is an established actress with some memorable roles (WHAT IF, 2013), and although she has directed some short films, this is her first feature film as writer-director. Her subject matter revolves around a school shooting and how it impacts students in so many ways. Rather than creating a project focusing on gun control, Ms. Park instead takes on the various emotions that occur after such a horrific event.\n\nVada (Jenna Ortega, young Jane in \"Jane the Virgin\") is a 16 year old high school student who is in the restroom when gunfire is heard. We don't see the shooter, and instead director Park sticks with Vada and Mia Reed (Maddie Ziegler) as they hide in the stall, terrified of what's happening. Mia is the school beauty, and one that Vada and her best friend Will (Nick Ropp) would typically make fun of behind her back. While in the stall, a bloody Quinton (Niles Fitch) joins them.\n\nThe three students form an unlikely bond after the shooting, as Will finds a new mission in life as an activist and spokesperson. Vada's parents are played by a skittish Julie Bowen and the always dependable John Ortiz. Vada and Mia both struggle with their emotions, and start to depend on each other. Quinton has serious fallout to deal with, though he and Vada get closer as well. Though she is unable to talk to her parents or deal with her younger sister, Vada does see a therapist played by Shailene Woodley.\n\nIt's painful to see anyone have to deal with such a horrific event, but it's so much worse when it's kids who simply aren't mature enough or experienced enough to handle such a burden. Wine, sex, and pot all make up the attempts at self-healing by the students, and the film doesn't shy away from the difficulties they face in returning to school - or returning to anything resembling normalcy after attending memorial services for numerous classmates. Filmmaker Park allows us to experience Vada's slow recovery, and then throws in a gut-punch of an ending that is likely to stun many. A terrific performance from Ms. Ortega and strong filmmaking from Ms. Park makes this one stick with us.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4911194/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jenna Ortega"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm4911194?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vada Cavell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2964567/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Niles Fitch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm2964567?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Quinton Hasland"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10500980/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lumi Pollack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm10500980?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Amelia Cavell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0100866/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Julie Bowen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm0100866?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Patricia Cavell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1264672/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Christine Horn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm1264672?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mrs. Victor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6795526/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Yindra Zayas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm6795526?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Megan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12418040/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Malcolm Santos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm12418040?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Justin Dragonas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4675650/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maddie Ziegler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm4675650?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mia Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5706089/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Will Ropp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm5706089?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nick Feinstein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0651159/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Ortiz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm0651159?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Carlos Cavell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940362/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Shailene Woodley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm0940362?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Anna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4847206/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Austin Zajur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm4847206?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dan Bonavure"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12418041/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Elliott Roca"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11847410/characters/nm12418041?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Social Worker"}]}]}

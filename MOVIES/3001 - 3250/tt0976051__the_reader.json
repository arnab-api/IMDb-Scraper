The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.\n\nThe second part is what most people, I assume, will remember about this film. Can \"Hanna Schmitz,\" a Nazi employee (so to speak), who was part of concentration camps, be a sympathetic character? To me, that's what it looked like that's the question the story was asking. The answer may have come in the final minutes of the movie when her ex-lover \"Michael Berg,\" now grown up and played by Ralph Fiennes, confronts a survivor of the camp. That, too, was very intense and interesting scene. Lena Olin is riveting as \"Rose/Illana Mather.\" \n\n\"The Reader\" was full of quiet, but intense scenes. This is a very thought-provoking film, especially for one that doesn't start off that way but look almost like some soft-porn flick to get our attention. It is anything but that.\n\nFor Germans, this film must bring out many emotions and thoughts. Guilt and forgiveness are just two of the issues that are dealt with in this unique film. \"Hanna Schmitz\" turns out to be an incredibly simple-yet-complex person, unlike any I've encountered on film in a long time. You see her in all kinds of light, both good and bad.\n\nKudos, too, to David Kross' acting as the young Michael Berg. It must be strange for someone his age (barely turned 18) to do the scenes he did with 30-something Winslet.\n\nOverall, a very different and excellent film that stays with you and makes you ponder its main characters.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Reader: Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1750597657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxODY1Mzc4MzdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2NTMxMzMx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxODY1Mzc4MzdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2NTMxMzMx._V1_.jpg", "description": "Post-WWII Germany: Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, a law student re-encounters his former lover (Winslet) as she testifies in a war-crimes trial.", "uploadDate": "2008-11-06T10:49:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000146/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ralph Fiennes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0000146?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Berg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1269088/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "David Kross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm1269088?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Young Michael Berg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0521443/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Susanne Lothar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0521443?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Carla Berg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1921479/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Florian Bartholom\u00e4i"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm1921479?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Thomas Berg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352278/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matthias Habich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0352278?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Peter Berg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0282302/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Marie-Anne Fliegel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0282302?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hanna's Neighbour"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0783397/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rainer Sellien"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0783397?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2185299/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Moritz Grove"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm2185299?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Holger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0354198/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeanette Hain"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0354198?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Brigitte"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000701/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kate Winslet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0000701?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hanna Schmitz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3048027/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alissa Wilms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm3048027?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Emily Berg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2337337/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Friederike Becht"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm2337337?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Angela Berg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0893458/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Frieder Venus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0893458?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Doctor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0036774/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hendrik Arnst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0036774?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Woodyard Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0584274/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Torsten Michaelis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0976051/characters/nm0584274?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sports Master"}]}]}

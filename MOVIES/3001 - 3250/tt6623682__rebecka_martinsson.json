Initially it looks as though the woman, the local vicar, died in an accident but evidence soon suggests otherwise. Rebecka gets involved in the investigation, sometimes going beyond what is strictly legal. Various suspects arise but when the killer is identified it comes as a surprise and leads to a tragic conclusion to the first story. After the series opener Rebecka is offered a job working as a local prosecutor before her planned move back to Stockholm in the summer. Further stories involve the murder of a woman connected to a local mining company; the death of two divers exploring a Nazi aircraft and the murder of a woman whose family has suffered a number of tragic 'accidents'.\n\nIn some ways this is a fairly traditional murder mystery series with its distinct stories that are wrapped up in two hours; however the events of one episode do have effects on characters that last beyond that story. There are also some fairly dark moments that will shock anybody expecting a Swedish 'Midsomer Murders'. Ida Engvoll does a fine job as our eponymous heroine making her believable even when she was breaking rules. Rebecka may be the title character but there are others who are almost as important; most notably police woman Anna Maria Mella and dog handler Krister Eriksson; Eva Melander and Jakob \u00d6hrman impress in these roles. There is plenty of great scenery to be seen without it feeling like it is being shown just to show us how beautiful the area is. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of Scandinavian drama who are looking for shorter stories than most such series that have aired here in the UK. I hope there is a second season.\n\nThese comments are based on watching the series in Swedish with English subtitles.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer [English SUB]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1170522393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBmZGYwNjMtNjQ1Yi00MDRiLWIyYmMtMWVhOGZkZDEzODUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBmZGYwNjMtNjQ1Yi00MDRiLWIyYmMtMWVhOGZkZDEzODUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-11-14T23:42:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0649619/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Thomas Oredsson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm0649619?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sven-Erik St\u00e5lnacke"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2514156/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eva Melander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm2514156?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anna Maria Mella"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0754024/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gunilla R\u00f6\u00f6r"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm0754024?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alva Bj\u00f6rnfot"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4224048/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ardalan Esmaili"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm4224048?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tommy Rantakyr\u00f6"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0297076/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Samuel Fr\u00f6ler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm0297076?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Carl von Post"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0408498/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jonas Inde"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm0408498?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Fredrik Ohlsson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0951596/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sascha Zacharias"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm0951596?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rebecka Martinsson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1732330/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jakob \u00d6hrman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm1732330?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Krister Eriksson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0899476/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ville Virtanen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm0899476?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lars Pohjanen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0511234/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lars Lind"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm0511234?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sivving Fj\u00e4llborg"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4206052/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ida Engvoll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm4206052?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rebecka Martinsson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0257025/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Niklas Engdahl"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6623682/characters/nm0257025?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "M\u00e5ns Wenngren"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2017"}]}]}

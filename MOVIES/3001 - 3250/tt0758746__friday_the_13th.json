For me they have always been guilty pleasures, but not something I would recommend to fans not into gory movies where there are occasional scares but no real suspense built up. After seeing this latest entry, which is really a remake of the first four films into one, I can't really say its bad. Horror movie fans who love creative killings will love it, but if you're not a horror movie fan of the slasher genre, then I really can't tell you to see this movie. However if this is your type of thing, go see it.\n\nNow on with the plot, which I really won't go into detail about because we already know what it's about. It starts off with a pitiful prelude that goes back to 1980 and found me rolling my eyes, but afterward it gets better. Young adults go camping, young adults die in nasty ways. THe one wrinkle added to the story is that one of the character's (Jared Padelecki from Supernatural on the WB) is brought into the story because he is looking for his sister. THis sister was involved with the first group of victims, and now there is this second group who know of nothing that has happened to the other group because it has been about six weeks since the first group went missing. You all know what happens next, so I won't say anything more.\n\nMost of the cast was competent, better then many of the ones from the earlier films. THere were a few who were annoying, but that is part of the Friday The 13th scenario. I like the new Jason because he is much more active in the role, much like the Jason from the 2nd and 3rd entries back in the early to mid 80s.\n\nI will give the movie a solid 7 out of 10. It went out and did what it was supposed to, but if you are more into the suspenseful horror films, and not hack and slash with a few jump scares, then Friday the 13th 2009 is not for you.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Friday the 13th: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3531670297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzQ2NTE1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUzMTYxMg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzQ2NTE1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUzMTYxMg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A group of young adults discover a boarded up Camp Crystal Lake, where they soon encounter Jason Voorhees (Mears) and his deadly intentions.", "uploadDate": "2008-12-10T11:56:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0655585/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jared Padalecki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm0655585?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clay Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1119462/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amanda Righetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1119462?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Whitney Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1683094/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aaron Yoo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1683094?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chewie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1838070/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jonathan Sadowski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1838070?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Wade"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1133651/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ben Feldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1133651?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Richie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1218621/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ryan Hansen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1218621?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nolan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1197383/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nick Mennell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1197383?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1049386/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kyle Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1049386?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Donnie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1263939/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Danielle Panabaker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1263939?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jenna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1670886/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Travis Van Winkle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1670886?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Trent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0575216/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Derek Mears"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm0575216?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jason Voorhees"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1566474/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Julianna Guill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1566474?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bree"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0260224/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Arlen Escarpeta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm0260224?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lawrence"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0969651/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Willa Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm0969651?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Chelsea"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1760388/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "America Olivo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0758746/characters/nm1760388?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Amanda"}]}]}

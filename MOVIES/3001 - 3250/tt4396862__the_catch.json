It reminded me a bit of The Thomas Crown Affair with the amazing attraction between the lead investigator and the sexy con artist. I had even persuaded friends to give it a try. So when it finally came out last month, I can't say enough how disappointed I was when I began watching. There seemed to be changes to the original trailer. So I went back and found that the original trailer I had seen was missing and another had replaced it. The original male lead had been replaced by Peter Krause and his female cohort was replaced by Sonya Walger. It seemed they have even changed the plot of the pilot. As I continued watching the first two episodes, I've found the feel of the show had been compromised in my opinion. To me, the chemistry between Enos and Krause just isn't quite the same as it was in that first trailer with Damon Dayoub. I love Mireille Enos and the rest of the cast. They are superb. But the show seems different than what it came across as originally and I almost feel like this was false advertising. Hope it can be salvaged.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Catch: Season 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi613924121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzNmNWM5MmUtZDE5NC00MzgzLThmZTgtN2QwZWZjN2VjMmRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzNmNWM5MmUtZDE5NC00MzgzLThmZTgtN2QwZWZjN2VjMmRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Catch: Season 2", "uploadDate": "2019-03-17T10:11:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0257969/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mireille Enos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm0257969?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alice Vaughan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2632545/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jay Hayden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm2632545?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Danny Yoon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0907427/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sonya Walger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm0907427?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Margot Bishop"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0799591/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Simm"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm0799591?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rhys"}, {"url": "#", "name": "15 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0868659/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gina Torres"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm0868659?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Justine Diaz"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0470244/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Peter Krause"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm0470244?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Benjamin Jones"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0738452/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rose Rollins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm0738452?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Valerie Anderson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1414227/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Elvy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm1414227?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sophie Novak"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1784515/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jacky Ido"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4396862/characters/nm1784515?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Agent Jules Dao"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}]}

No. Is it mildly ridiculous for a director to remake his own (admittedly awesome) movie into a t.v show? Sorta.\n\nThe first few episodes AFTER the pilot seem to drag a bit, and you're left seriously questioning whether all these discombobulated plot points are actually going anywhere. That and the fact that to anyone who's seen the movie, which probably 98% of the viewership has, it may feel like an overly long trip to the bloody fun you know is coming at the Titty Twister.. When this project was first announced, I was hesitant about the idea of essentially a remake of one of my favorite movies.. Even with Robert Rodriguez at the helm. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" was my sentiment... But alas, I stuck with the whole first season, trusting in my beloved RR that he had a real vision and purpose to expanding this story...And I'm glad I did.\n\nThe back half of the first season was phenomenal.. the actors are all settled into their parts by this point, and the expanded mythology starts to come together in very satisfying ways. It bears mentioning that the whole season is beautifully and excellently shot and edited. All practical effects are flawless. I can't wait for season 2, as it will be breaking new ground and getting past the plot of the original movie. It's on Netflix ppl, check it out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Exclusive Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1531293721", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5NTIyMTk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAxNzgxNjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5NTIyMTk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAxNzgxNjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In Season Two, the show travels between Mexico and the edgy, tricked-out Texas of Robert Rodriguez.

Whether it be a writer who  suffers from the dreaded writers block, an actor that can't seem to buy  a hit or a painter that can't seem to replicate the images in their  heads, the creative lulls affect all. Famed British director Ridley  Scott, the visionary master behind such classics as Alien, Blade Runner  and Gladiator has found himself in one of these creative dead zones,  but the most telling thing about his time in this lowly state is that  his been there for the better part of a decade and after witnessing his  new cashed up epic Exodus, it seems he is destined to remain there for  the foreseeable future.   Exodus is one of the most telling examples of storytelling mediocrity  overshadowing impeccable production values that I've ever seen and it  would be hard for anyone to argue against the pure visual value present  on screen in what is a clearly lavishly splurged upon epic. From  monuments through to the slums of the slave's right down to the extra  clad streets, Exodus brims to life with a detailed and often incredible  visual palette. While the wonders of the on screen production will  consistently make you look twice, there seems like such little point to  an exercise like this when all is surrounded by a script that never  allows us in, alongside Scott directing proceedings like a man that  wants to show off but not engage, direction more concerned with how to  spectacularly kill of horses than making the characters and story come  to life.   Much has been made in the media of late surrounding the casting of  actors in Exodus but more importantly to movie goers it's important to  know just how tame the acting turns are here. Christian Bale makes for  a watchable yet not entirely memorable Moses, his incarnation has  moments of brief humanity but he feels more a caricature than a living  breathing embodiment of one of the Bibles most well-known figures, we  feel tiny bits of the weight Moses had on his shoulders, yet our care  towards him remains dangerously low. On the other end of the spectrum  Australian Joel Edgerton (in perhaps his biggest Hollywood gig yet)  fails to deliver on what should've been a glorious big screen villain  in the form of Rhamses. All eyeliner and grizzled looks, Edgerton fails  to convince in his role and it feels from the get go that sadly he  may've been miscast much like John Turturoo's Seti, Aaron Paul's Joshua  and Ben Kinglsey's Nun, even the usually scene stealing Ben Mendelsohn  as Hegep fails to make much of a mark which leaves the film but a few  genuine moments of memorability, that being all largely related to the  onset of the plagues.   Impressive visuals, stunning sets and some genuinely wow inducing  moments concerning the plagues aren't enough to save this emotionally  void epic from a giant wave of the mundane. Scott sure knows how to  conduct his production department and his sweeping camera sure can  capture some outstanding action but the one time storyteller has lost  sight of how to portray his characters, how to play out a story and  Exodus looks set to become another Scott failure that looks likely to  underwhelm audiences as well as Box Office's the world over.   2 shades of eyeliner out of 5", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT2H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1381084953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjc2OTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk3OTU1MzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjc2OTc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk3OTU1MzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The defiant leader Moses rises up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues.", "uploadDate": "2014-11-28T21:30:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000288/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Christian Bale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0000288?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Moses"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001806/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Turturro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0001806?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Seti"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0578853/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ben Mendelsohn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0578853?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Viceroy Hegep"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000244/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sigourney Weaver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0000244?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tuya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5036576/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Isaac Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm5036576?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Malak"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0890055/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Indira Varma"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0890055?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "High Priestess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267042/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Golshifteh Farahani"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0267042?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nefertari"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001216/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tara Fitzgerald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0001216?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Miriam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0249291/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joel Edgerton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0249291?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ramses"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0666739/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aaron Paul"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0666739?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joshua"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1482999/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mar\u00eda Valverde"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm1482999?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Zipporah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001426/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ben Kingsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0001426?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nun"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007814/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hiam Abbass"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0007814?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bithia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001971/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ewen Bremner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm0001971?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Expert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1586095/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ghassan Massoud"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1528100/characters/nm1586095?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ramses' Grand Vizier"}]}]}

He works with his beloved wife and also scientist Evelyn Caster (Rebecca Hall) and his best friend is Dr. Max Waters (Paul Bettany). Dr. Caster is forced to go to a lecture to raise funds for their research but a group of anti-technology terrorists attack him and the two other authorities in the field of AI. Dr. Caster is poisoned and has only one month of life. When Will is near to death, Evelyn discusses with Max the possibility of transferring his emotions to the AI and they decide to try. They seem to be well succeeded, but they are attacked by the terrorists commanded by Bree (Kate Mara) that destroy the facility and Evelyn releases Dr. Caster's \"soul\" in the Internet to save him. Soon Dr. Caster controls the worldwide system and with his increasing knowledge, he changes human biology and the environment becoming an omnipresent power. But people are afraid of things they do not understand and Dr. Caster is considered a threat to the world that shall be destroyed.\n\n\"Transcendence\" is a sci-fi film with a promising premise, great cinematography, good performances and special effects but with a poorly written story with messy characters. Bree, for example, is a terrorist responsible for the death of Dr. Caster and his colleagues and for jump the gun and release Dr. Caster in the Internet by Evelyn to save him from her direct attack. In the end, she works with FBI Agent Buchanan (Cillian Murphy) and Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman). A subject of this magnitude should have been discussed by the Powers that Be, and not by a simple FBI agent, an outmoded scientist and a terrorist. I could write many other inconsistencies in the story, but better off let the viewer conclude by himself (or herself). My vote is five.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Transcendence - A Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o\" (\"Transcendence \u2013 The Revolution\")", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi586787609", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyOTUyMDc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcyNDgxMTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyOTUyMDc5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcyNDgxMTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Dr. Will Caster, the foremost researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence, is working to create a sentient machine that combines the collective intelligence of everything ever known with the full range of human emotions.

In their attempt to destroy Will, they inadvertently become the catalyst for him to succeed. For his wife Evelyn and best friend Max Waters, both fellow researchers, the question is not if they can...but if they should.

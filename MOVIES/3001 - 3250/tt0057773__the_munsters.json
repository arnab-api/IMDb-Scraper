Save for the cable-TV comedies, adventurous shows like \"The Munsters\" don't get made today. They went OUTSIDE, they drove around. Everything wasn't confined to the sets, although their house was a doozy and I loved it every time action took place down in Grandpa's basement. What a bunch of great characters these were (with kudos to Al Lewis and--God bless him--Fred Gwynne). Many of the episodes--such as the classic one where Eddie runs amok on a popular ghoul-TV program, \"Zombo\"--are still very pointed today, and just as funny. Herman's super strength was always good for a colorful sight-gag, Yvonne De Carlo's Lily was the perfect straight-face for Herman's antics.

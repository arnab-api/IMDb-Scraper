Whilst I didn't enjoy Noe's first film I Stand Alone, I loved Irreversible.\n\nThere is lots to like about ETV and much to dislike as well. An hour into the film and I would have given it perhaps an eight or nine but by the end of the film I was frustrated. Why? Noe just can't help himself and you get the feeling he either didn't know how to end the film or simply just wanted to be shocking for the sake of it.\n\nVisually, I couldn't help but be impressed. Some amazing shots, lighting (strobe) and editing techniques. Noe also mixes up the story well as he did in Irreversible. You are not spoon fed the story and I love the way he told the back story of the two leads.\n\nPlenty of people walked out at the screening after the hour and forty minute mark and I couldn't blame them. Probably not because they were shocked but just bored and frustrated. Noe pads this out and it is such a shame as overall it ruined the film as a whole.\n\nThe acting is quite wooden and doesn't ring true but that is only a minor quibble when compared to the film's bloated running time.\n\nHard to fault Noe for his creativity, energy and style and refusal to follow norms in terms of narrative structure etc. Still, I wish a friend or colleague had tapped him on the shoulder or given him some constructive criticism about the last half of the film.\n\nI can only imagine how much footage Noe might add into a Directors Cut - Lord help us. Perhaps he could learn some lessons from this and streamline his storytelling and not feel the need to bludgeon the audience just for the sake of it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Enter the Void", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2532115993", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNjc4NTY2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQxOTM3Mw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNjc4NTY2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQxOTM3Mw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A drug-dealing teen is killed in Japan, after which he reappears as a ghost to watch over his sister.", "uploadDate": "2010-08-12T06:43:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0209289/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paz de la Huerta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm0209289?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Linda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3026521/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cyril Roy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm3026521?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0849755/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Masato Tanno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm0849755?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mario"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3014840/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Emily Alyn Lind"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm3014840?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Little Linda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2918938/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nobu Imai"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm2918938?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tito"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3643889/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Janice B\u00e9liveau-Sicotte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm3643889?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3895973/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Stuart Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm3895973?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Victor's Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3857365/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rumiko Kimishima"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm3857365?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rumi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1140926/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nathaniel Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm1140926?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Oscar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2728054/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Olly Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm2728054?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Victor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3548147/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ed Spear"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm3548147?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bruno"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2998243/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jesse Kuhn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm2998243?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Little Oscar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3895050/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sakiko Fukuhara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm3895050?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Saki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0830767/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sara Stockbridge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm0830767?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Suzy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2879253/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Emi Takeuchi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1191111/characters/nm2879253?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Carol"}]}]}

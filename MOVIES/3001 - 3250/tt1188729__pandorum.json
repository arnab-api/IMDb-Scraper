It starts with two astronauts (Dennis Quaid , Ben Foster ) wake up from pods , they are solitaries and some has decimated the crew . One of them goes to explore the zone in where can live people no-infected . Meanwhile, the astronaut Bower attempting to survive , and he meets new survivors ( Antje Traue ,Norman Reedus, Cung Le ) hidden throughout the aircraft .Then, they encounter themselves chased by bloodthirsty,predatory monsters which have added them to his food chain. They must confront carnivorous mutants, hordes of warriors starving of human flesh and some of the most horrifying creatures ever made . The survivor group is surrounded , as they encounter a pack of carnivorous,crawling creatures that are waiting for them , facing their destruction and exposed to cruel bites by meat-eating sickos. They undertake a desperate fighting to survive and confronting each other.\n\nThis exciting picture contains thrills, chills, plot twists, action-filled with fierce fights and lots of gore and guts . The terror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized . The film turns out to be a crossover between psychological issues of crew from \u00a8 Event horizon\u00a8 , a certain similarity to the extraterrestrial attacks on the spacial corridors of \u00a8Alien saga \u00a8 , the weird monsters from \u00a8The descent\u00a8 and \u00a8Resident evil\u00a8 by Paul W. Anderson, here also producer , taking ideas here and there , resulting to be a fine movie . And of course the theme of people being stranded in a hostile, perilous environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of \u00a8Pitch black\u00a8 . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames . It's predictable but also its predictability is redeemed for some extraordinary surprises and in part by the charismatic acting from the main protagonists , Quaid and Foster . The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams, shocks and tension. The make-up assistants create the truly terrible cannibals. Horrifying and astonishing images about eerie events with deserted and threatening corridors , such as the creepy scenarios in the large spacial craft without barely people , and covered of metal and iron . Cool , dark cinematography by Wendigo who creates a perfect atmosphere and haunting musical score fitting to action and horror . The motion picture is surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Christian Alvart who subsequently would direct another good terror film as \u00a8Case 39\u00a8 .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pandorum: TV Spot #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi354026009", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzk3NjQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE2NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzk3NjQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE2NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A TV trailer for the movie Pandorum.", "uploadDate": "2009-09-04T09:36:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000598/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dennis Quaid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0000598?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Payton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1544217/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cam Gigandet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm1544217?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gallo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1087183/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cung Le"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm1087183?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Manh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005342/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Norman Reedus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0005342?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Shepard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447507/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Friederike Kempter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0447507?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Evalon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3084255/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Asia Luna Mohmand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm3084255?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Childhunter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0617852/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Wotan Wilke M\u00f6hring"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0617852?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young Bower's Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0195089/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Domenico D'Ambrosio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0195089?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Wounded Officer 'Eden'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004936/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ben Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0004936?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bower"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1662644/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Antje Traue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm1662644?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nadia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0745852/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Eddie Rouse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0745852?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Leland"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0377333/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Hennicke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0377333?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hunter Leader"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0773134/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Niels-Bruno Schmidt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0773134?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Insane Officer 'Eden'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0161046/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Delphine Chuillot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm0161046?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Young Bower's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3606206/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Julian Rappe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1188729/characters/nm3606206?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Young Bower"}]}]}

The names Peter Duncan and Andrew Knight as co-writers of much of the first 3 series' is generally a recipe for classy, tight writing. The concept, the delivery, the moral ambiguities, the lines nudged and then stepped over - it is all very, very Australian, and so typically modern Australia is it that perhaps it should not have been re-made with a US cast. The cast of this is universally brilliant, with Richard Roxburgh receiving a special mention from me, because any other actor may not have been able to walk that fine line between (almost) law-abiding citizen and absolute rogue, coming out after all his scrapes and gaol terms as someone we are prepared to forgive (almost) anything. The writing and acting of Cleaver Greene's relationship with his son is worth a special mention, in particular the odd turn this relationship takes in S.3 - just classic.\n\nI'll make mention also of the subject matter in Ep 5 of S.1, where Sam Neill guest stars with Heather Mitchell. It's the \"family dog\" episode, and on first viewing I thought, 'did I just see that, or did I imagine it?'. According to Charles Waterstreet, whose experiences as a Barrister in Sydney provided the inspiration for the character of Cleaver Greene, the case of the stolen DVD made by the good doctor and his wife was based upon a real life case. This is an instance of real life being far more outrageous than fiction.\n\nI can give this series - so far, at least - no less that 10/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Rake: Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2472196377", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNlZTA3NmQtNTc1NC00Yjk4LWI0NGQtNmU2OGYyMTcxZDBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNlZTA3NmQtNTc1NC00Yjk4LWI0NGQtNmU2OGYyMTcxZDBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Series Trailer for Rake", "uploadDate": "2017-10-19T16:11:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0746896/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Roxburgh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm0746896?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cleaver Greene"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 2010-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2094547/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kate Box"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm2094547?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nicole"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 2010-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1506789/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Adrienne Pickering"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm1506789?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Melissa Partridge"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2010-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0245873/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Russell Dykstra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm0245873?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Barney Meagher"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179996/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Danielle Cormack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm0179996?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Scarlet Meagher"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3891810/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Madeline Towns"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm3891810?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Zoe Meagher"}, {"url": "#", "name": "18 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206510/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matt Day"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm0206510?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Potter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 2010-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1363122/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Caroline Brazier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm1363122?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wendy Greene"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2010-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2294338/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Keegan Joyce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm2294338?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fuzz Greene"}, {"url": "#", "name": "33 episodes, 2010-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0960946/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Damien Garvey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm0960946?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cal McGregor"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 2012-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3891693/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tom Poulton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587000/characters/nm3891693?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Max Meagher"}, {"url": "#", "name": "19 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}]}

In fact, I thought her look was taken from a sad \"street person\" in Hollywood who, in her seventies, walked up and down Hollywood Boulevard in a pink ball-gown and dead blonde wig and thick makeup, speaking into a transistor radio she held to her ear -- in the 60s, long before cell phones -- \"talking\" to the FBI about people chasing her.\n\nPerhaps those who've spent their lives elsewhere, other than in Hollywood, feel that the characters in WEHTBJ? are \"over the top.\" But they're not.\n\nThat's what makes them so heartbreaking. And the incredibly brave performances by Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Victor Bono and the rest -- not to mention the script and Robert Aldrich's direction -- make this simply the most definitive \"Hollywood\" psycho-thriller since \"Sunset Boulevard.\"\n\nThere's \"A Star Is Born,\" in any of its incarnations. Which is also \"true\" in its (their) way.\n\nAnd there is \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"Baby Jane,\" which are even more true, and more brilliantly made.\n\nThese are not \"horror films.\" They are riveting psychological studies, cast with astonishing actors, and magnificently directed and photographed.\n\nThey are the equivalent of Hitchcock's \"Psycho,\" IMHO, which was preceeded by \"Sunset Boulevard\" and followed by \"Baby Jane.\"\n\nEach different, each brilliant, each marked by some of the most indelible performances ever captured on film.\n\nIt's typical of adolescents to make a \"joke\" about things that make them uncomfortable.\n\nBut when experience and age acquaint one with people like Baby Jane and Norma Desmond and, yes, Norman Bates, what's the point of joking?\n\nThese three films will tell those characters' stories forever, and better than 99% of films ever made.\n\nThat's why they're classics."}, "duration": "PT2H14M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi836895001", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZkNzY5NmItMWU1Mi00Yjk1LWIwNzctZGNiNTc3MzYyZWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZkNzY5NmItMWU1Mi00Yjk1LWIwNzctZGNiNTc3MzYyZWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-18T12:05:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000012/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bette Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0000012?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Baby Jane Hudson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0120658/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Victor Buono"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0120658?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edwin Flagg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0021610/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Julie Allred"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0021610?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Baby Jane Hudson, in 1917"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0071913/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Marjorie Bennett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0071913?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dehlia Flagg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496819/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Anna Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0496819?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mrs. Bates"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932565/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dave Willock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0932565?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ray Hudson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176773/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Russ Conway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0176773?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Police Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0180452/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Cornthwaite"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0180452?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dr. Shelby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001076/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joan Crawford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0001076?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Blanche Hudson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011741/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wesley Addy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0011741?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Marty Mc Donald"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0059091/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anne Barton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0059091?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cora Hudson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0293099/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bert Freed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0293099?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ben Golden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0635564/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maidie Norman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0635564?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Elvira Stitt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0017703/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "William Aldrich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0017703?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lunch Counter Assistant at Beach"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0178253/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Maxine Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056687/characters/nm0178253?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bank Teller"}]}]}

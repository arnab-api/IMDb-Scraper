I had loved the Dave Stevens comics since I first encountered them (ironically, at the same time I had read about Bettie Page in an article about Bunny Yeager, in a photography magazine).  The comic captured the spirit of 1930's aviation pulps, as well as the Doc Savage crowd.  It also brought along that Republic Studios flavor.  I couldn't wait to see this as a movie.\n\nThe movie captured the spirit of the comics beautifully.  Sure it was disappointing that Doc Savage couldn't be included, but Howard Hughes made a sensible substitution.  I was a bit annoyed that Disney felt they had to change Betty into Jenny, but with Jennifer Connelly in the role, I was in a forgiving mood.  The film was full of action and humor, cliffhangers and character; just like Stevens' creation.  If there was anything to criticize, it was the toning down of Betty/Jenny.  Yeah, I know, this is Disney, and she was far tamer in the comics than the real Betty/Bettie Page; but, hey, a guy can hope.\n\nBill Campbell was perfect for Cliff Secord.  He had that All-American look, with an impish twinkle in his eye.  Watching the movie, you could see the excitement when he was flying, and that he was head over heels in love with Jenny.\n\nAlan Arkin made a great Peevy, although he was far less cantankerous than his print counterpart (incidentally, Peevy was based on Doug Wildey, creator of Jonny Quest).  He was more of a Connecticut Yankee than grouchy mechanic.\n\nTimothy Dalton made a great pseudo-Errol Flynn.  I wasn't too happy that they trotted out that Flynn-as-Nazi Spy nonsense; but, it works beautifully for the story.  Paul Sorvino made a great 30's mobster, too.  Add Tiny Ron as Lothar, modeled after Rondo Hatton, and you have some pretty fun villains.\n\nThen, there's Jennifer Connelly, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood.  As I said, I had hoped for a little sexier character; but, the compromise was still pretty good.  Connelly brought both a wholesomeness and sex appeal to the role.  She looked great in the period clothing, too.\n\nEverything about this film worked.  The period detail was first rate, from the costumes, to he set design, to the slang.  The only thing that would have improved this would have been to make more films.  This is a great film for the whole family and captures the spirit of Republic and the pulps as well as Indiana Jones did."}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Rocketeer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1794703641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYyNTNjODAtYWY5Ni00YTQ5LWE2ZjMtMzFlMGNmNTkxNjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYyNTNjODAtYWY5Ni00YTQ5LWE2ZjMtMzFlMGNmNTkxNjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Rocketeer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:08:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001004/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Billy Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0001004?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cliff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000273/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alan Arkin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0000273?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peevy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000649/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paul Sorvino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0000649?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eddie Valentine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0491590/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ed Lauter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0491590?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Fitch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0592188/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Robert Miranda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0592188?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Spanish Johnny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0689237/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jon Polito"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0689237?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bigelow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0761836/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "William Sanderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0761836?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Skeets"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0221631/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nada Despotovich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0221631?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Irma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000124/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jennifer Connelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0000124?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001096/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Timothy Dalton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0001096?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Neville Sinclair"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642368/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Terry O'Quinn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0642368?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Howard Hughes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0359695/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James Handy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0359695?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wooly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0491696/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "John Lavachielli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0491696?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rusty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428008/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Eddie Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0428008?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Malcolm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0700130/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Don Pugsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102803/characters/nm0700130?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Goose"}]}]}

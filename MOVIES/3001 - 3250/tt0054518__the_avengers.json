It is still released onto video and watched by fans today; whether a new generation of fans has been introduced to it is unknown but I do know that people like myself who watched it the first time round are tuning in again.\n\nThe one constant through the series was Patrick Macnee who played John Steed. He was joined by various females throughout the show (my favourite being the lovely Emma Peel played by Diana Rigg).\n\nThe show was full of wit in addition to the action, intrigue and adventure. Steed-in his bowler hat and with his umbrella-faced all kinds from mad scientists to robots. Always calm, Steed brought down his foes usually with the help of his bowler hat or umbrella.\n\nWhat more can I say about The Avengers? It was unique, it was funny and it has stood the test of time very well."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Avengers: Dead On Course", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3585326361", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGFlNWMxODMtYTIyOS00MjY5LTk4ZDQtYmZlNjZiYmI4ZjZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGFlNWMxODMtYTIyOS00MjY5LTk4ZDQtYmZlNjZiYmI4ZjZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Avengers: Dead On Course", "uploadDate": "2019-03-15T00:16:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001495/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Patrick Macnee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054518/characters/nm0001495?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Steed"}, {"url": "#", "name": "161 episodes, 1961-1969"}]}]}

There's Renny Harlin on one end of the spectrum, making crap like The Legend of Hercules, 12 Rounds, and The Covenant. But then you have someone like Jaume Collet-Serra, who knows a thing or two about framing a scene, getting good performances from his actors, and above all, making an entertaining movie.\n\nThe Shallows could have been an otherwise conventional and forgettable thriller without Collet-Serra's strong and stylish direction. For example, the scene when Blake Lively's character first gets attacked by the shark is beautifully composed - in one unbroken take, no less - and legitimately nightmarish, with the red blood slowly overtaking the blue screen. It also doesn't hurt that Lively successfully carries the entire film on her shoulders, giving what is arguably the best performance in her career to date. There's a quiet fierceness and admirability to her character that makes it easy to root for her survival.\n\nOverall, there's a lot to like about The Shallows. It's gorgeously shot, suspenseful, emotionally gratifying, and entirely successful on what it sets out to be - a solid B-movie, and it takes skill to pull that off. Sure, it doesn't match the heights of either Gravity or The Martian, but then again, its budget is a mere fraction of what those films cost.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H26M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"The Beginning\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3966088217", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNTY4Nzg3MDleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYwNDczMTkx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzNTY4Nzg3MDleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYwNDczMTkx._V1_.jpg", "description": "A mere 200 yards from shore, surfer Nancy is attacked by a great white shark, with her short journey to safety becoming the ultimate contest of wills.", "uploadDate": "2016-06-10T06:16:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0515116/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Blake Lively"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm0515116?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nancy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8395137/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Angelo Josue Lozano Corzo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm8395137?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Surfer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0191442/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brett Cullen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm0191442?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8238079/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pablo Calva"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm8238079?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8238080/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Janelle Bailey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm8238080?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8257931/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chelsea Moody"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm8257931?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Young Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1049982/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "\u00d3scar Jaenada"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm1049982?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carlos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8238078/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joseph Salas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm8238078?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Surfer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7529788/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sedona Legge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm7529788?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chloe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5362879/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Diego Espejel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm5362879?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Intoxicated Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8257930/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ava Dean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm8257930?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Young Nancy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8257932/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sully Seagull"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4052882/characters/nm8257932?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sully 'Steven' Seagull"}]}]}

Even though my adoration of the late comedian precludes me from giving a impartial rating of this movie, I can at least admit that this isn't one of his best efforts (I still loved this movie, it's just not my favourite Farley flick).  Nevertheless, I'm going to take the easy way out and say: Come on, take it for what it is, a Chris Farley movie.\n\nFarley plays Haru, an orphan adopted at birth by a clan of ninjas.  He is raised under the pretenses that he is the Great White Ninja. Needless to say, his development is much anticipated by his teachers .  Unfortunately, to the dismay of everyone, he grows up to be overweight and klutzy. While the ninja graduates are out celebrating, Haru finds himself alone at the retreat when a mysterious woman (Nicollette Sheridan) enters looking for help.  Believing Haru to be a ninja, she hires him to spy on her boyfriend, an assignment he accepts with great enthusiasm.  Hot on the boyfriend's trail, Haru witnesses a murder and eventually ends up in Beverly Hills. Surviving on dumb luck and a designated guardian ninja, Haru never gives up on his task.\n\nLike I said before, this isn't Farley's greatest contribution to his comedic resume. But make no mistake, this is a funny movie.  Farley's bread and butter is his propensity to bumble and stumble in any given situation - walking into poles, falling down stairs, crushing coffee tables, etc. Since his character is expected to be agile and sleek, the comedy in \"Beverly Hills Ninja\" is that much funnier.  The exact same formula worked for Farley's SNL character Barney, the Chippendale's hopeful.\n\nMany critics felt that, by this time, Farley was a one-trick-pony whose act had nothing more to offer than jokes involving head and groin injuries. Perhaps his choice in films were poor but to don't deny him the recognition of his talent is unfair. Watch the movie and you'll see Farley display all the qualities of a great comedian: intelligence, timing, pathos.  He was a tremendous talent and I will miss him very much.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Beverly Hills Ninja", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi112853273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI0NjBlOGMtYWUwYS00ZjMyLWFlN2YtMjNjNTYyMTYwZWNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI0NjBlOGMtYWUwYS00ZjMyLWFlN2YtMjNjNTYyMTYwZWNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:32:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000394/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Farley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0000394?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Haru"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0795225/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robin Shou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0795225?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gobei"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0644902/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Soon-Tek Oh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0644902?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sensei"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001674/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Rock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0001674?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411113/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dale Ishimoto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0411113?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Old Japanese Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0120235/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Burt Bulos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0120235?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mr. Ozaru"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0047520/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tom Bailey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0047520?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Billy's Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0459658/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Richard Kline"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0459658?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001733/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nicollette Sheridan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0001733?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Allison Page"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0001733?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sally Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0662511/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nathaniel Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0662511?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Martin Tanley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177455/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Keith Cooke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0177455?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nobu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0154236/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Chau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0154236?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Izumo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0155201/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Daming Chen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0155201?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Head Kobudosai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0087193/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Curtis Blanck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0087193?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Billy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0864937/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jason Tobin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118708/characters/nm0864937?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Busboy"}]}]}

Google is actually a very odd work environment, and the movie makes good points about the depressed state of our modern employment climate for young and old alike. I think the movie tried a little TOO hard to polarize a traditional salesman with the high tech digital age, and some of the Vince Vaughn joke sequences seemed to get a bit tedious. But he played it so seriously that the overall effect was still amusing.\n\nThe Vaughn / Wilson pair were VERY sufficiently embarrassing with their overzealous attempts at being team players in projects they didn't understand, and as I have worked deep in the internet business since 1996 I cringed harder than the Google interns who tried to cope with them. I was already a Director level manager in the internet when Google was just being founded, so I've watched the company grow from the ground up, and eventually sponge up the mega-companies that produced my primary worktools (such as Doubleclick). Having been interviewed for management level jobs at Google I can vouch that they can crawl up your ying-yang about your academic record, even if it's from the 80's and you have over a decade of real quality experience to replace it. I've been interviewed by Facebook, Yahoo and Amazon too, and only Facebook can take after Google in this way. It creates the perception of being the Mensa Society of the digital world - pretentious, exclusive, and only for IQ's higher than 170.\n\nThat is not really the case, strictly speaking, but there is a culture there of self-importance that the movie bounced our heroes off of, and it worked for some laughs.\n\nAll in all it was an enjoyable matin\u00e9e break, but I probably won't be getting it on Blu-ray.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1707648537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA2NDk1MzQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA5NDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA2NDk1MzQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA5NDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital age find their way into a coveted internship at Google, where they must compete with a group of young, tech-savvy geniuses for a shot at employment.", "uploadDate": "2013-04-20T07:32:32Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000681/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vince Vaughn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm0000681?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Billy McMahon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0126284/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rose Byrne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm0126284?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1540404/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Max Minghella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm1540404?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Graham Hawtrey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3729721/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dylan O'Brien"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm3729721?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Stuart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5111695/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tobit Raphael"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm5111695?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Yo-Yo Santos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1221906/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jessica Szohr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm1221906?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Marielena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2765191/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Eric Andr\u00e9"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm2765191?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930637/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gary Anthony Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm0930637?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bob Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005562/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Owen Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm0005562?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nick Campbell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0541902/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aasif Mandvi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm0541902?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mr. Chetty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3091777/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Josh Brener"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm3091777?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1587188/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tiya Sircar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm1587188?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Neha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1265802/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Josh Gad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm1265802?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Headphones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1443527/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rob Riggle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm1443527?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Randy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2957490/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Harvey Guill\u00e9n"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2234155/characters/nm2957490?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Zach"}]}]}

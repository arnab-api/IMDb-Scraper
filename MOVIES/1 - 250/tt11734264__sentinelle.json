It's a French film, and they usually don't pull their punches, then it's action and French action movies, when well done, are the best, and finally it starred Olga Kurylenko, who is a talented actress, not to mention really good looking. I mean, she's 40 and she looks 27.\n\nYet the whole movie is following this trained soldier fighting random people in order to get to her target. The entire story of the film is that one sentence. And the fight scenes were good, but far between, and too often they started from a careful and silent exploration of a building and some guy suddenly coming out of nowhere. The rest was boring and didn't make much sense. I do hope in France they don't take PTSD soldiers with an opioid addiction, arm them with Famas and let them roam wherever they want, even when wanted by the police and when they know where she's headed. The characters: all formulaic and most were superfluous. When they were not, they had a lot of extra characteristics not used anywhere. For example Olga's character knows five foreign languages - I expected her to put that to use, but it was just a random fact.\n\nThe worst, though, was the ending. In order to make it a bit longer, they had the bad guy escape once, only to be killed a few minutes later, when the target of one hour and twenty minutes was reached.\n\nBottom line: a failed film that doesn't know what it wants to be.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1572782105", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQxNThiNGQtMGIwYi00N2U3LWI3YWMtN2RmYjI5ZmQ3NjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQxNThiNGQtMGIwYi00N2U3LWI3YWMtN2RmYjI5ZmQ3NjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-03-03T08:57:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1385871/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Olga Kurylenko"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm1385871?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Klara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3465625/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michel Nabokoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm3465625?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Leonod Kadnikov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2925389/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Carole Weyers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm2925389?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Capitaine Catherine Muller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9946750/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gabriel Almaer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm9946750?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Armurier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7580719/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Guillaume Duhesme"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm7580719?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lieutenant Colonel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7668459/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mustapha Makhada"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm7668459?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "P\u00e8re Syrien"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0557185/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Olivier Massart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm0557185?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "M\u00e9decin de Tania"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0255562/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Alain Eloy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm0255562?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "M\u00e9decin militaire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6725563/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marilyn Lima"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm6725563?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tania"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2953208/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Martin Swabey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm2953208?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lieutenant Eric Jaubert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11630939/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Andrey Gorlenko"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm11630939?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Yvan Kadnikov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11469999/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Blaise Afonso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm11469999?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Soldat op\u00e9ration Sentinelle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7754761/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Michel Biel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm7754761?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Aur\u00e9lien"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0757526/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Erico Salamone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm0757526?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Patron du Millenium"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10352759/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Doriane Pasquale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11734264/characters/nm10352759?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jeune femme plage"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["France"], "Language": ["French", "Arabic", "Russian"], "Release Date": ["5 March 2021 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Sentinelle"], "Filming Locations": ["Brussels, Belgium"], "Budget": ["EUR6,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Production Co": ["Labyrinthe Films"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby SR"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

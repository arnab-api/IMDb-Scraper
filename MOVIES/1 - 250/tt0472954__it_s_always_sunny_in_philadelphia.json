It's compared to South Park for a number of reasons, most notably the enthusiasm with which it tackles socially sensitive issues and assaults them with the most extremist brands of political incorrectness --- but whereas South Park always tries to tidy up it's mess and make sure the audience knows the distinction between right and wrong, this show revels in the depravity and insanity of it's sociopathy. And it works amazingly well.\n\nSince it's a situational comedy, there's not much to say about it without giving away the goods, but the actors all work better than any cast I've seen in a long time. It really seems like half the show is improvised and that the cast is talented enough to make it work without a hitch. The first few episodes are definitely the weakest, but still stronger than just about any comedy out there.\n\nHighly recommended.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 11 Teaser - \"Ideas\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi611693081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNzUzMjc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYxNTM1NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNzUzMjc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYxNTM1NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 11 teaser for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on FXX.", "uploadDate": "2015-12-22T13:05:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206359/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlie Day"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472954/characters/nm0206359?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlie Kelly"}, {"url": "#", "name": "154 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0568390/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rob McElhenney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472954/characters/nm0568390?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mac"}, {"url": "#", "name": "154 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000362/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Danny DeVito"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472954/characters/nm0000362?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Frank Reynolds"}, {"url": "#", "name": "147 episodes, 2006-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1097351/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Glenn Howerton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472954/characters/nm1097351?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dennis Reynolds"}, {"url": "#", "name": "154 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0647698/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kaitlin Olson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472954/characters/nm0647698?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dee Reynolds"}, {"url": "#", "name": "154 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["4 August 2005 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["It's Always Sunny on TV"], "Filming Locations": ["Geno's Steaks, 1219 S. 9th St., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA"], "Production Co": ["Bluebush Productions", "3 Arts Entertainment", "FX Productions"], "Runtime": ["22 min"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

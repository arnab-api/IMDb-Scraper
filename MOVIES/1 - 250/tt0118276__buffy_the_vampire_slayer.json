It wasn't that well-known in Germany at this time and, come on, \"Buffy- The Vampire Slayer\", what kind of title is that? It seemed to have a quite large fanbase and so, one day, I started to watch an episode. From than on, i couldn't stop. Despite the wacky premise of a highschool-girl hunting vampires, i had great fun watching it. I liked the characters. Buffy, the titular character herself was a lot more fleshed out than i expected, and by the end of the first season, i had a feeling that i kinda related to her. How many times can a man in his mid-twenties say that he relates to a highschool girl that kills vampires? The secondary characters were even better, they were relatable, they were funny and you could really feel with them. The dialogue and jokes were brilliant, i laughed out loud quite some times. When the story got tragic, most memorable in the episode \"the body\", i couldn't help but cry a little with the protagonists, something that happens to me very rarely in movies or series. I even feel kinda sad just writing about it right now. Other episodes like \"Hush\" got really scary, something i deemed impossible in a series mainly for teenagers. Of course, some episodes are not as good as others, but the self-awareness, the tongue-in-cheek humour, the characters and sheer creativity of many of the episodes makes easily up for it. And while the underlying moral of some episodes is a bit too open, other episodes really make you think about it.\n\nSo when i finally reached the finale of season 7, i had the feeling that i had been on a very satisfying journey alongside the characters, having cried with them, having laughed with them, and, most importantly having a ton of great fun. Something i can only recommend to everyone willing to indulge in it.\n\nAnd when its over, you can always watch it again.

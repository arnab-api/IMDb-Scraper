I find all the characters in the show top rate and believable....except for Megan Boone and the character Elizabeth. This character is so sanctimonious and self centered it just grates against my nerves.This character does anything she \"feels\"is the best thing even if it's against protocol and puts the team in danger. Then berates Reddington, who is actually helping her, because he colors outside the lines.The fact that the show went from an interesting \"get the really bad guys\" show to all about \"Lizzy\" has gotten really very annoying and is starting to get old. There are 6 other characters to shed some focus on. I understand the background story between her and Reddington is important....I get that. But all the drama and, not to mention, all the dumb selfish things Elizabeth does is really starting to be a turn off. Whoever the writer is for this character needs to be fired. Also, what's up with Lizzy's miraculous healing powers? She can get punched in the face by a man and not only get up right away, but never has a scratch on her. She should have had black eyes for at least a couple of weeks. Everybody else on the show gets realistically (believably) injured and goes through the healing process. But not cast iron Lizzy. Come on guys, give it a rest. Please don't turn a great show of intrigue,espionage and edge of your seat stories into a soap opera with a bad leading actress. I TRULY want to continue watching this show. Needless to say, this is why I gave a 9 rating instead of a 10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3 Preview", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi302822169", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MjYxNTcxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3Nzc4NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MjYxNTcxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3Nzc4NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 3 preview for The Blacklist on NBC.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-24T13:19:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000652/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Spader"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2741602/characters/nm0000652?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Raymond 'Red' Reddington"}, {"url": "#", "name": "168 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1459109/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Diego Klattenhoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2741602/characters/nm1459109?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Donald Ressler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "168 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1399346/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hisham Tawfiq"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2741602/characters/nm1399346?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dembe Zuma"}, {"url": "#", "name": "165 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2236560/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mozhan Marn\u00f2"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2741602/characters/nm2236560?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Samar Navabi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "103 episodes, 2014-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1443644/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Megan Boone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2741602/characters/nm1443644?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Elizabeth Keen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "168 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0502015/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Harry Lennix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2741602/characters/nm0502015?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Harold Cooper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "167 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1682276/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Amir Arison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2741602/characters/nm1682276?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aram Mojtabai"}, {"url": "#", "name": "163 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2375297/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ryan Eggold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2741602/characters/nm2375297?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tom Keen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["23 September 2013 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Blacklist"], "Filming Locations": ["Pleasantville, New York, USA"], "Production Co": ["Davis Entertainment", "Universal Television", "Sony Pictures Television"], "Runtime": ["43 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "DTS", "(HD MA)\u00a0(blu-ray)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

I hadn't heard of the book. I hadn't seen any previews or descriptions. What i found was a pleasantly dark show. It's uncomfortable and unpredictable and has what is hopefully an amazing story to tell from a unique perspective.\n\nWe're put into the head of a stalker who seems to be a hair's width away from violence. The tension is held well.\n\nBut what REALLY made it feel uncomfortable for me was a rather odd choice from the network. Swearing is censored out. There are these conspicuous blanks in the dialogue. It had me obsessing. When you've got a show this dark, who the hell do they think they're going to offend with a little swearing? Are they expecting kids to be up watching it? It's content is far more offensive than swearing could ever be.\n\nApart from that one VERY annoying point, it's a brilliantly put together show. I'm looking forward to watching more (though I'll probably find myself swearing at the TV about the missing dialogue).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi152878873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM3MzkyNGItZWE0ZC00MzJhLTgxODItYTRhOTFlOTJmYzA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM3MzkyNGItZWE0ZC00MzJhLTgxODItYTRhOTFlOTJmYzA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Meet Will Bettelheim.

Nowadays there's usually not that much in the way of mystery shows on (US) TV anymore--cop shows, sure, but mysteries? And while ER is certainly a quality show, I never really cared that much for it either--too much like a daytime soap but with blood. \"House,\" however, seems a nice combo of medicine, mystery, and character. Hugh Laurie's Dr. House is someone you feel guilty loving because he's so arrogant and callous, but he keeps you entertained because you can't wait to hear what he'll say next. House loves to tell the truth as he sees it, cutting through the nice happy lies that your average urban US adult tells and believes, never mind the hurt feelings he might leave lying bleeding by the roadside. But of course, his character *may* hide a heart of gold, so in the end he's trying to do the right thing. Sure, it's a formula, and House is even a stock character maybe, but it works.\n\nIf the creators/writers are smart, they'll allow a little character development, especially amongst the excellent supporting cast, but not ruin it by changing House or allowing him a romance with either of his female costars. Keep that sexual tension going!\n\nFor fun, catch Hugh Laurie--who is British by the way--sometime on one of the seasons of Black Adder (usually rebroadcast on PBS, but also available at better video rental shops). He plays a complete idiot and is as convincing in that role as he is as the brilliant and misanthropic Dr. House. . ."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "House: Season Eight", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi51488537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMyODQ1YTItMjdiZi00M2UyLWFjZGQtNTk3YWI4NTQ5ZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMyODQ1YTItMjdiZi00M2UyLWFjZGQtNTk3YWI4NTQ5ZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for House: Season Eight", "uploadDate": "2013-01-27T06:18:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0491402/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hugh Laurie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm0491402?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Gregory House"}, {"url": "#", "name": "176 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000494/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Sean Leonard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm0000494?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. James Wilson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "174 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0249046/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lisa Edelstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm0249046?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. Lisa Cuddy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "153 episodes, 2004-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0607185/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jennifer Morrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm0607185?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dr. Allison Cameron"}, {"url": "#", "name": "130 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1312575/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Olivia Wilde"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm1312575?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Thirteen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "81 episodes, 2007-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004898/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Omar Epps"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm0004898?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Eric Foreman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "174 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0817980/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jesse Spencer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm0817980?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Robert Chase"}, {"url": "#", "name": "171 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0075061/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bobbin Bergstrom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm0075061?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nurse"}, {"url": "#", "name": "134 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0414772/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter Jacobson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0412142/characters/nm0414772?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Chris Taub"}, {"url": "#", "name": "96 episodes, 2007-2012"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["16 November 2004 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["House"], "Filming Locations": ["Princeton University's Frist Campus Center"], "Production Co": ["Heel & Toe Films", "Shore Z Productions", "Bad Hat Harry Productions"], "Runtime": ["44 min", "7,788 min", "(Entire series)"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "Dolby Digital", "(Dolby 5.1)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

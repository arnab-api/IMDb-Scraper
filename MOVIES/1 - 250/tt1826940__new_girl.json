I watch quite a few shows (way too many) and this one genuinely gets a smile on my face without cheap tricks, fake laughter, annoying punchline tunes trying to convince me what just happened was funny. \n\nThe main characters in this show are already memorable in the pilot, they just have chemistry straight away. A lot of shows that I really love now didn't start off as well as 'New Girl' has for me.\n\nThe 'formula' feels fresh to me, I haven't seen this show before in another form and I absolutely love Zoey in this. Her personality in this show is exactly why I fall in love in real life. Just watched the third episode and I'll be sure to tune in next week!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 New Girl--What's New", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1436923417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2016-09-10T03:58:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0221046/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Zooey Deschanel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1826940/characters/nm0221046?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jess Day"}, {"url": "#", "name": "146 episodes, 2011-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339011/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Max Greenfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1826940/characters/nm0339011?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Schmidt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "146 episodes, 2011-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2031358/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lamorne Morris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1826940/characters/nm2031358?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Winston Bishop"}, {"url": "#", "name": "145 episodes, 2011-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2159926/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jake Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1826940/characters/nm2159926?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nick Miller"}, {"url": "#", "name": "146 episodes, 2011-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1924196/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hannah Simone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1826940/characters/nm1924196?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cece Parekh"}, {"url": "#", "name": "146 episodes, 2011-2018"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["20 September 2011 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Chicks and Dicks"], "Filming Locations": ["Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Elizabeth Meriwether Pictures", "American Nitwits", "Chernin Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["22 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby", "(Dolby Surround)", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

All of the hate this series got was completely unwarranted, and it came from those who only watched the first half season. Ever since then, AOS has been on the up; improving every season. Sure, it might have a slow and lackluster start, but Agents of Shield gets progressively better as you continue through the series. And the improvement is so drastic that this has become one of the best TV shows I've ever seen.\n\nOne of the most special aspects of this show is how it ties into the MCU. Out of all of Marvel's TV shows (Pre-Wandavision and the other Disney+ shows), Agents of Shield is most affected by, and most connected with the Marvel movies. I can't stress enough how enjoyable it is to watch this series alongside the movies; it is the perfect companion. Only problem being, you'll be annoyed at how the movies rarely recognize the show; which sadly leaves the show in a sort of limbo in terms of its canonicity in the main MCU timeline.\n\nSeason 4 of Agents of Shield is the real point where you realize just how incredible the show is. It is definitely one of the best seasons of a TV show that I have ever seen, and I've seen many shows. From the likes of what's largely considered some of TV's best: Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, etc. And also other superhero shows, such as; Daredevil, The Punisher, Jessica Jones, etc. Agents of Shield stands tall amongst these, and season 4 is must-watch TV - not just for fans of Marvel, but any Sci-Fi fans. The real strength of the phenomenal season 4 being, the amount of story arcs put into 1 season, and how well they are all fleshed out. It's fast paced, interesting, and emotional. Other seasons after are just as good, but the quality never eclipses that of season 4's in my opinion.\n\nThe cast, and the characters they play, are fantastic; and Clark Gregg is the great leader needed for a show like this. I'm happy that they went through with giving the character of Coulson a TV show after the events of the first Avengers, because Agent Coulson in my eyes, is one of Marvel's biggest stars.\n\nTo all those that denounced this show, give it another chance. Watch the show from the beginning with the knowledge that it just gets better with time, and you will not be disappointed.\n\nMy Rating: 9/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 7 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3152657945", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNkMTk5ZDQtNmQzNC00M2IzLTgzMjUtMmQwYjYwNjFjZjUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNkMTk5ZDQtNmQzNC00M2IzLTgzMjUtMmQwYjYwNjFjZjUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are bending the laws of space and time.

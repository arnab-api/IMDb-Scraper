The plots are engaging, the cast interacts well together, and nobody comes off as being too \"preachy,\" as you get with some of the CSIs and Law & Orders.\n\nThanks for the opportunity to support a fine show which is up against some tough competition. I watched \"Lost\" quite a bit it's first season, but finally got bored with it because it never seemed to have any resolution. Just episode upon episode of wondering why it wasn't going anywhere. In other words, \"Lost\" lost me! And I'm starting to get that same feeling with \"Desperate Housewives,\" too. When I was a kid I really enjoyed ongoing serials; but not that much anymore.... \n\nShows like Criminal Minds and Numbers and NCIS manage to make you think you've watched a complete story; and from my point of view, I respond to that kind of entertainment much, much better!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Criminal Minds: Drive", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2969812249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MmQ5NjctOWM2OS00NDMxLWFlNmYtZTAzNGFkMjIzZmUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MmQ5NjctOWM2OS00NDMxLWFlNmYtZTAzNGFkMjIzZmUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Criminal Minds: Drive", "uploadDate": "2019-04-12T04:25:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1131557/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matthew Gray Gubler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452046/characters/nm1131557?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Spencer Reid"}, {"url": "#", "name": "323 episodes, 2005-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176882/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "A.J.

There is a whitewash removal of reviews that note core factual problems with the film's narrative. My review referenced Washington Post and New York Times articles showing several major untruths in this film, including outright untruths told by Mohamedou in his book.\n\nMy review had had no \"spoilers\" bad language or untruths, yet it was removed. My review did not rationalize torture, nor did it defend Guantanamo that Bush had opened and that Obama never closed despite promises to do so. I also included statements on this case from top Obama administration officials, several of whom are now top Biden administration officials who stated that that Mohamedou was an Al Quada terrorist and needed to be kept locked up.\n\nI think people are marking as \"spoiler\" reviews that they simply do not like.

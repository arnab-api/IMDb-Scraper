Like ever. Don't get me wrong FRIENDS is historic in its own place & I've binged that a lot too but Seinfeld just edges it for me.\n\nJason Alexander, you legend. George Costanza is the character that you see nowadays sitcoms are trying to pull off but they just can't. He's One of a kind. Just like Joey & Chandler. They are in a league of their own.\n\nI review rarely and this is my first review & I'm sounding like i should be giving Seinfeld 10/10 but I've settled with 9. The reason for that is i base my rating simply on 3 factors: 1) Characters 2) Storyline 3) Screenplay i.e. length of how long a show is keeping me attached to the screen before i lose interest.\n\nSo for George, Kramer, Jerry i give it a perfect 10. But when it comes to Elaine, she's so lame. As a character, as a person i don't get her. Beauty of me binging Seinfeld is that I've chopped off her parts from all episodes. She's terrible, irritating and hardly makes me laugh. Writers haven't even attached background applause to her wise cracks. Downpoint of the show. 'Elame' Benes.\n\nTo shed a light on Jerry & Kramer, well they are the lifeblood of the show. Their chemistry makes you laugh. Kramer is very underrated. Also, Jerry & George's coffee shop chemistry. Those scenes are hilarious & refreshing. You'd never get bored watching their riddled lifestyles.\n\nThat's all, its a must watch. Even if sitcoms ain't your genre i think you must give this a try no matter what. It's just that good. And yes, first 2 seasons are a bit downer but important to watch for you to establish those characters. From season 3 you'd love the stories & start getting used to it. By season 5 & 6 you'd literally crack yourself up.\n\nBEST SITCOM EVER MADE HANDS DOWN. Effortless entertainment. Once you watch it, mark my words you're gonna binge it. P.S: I've already crossed the 3-figures binge watching it and currently rewatching it for 183rd time. Love this show to bits.

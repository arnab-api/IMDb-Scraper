First of all if you're in dilemma of deciding whether should watch it or not then put your doubts aside and give it a go, you will not regret it . This is one of the best show I have ever seen. The story is very well written and it's surpassed only by the acting of the cast involved. Simon Baker's performance in The Mentalist is nothing short of spectacular, he brought the character of Patrick Jane to life. A well balanced protagonist that is smart, sexy and have a good sense of humour, plus Patrick's background story is so emotionally strong that you can't help yourself to connect with it in a deeper way. The chemistry between Simon Baker and Robin Tunney's character is portrayed so well by these two, and their amazing friendship off-screen is reflected on the show in a wonderful way. Jane and Lisbon's relationship is truly one of the most beautiful relationships ever written for TV. But, it's not just them you feel attached to. You'll get fascinated by the tricks of a Mentalist. He is witty, sarcastic, arrogant at times, manipulative and extremely intelligent with an extraordinary IQ and memory. He is gonna trap you into his wide skills of observation, manipulation, cold reading, mind bending tricks & ideas. The way he solves the cases is magnificent to watch and so so intriguing. I can ever go as far as to say that his intelligent surpasses that of Sherlock Holmes. This guy can literally get inside the minds of the smartest & the toughest criminals and manipulate them to do things his way. He can get inside Joker's head and make him commit suicide, yes you heard it right. Such is the mind of a brilliant man, Patrick Jane, the main protagonist. You're gonna love him every single moment of the show. Won't give you any spoilers or anything but a great show needs a great antagonist, & it can't get any better than Red John. From the suspense regarding his true identity, to the mind games between him and Patrick, all of it is presented so well to keep you intrigued for the entire course of show. And even after Red John this show is a delight to watch. And I dare say that I have finally found a show with the PERFECT ENDING. A show can not get a better closure than this . The only thing sad about the ending was the fact in itself that the show was ending. Now it's hard for me to imagine a day without watching The Mentalist. It's gonna stay with the watcher forever. Thank you Bruno Heller for giving us this masterpiece.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Exclusive", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4252282393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMzNTU2MjEzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc5MTg0NDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMzNTU2MjEzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc5MTg0NDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch exclusive scenes from the finale of \"The Mentalist.\"", "uploadDate": "2015-02-18T11:51:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0048932/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Simon Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1196946/characters/nm0048932?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Patrick Jane"}, {"url": "#", "name": "151 episodes, 2008-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1085727/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tim Kang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1196946/characters/nm1085727?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kimball Cho"}, {"url": "#", "name": "151 episodes, 2008-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1119462/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Amanda Righetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1196946/characters/nm1119462?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Grace Van Pelt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "132 episodes, 2008-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000677/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robin Tunney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1196946/characters/nm0000677?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Teresa Lisbon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "151 episodes, 2008-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1466859/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Owain Yeoman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1196946/characters/nm1466859?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wayne Rigsby"}, {"url": "#", "name": "132 episodes, 2008-2015"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["23 September 2008 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Mentalist"], "Filming Locations": ["Sacramento, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Primrose Hill Productions", "Warner Bros.

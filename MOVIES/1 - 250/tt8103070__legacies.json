You might as well deal with the pain once you finish TVD and TO and move on rather than cling to this last ounce of hope (haha). This show had so much more potential that was pretty much ignored. It adds in tons of mythical creatures which could've been interesting only they made it so immature. It's honestly as if the writer became a middle schooler over night. Another thing is the acting. I'm sorry but other than (Obviously Rick) Josie, Lizzie, Landon, and Hope (who can be a stretch most times) , the actors and actresses either have little talent or are not given the platform to properly present their talent. I think we all had high expectations to which few were met. I'm so disappointed to be saying this and truly wish it were different, but don't waste your time unless you have nothing else to do.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1546109209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI2MDQzOTUtYzA2Yy00OTg1LWEyMGEtN2I3ZWViNzAyOTBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI2MDQzOTUtYzA2Yy00OTg1LWEyMGEtN2I3ZWViNzAyOTBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "The show centers around Hope Mikaelson, the vampire-witch-werewolf hybrid daughter of Hayley Marshall-Kenner and Klaus Mikaelson, and her time at a school for the supernatural called The Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted.", "uploadDate": "2020-12-10T21:48:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5994559/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Danielle Rose Russell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm5994559?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hope Mikaelson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "45 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2859626/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kaylee Bryant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm2859626?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josie Saltzman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "43 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0205127/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Matthew Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm0205127?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alaric Saltzman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2819219/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Peyton 'Alex' Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm2819219?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rafael Waithe"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4667959/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Demetrius Bridges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm4667959?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dorian Williams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7263948/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aria Shahghasemi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm7263948?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Landon Kirby"}, {"url": "#", "name": "43 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7875835/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Quincy Fouse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm7875835?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Milton 'MG' Greasley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6874403/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jenny Boyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm6874403?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lizzie Saltzman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8969330/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Chris Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm8969330?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kaleb Hawkins"}, {"url": "#", "name": "34 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1344966/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ben Levin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8103070/characters/nm1344966?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jed"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["25 October 2018 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Legacies"], "Filming Locations": ["Atlanta, Georgia, USA"], "Production Co": ["My So-Called Company", "Alloy Entertainment", "CBS Television Studios"], "Runtime": ["45 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

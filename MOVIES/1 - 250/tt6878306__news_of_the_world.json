The story is beautiful with a beautiful emotional connection between the leads, also tackles many interesting topics, and it's well written but it has nothing new or unique to deliver, we've seen many similar stories before. Tom Hanks' performance is very good and seeing him in a western role is new and interesting. The cinematography is amazing with many great frames and sceneries of the wildernesses.

Five years after the end of the Civil War, Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Hanks), a widower and veteran of three wars, now moves from town to town as a non-fiction storyteller, sharing the news of presidents and queens, glorious feuds, devastating catastrophes, and gripping adventures from the far reaches of the globe.   In the plains of Texas, he crosses paths with Johanna (Helena Zengel, System Crasher), a 10-year-old taken in by the Kiowa people six years earlier and raised as one of their own. Johanna, hostile to a world she\u2019s never experienced, is being returned to her biological aunt and uncle against her will. \n\nKidd agrees to deliver the child where the law says she belongs. As they travel hundreds of miles into the unforgiving wilderness, the two will face tremendous challenges of both human and natural forces as they search for a place that either can call home.\n\nNews of the World is directed by Greengrass (the Bourne films, United 93) from his screenplay with Luke Davies (Lion), based on the National Book Award finalist and best-selling novel by Paulette Jiles. The film is produced by Gary Goetzman (Mamma Mia! franchise, Greyhound), Gail Mutrux (The Danish Girl, Donnie Brasco) and Gregory Goodman (22 July, 8 Mile). The executive producers are Steven Shareshian and Tore Schmidt. The film\u2019s music is by eight-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee James Newton Howard.", "uploadDate": "2020-10-22T15:32:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000158/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Hanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm0000158?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain Kidd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0040106/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tom Astor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm0040106?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cavalry Lieutenant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4277071/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Andy Kastelic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm4277071?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Union Duty Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001858/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mare Winningham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm0001858?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Doris Boudlin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3856319/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chris Bylsma"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm3856319?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Red River Heckler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7155000/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Darrin Giossi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm7155000?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Federal Soldier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0555500/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Elizabeth Marvel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm0555500?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mrs. Gannett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10436155/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Clay James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm10436155?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Almay's Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8023748/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Helena Zengel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm8023748?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Johanna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6068870/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Travis Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm6068870?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cavalry Rider"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0571964/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ray McKinnon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm0571964?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Simon Boudlin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0912118/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jeffrey Ware"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm0912118?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Red River Heckler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2097963/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Justin Tade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm2097963?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Red River Heckler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2833438/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brenden Wedner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm2833438?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Young Progressive Speaker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3511834/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Michael Angelo Covino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6878306/characters/nm3511834?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Almay"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "China"], "Language": ["English", "North American Indian", "German"], "Release Date": ["25 December 2020 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["News of the World"], "Filming Locations": ["Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$2,250,430,", "27 December 2020"], "Gross USA": ["$12,668,325"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$12,668,325"], "Production Co": ["Perfect World Pictures", "Playtone", "Pretty Pictures"], "Runtime": ["118 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.\n\nBut then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.\n\nThe protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!\n\nTheir story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.\n\nWhile their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.\n\nWithout spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.\n\nI would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent."}, "duration": "PT2H12M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1015463705", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWJjNWYzMzItYmEyNC00ODdmLWJmOGEtMWY0N2E2NGJlNTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWJjNWYzMzItYmEyNC00ODdmLWJmOGEtMWY0N2E2NGJlNTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "All unemployed, Ki-taek's family takes peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks for their livelihood until they get entangled in an unexpected incident.", "uploadDate": "2019-10-02T15:27:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0814280/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kang-ho Song"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm0814280?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ki Taek"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1856097/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Yeo-jeong Cho"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm1856097?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Yeon Kyo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6476224/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "So-dam Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm6476224?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ki Jung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4525883/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hye-jin Jang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm4525883?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chung Sook"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7616095/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ji-so Jung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm7616095?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Da Hye"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4522499/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Keun-rok Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm4522499?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Driver Yoon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11261148/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jae-myeong Jo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm11261148?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "CEO's Brother of Pizza Place"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11044243/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kyu-baek Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm11044243?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Drunk Person 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1310525/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sun-kyun Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm1310525?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dong Ik"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6079248/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Woo-sik Choi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm6079248?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ki Woo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7553003/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lee Jeong-eun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm7553003?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Moon Gwang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3745391/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Myeong-hoon Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm3745391?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Geun Se"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10700274/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hyun-jun Jung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm10700274?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Da Song"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10860732/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Esuz Jeong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm10860732?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "CEO of Pizza Place"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10215504/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ik-han Jung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6751668/characters/nm10215504?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Neighbor"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["South Korea"], "Language": ["Korean", "English"], "Release Date": ["8 November 2019 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Parasite"], "Filming Locations": ["Goyang Aqua Studio - 250 Tongil-ro 396beon-gil, Deogyang-gu, Goyang, South Korea"], "Budget": ["$11,400,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$393,216,", "13 October 2019"], "Gross USA": ["$53,369,749"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$258,854,666"], "Production Co": ["Barunson E&A", "CJ Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["132 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

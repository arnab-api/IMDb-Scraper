Some love the series and some could care less about it. Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. The titled animated family makes their home in Springfield, USA and gets into situations that are seemingly more outlandish and crazier than the previous adventure. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are still going strong after nearly a dozen years of television life and with each passing moment it seems that the series sets some new precedent. For several years the show seemed to be the only attraction to the then obscure Fox Network. It was the first primetime animated show that was treated like a sitcom since \"The Flintstones\" quietly left the air in 1966. Many people feared the series when it first premiered in 1989 because they felt that it was hardcore adult material in a candied form that would appeal to younger audiences. Well for the most part this was true. However, \"The Simpsons\" would prove to be much more for all audiences. The great thing about the series is that it caters to all audiences. True there are usually situations that may not be suitable for all viewers, but then again that is true with everything on television this side of Disney Land and Sesame Street. \"The Simpsons\" works because of great comedy of course, but also great lessons that can be taken from most of the episodes. The people within the program may be animated, but they are just as complicated and vulnerable as the people watching them. All the regulars have their quirks, but in some episodes you can understand what certain characters are going through because the show is so life-like at times. Former President George Bush (the one from 1988-1992) once made a statement that families should be more like \"The Waltons\" and less like \"The Simpsons\". His opinion is somewhat old-fashioned and unrealistic. In other words, many topics dealt with in \"The Simpsons\" fit life for people in the 1990s and 2000s better than \"The Waltons\" did in the 1970s. A crowning achievement in television art. 5 stars out of 5."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1389078297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2ZWU2N2UtZjMzMS00NWViLTgwZTQtYzQ2OTc1YzNjMzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE2ZWU2N2UtZjMzMS00NWViLTgwZTQtYzQ2OTc1YzNjMzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season", "uploadDate": "2013-01-11T06:35:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0144657/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dan Castellaneta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096697/characters/nm0144657?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Homer Simpson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "731 episodes, 1989-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0733427/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Harry Shearer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096697/characters/nm0733427?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ned Flanders"}, {"url": "#", "name": "731 episodes, 1989-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0810379/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Yeardley Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096697/characters/nm0810379?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lisa Simpson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "729 episodes, 1989-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0370788/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pamela Hayden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096697/characters/nm0370788?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Milhouse Van Houten"}, {"url": "#", "name": "652 episodes, 1989-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004813/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nancy Cartwright"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096697/characters/nm0004813?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bart Simpson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "731 episodes, 1989-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001413/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Julie Kavner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096697/characters/nm0001413?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Marge Simpson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "730 episodes, 1989-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000279/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hank Azaria"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096697/characters/nm0000279?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Moe Szyslak"}, {"url": "#", "name": "720 episodes, 1989-2022"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534134/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tress MacNeille"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096697/characters/nm0534134?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Agnes Skinner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "604 episodes, 1990-2022"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["Chinese", "English", "Spanish", "Albanian", "French", "Japanese", "German", "Russian", "Hindi", "Swahili", "Italian", "Swedish", "Turkish", "Cantonese", "Mandarin", "Hebrew", "Arabic", "Klingon", "Bengali", "Czech"], "Release Date": ["17 December 1989 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Simpsons"], "Filming Locations": ["Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$750,000", "(estimated)"], "Production Co": ["Gracie Films", "20th Century Fox Television", "Fox Television Animation"], "Runtime": ["22 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "(season 1-2)", "Dolby Digital", "(season 20-)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

Is it really worth it to watch One piece? YES! YES! YES! One piece is not too long, and you should really watch it! (I mean it has like almost 800 chapters in the Manga, but anyone that loves One piece will tell you that is not enough). Why is it so good? Because it is an awesome, well written and drawn Manga/Anime. Oda, the creator of One piece, is really one of my favorite people in all the world; I have nothing but respect to that man. \n\nThis anime is about a guy named Luffy who wants to become the Pirate King. He wants to follow the steps of Gol D. Roger, the only man who became the Pirate King, and he wants to discover Gol D. Roger's treasure (ONE PIECE) which is supposed to be the best of the best. That is the main idea of the whole series, a man and his crew sailing to get the treasure. I know it doesn't tell much, but I don't want to make this review that long, and I want you to watch it.\n\nYou must think I'm childish and immature for liking something like this, and in some way I am. I started watching it when I was in highschool. You have to like fantasy to enjoy it. I am in university right now, and I am more hooked with it than before. The first episodes and the first seasons will tell you nothing about One piece. It is funny, it has sad stories, it has some cool fights, but you probably will see no future in the anime. When you get to the episode 100th episode, you will know a little bit, like 5% of the whole story, when you get to 200th, like 10%. I'm right now in the 780 chapter and I still don't know so many things, and I am dying to know them all. This is the reason why I love it so much. This anime doesn't tell you the story right away. That is the beauty of this anime, that is the soul. Actually, it feels like when you are in love. Like you are dating this girl, a special one, and she makes you suffer and she makes you happy, and she takes you to a whole different world. \n\nThis anime takes its time so that you can get to know the main characters, thousands of secondary characters, thousands of stories and tales, the many fights, the islands, etc. That is when this anime becomes mature and not so childish, with its heartbreaking stories, inspiring speeches, amazing quotes. It has references of many things, like General Culture, actors, singers, famous people you know nowadays, and classic movies and books. Every story, every character, every island, every thing in One piece has a background. Oda wants to show everything little by little, his preparing you from the very start for the climax of its last episodes. Sometimes you will think some stories and characters are not necessary, but these stories drop you little clues about something that is going to happen. They get you thinking and talking about many crazy theories. You get to see the progress in Luffy's crew, and you cannot do anything but love them. You get to see really evil villains, yet you will also love them. I am not afraid to say that I have cry like a little baby with this anime.\n\nI am fan of many other anime, like Dragon Ball, Bleach, Naruto, Death Note, Code Geass, Darker than black, Evangelion, Hellsing, Monster, and so on, yet I will tell you my favorite is this one. I give One piece a 10/10, not only because I personally love it. Also because I think One piece should be recognized. For its artwork, for its originality. Even though it has some things from Dragon Ball, and from other Mangas, it doesn't exist a pirate story like this one. It always has something to offer. If you are a fan, and you are following the Manga and Anime like I am, I know you trust in Oda, you know he will never get you disappointed, and I know I will never stop watching it. \n\n(Sorry for my English, I hope I was able to express myself)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "One Piece: 3D, 2Y", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1913960985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmIyMTVhNzItYjA5MS00MmE5LWFjNzctOTdlYTAzY2NkOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmIyMTVhNzItYjA5MS00MmE5LWFjNzctOTdlYTAzY2NkOWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-01-12T17:12:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0849028/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mayumi Tanaka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0388629/characters/nm0849028?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Monkey D.

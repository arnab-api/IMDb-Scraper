Based off the trailer, going into this movie I was expecting the classic franchise based off of the Hilicker family, you know, the deformed freaks roaming the forest and trapping people for food and torture, however, this movie wasn't that at all. Wrong Turn 2021 took a new spin on things and although it was relatively interesting, there was no connection to any of the other movies. It was almost as if this was a completely different horror film simply titled Wrong Turn. There were few, if any, scary parts to the movie and most of the \"horror\" was just action and anticipation for what's to come next. Mimicking the original Wrong Turn franchise, the kills were great, gory, and brutal as can be. Although this movie was very fast paced and tense for a majority of it, it wasn't near as good as the originals and told a completely different story based on a different \"family\" with completely different characters. If you're going in to this movie hoping to see a return of the Hikickers or their offspring, I hate to break it to you, but this movie it not that.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2786115865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2U1MTVjYWEtOWY2MS00ZjJkLWEzYTMtY2Y0ZjE5ZTI4YWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2U1MTVjYWEtOWY2MS00ZjJkLWEzYTMtY2Y0ZjE5ZTI4YWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Backwoods terror and never-jangling suspense meet when Jen (Charlotte Vega) and a group of friends set out to hike the Appalachian Trail.

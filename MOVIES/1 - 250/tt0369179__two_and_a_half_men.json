This show should have been cancelled & the remaining characters re- written into a new show focusing on Cryer being the main character,after 8 seasons i think he should have been given the chance more so than hiring a new actor to take over the staring role,both Jon Cryer & Charlie Sheen can raise a laugh with a simple facial expression a talent that sadly Ashton Kutcher does not seem to possess,Kutcher is a good actor thats obvious but he's the wrong choice for this show. the first episode was just embarrassing but the second was so bereft of comedy the writers should sit down and watch an episode of big bang & 2 broke girls to see how it should be done. Love him or hate him Charlie Sheen was the real reason for the success of this show & he will be sorely missed."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Two And A Half Men: Of Course He's Dead", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3151281433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMyNTZhYjYtNmVlYy00Zjg4LWJhZmMtZjcxYzZhZDE1YWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMyNTZhYjYtNmVlYy00Zjg4LWJhZmMtZjcxYzZhZDE1YWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two And A Half Men: Of Course He's Dead", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T09:42:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001083/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jon Cryer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0369179/characters/nm0001083?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alan Harper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "262 episodes, 2003-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004916/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Conchata Ferrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0369179/characters/nm0004916?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Berta"}, {"url": "#", "name": "211 episodes, 2003-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0427489/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Angus T.

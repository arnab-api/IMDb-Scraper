Sure, it's a book adaptation which already sounds like a red flag because many of them aren't as good as the source material, however Cherry can be called an exception to an extent. The film definitely boasts a beautiful style in camera work and craft because of how smart these techniques are used. The Russos definitely make their mark and do it ever so boldly. The real issue with Cherry however is the way it explains itself. The pacing and tonality tends to be misguided by an almost TOO formulaic approach, however doesn't make for a bad viewing experience either thanks to Holland's gut-wrenching performance as Nico Walker. Holland loses himself in the role so masterfully, I nearly forgot that this was the same actor that helmed the Spider-Man throne. I'd never felt more sorrow for a character since John Coffey in The Green Mile. Ciara Bravo also steals the spotlight constantly with her transitional performance that quite honestly surprised me. Onscreen together, both Holland and Bravo, is nothing short of perfect chemistry. Even if the writing gets cheesy sometimes, it's a relieving cheesy rather than a revolting type. This film did away with itself and it shows.\n\nVerdict: Cherry is a solid attempt at something different for the Russos and a great excuse to give Holland and Bravo a good taste of grueling acting. The film may not have been what we wanted it to be, but I feel that it still has something good, if not special, to offer.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H22M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Watch Now on Apple TV+", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2259206169", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2RlNjdlZGItZTIyNy00MGU4LWFkNTctMjFkODQ0MjFlNWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2RlNjdlZGItZTIyNy00MGU4LWFkNTctMjFkODQ0MjFlNWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "'Cherry' follows the wild journey of a disenfranchised young man from Ohio who meets the love of his life, only to risk losing her through a series of bad decisions and challenging life circumstances.", "uploadDate": "2021-03-09T20:59:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4043618/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Holland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9130508/characters/nm4043618?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cherry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2930503/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jack Reynor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9130508/characters/nm2930503?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Pills & Coke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5302788/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jeff Wahlberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9130508/characters/nm5302788?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jimenez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6408859/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Gandolfini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9130508/characters/nm6408859?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cousin Joe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4940132/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Daniel R.

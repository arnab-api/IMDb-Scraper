The casting was great with decent performances, especially Oldman and Lilly who shined, and the (based on true events) story is certainly not your typical fare. I'm glad it wasn't \"Hollywood-ish\".\n\nYoung newb filmmaker Nicholas Jarecki produced, directed, wrote and cast himself in this interesting story that lacked the thrills one would expect from a drama \"thriller\". The intertwining stories had some plot and technical issues and could've been told with better continuity. But they did flow rather well.\n\nHis directing was good, but the somewhat slow pacing for the 118 min runtime felt dragged out. Some acts should've been paced faster, and some scenes either cut down or out. And he certainly could've directed some of his cast better. The score was good, but could've used a little more up-beat \"thrilling\" tones. But for a young newb filmmaker wearing that many hats, he did good.\n\nThe fact this was based on true events added shock value for the lack of great thrills, and thus made for a good watch. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I watch it again? Probably not. It's a solid 7/10 from me.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4066885913", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ5MmM1ZjYtOWVkZC00NjdiLWE0MWQtNmI0YTZlMWJkOTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ5MmM1ZjYtOWVkZC00NjdiLWE0MWQtNmI0YTZlMWJkOTZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A drug trafficker arranges a multi-cartel Fentanyl smuggling operation.

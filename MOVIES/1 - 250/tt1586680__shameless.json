Its a straight transition of the script with some adjustments.\n\nHowever having seen shows that were changed beyond all recognition I can say that is a good thing.\n\nThe cast are excellent in their roles and the story which is far from the usual tame fodder of American drama is handled with honesty and realism. The characters mostly have their own interests to consider as well as the kids trying to keep their family together. \n\nWilliam H Macy is ideal in a role which doesn't allow him much initial screen time but I'm sure future episodes will focus on him since Frank is such a fascinating character.

Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3115057433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhlM2UyYTEtOThkZS00MTAyLWFlOGQtNzIwNTc5ZmVkOWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhlM2UyYTEtOThkZS00MTAyLWFlOGQtNzIwNTc5ZmVkOWQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:24:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001321/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0001321?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Albus Dumbledore"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001059/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robbie Coltrane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0001059?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hagrid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0705356/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Daniel Radcliffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0705356?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Harry Potter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0577982/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Harry Melling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0577982?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dudley Dursley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212600/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Derek Deadman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0212600?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bartender in Leaky Cauldron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1089198/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ben Borowiecki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm1089198?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Diagon Alley Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0873942/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Verne Troyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0873942?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Griphook"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0107101/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Richard Bremmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0107101?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "He Who Must Not Be Named"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001749/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maggie Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0001749?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Professor McGonagall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1196732/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Saunders Triplets"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm1196732?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Baby Harry Potter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0789716/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fiona Shaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0789716?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aunt Petunia Dursley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0341743/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Richard Griffiths"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0341743?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Uncle Vernon Dursley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001324/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ian Hart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0001324?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Professor Quirrell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001116/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Warwick Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0001116?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Goblin Bank Teller"}, {"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0001116?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Professor Flitwick"}, {"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0001116?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Voice of Griphook"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000457/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0241527/characters/nm0000457?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mr. Ollivander"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK", "USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["16 November 2001 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"], "Filming Locations": ["Leavesden Studios, Leavesden, Hertfordshire, England, UK"], "Budget": ["$125,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$90,294,621,", "18 November 2001"], "Gross USA": ["$318,087,620"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$1,006,968,171"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Heyday Films", "1492 Pictures"], "Runtime": ["152 min", "159 min", "(extended)"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS-ES", "Dolby Digital EX", "SDDS", "(8 channels)", "12-Track Digital Sound", "IMAX 6-Track", "DTS", "(DTS: X)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

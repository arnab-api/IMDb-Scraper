Which is a crying shame, because for any one who loves good action shows, Banshee is a must watch. There's a reason, despite being on a premium channel not many people watch, that Banshee has lasted this long. And that reason is sheer awesome badassery. \n\nFirst off, being a premium show (and a Cinemax one at that), Banshee is chock full of gratuitous nudity and sex (which, not to sound dirty, is of pretty high quality). And there is typically at least one crazy violent scene per episode. So if neither of those are your cup of tea, maybe you should skip this show. But if you like or don't mind either of those things, you'll find amazing gun-battles, even more amazing hand-to-hand fight scenes, and some cool, gritty characters.\n\nThe plot is a tough pill to swallow early on in the first season--a hotshot thief just happens to get the opportunity to masquerade as a small town sheriff in Amish country--and you pretty much have to resign yourself to the fact that nearly every female character on the show will sleep with the protagonist at one point or another at the point of bordering on the absurd. But after the first few episodes and the benefit of suspension of disbelief, the show becomes incredibly addictive, and you end up really caring about these characters. Stand outs include the mysterious protagonist; Kai, the Amish crime boss; the criminally underused deputies who both aid and are suspicious of the protagonist; and Job, our hero's cross- dressing confidant. \n\nWhat makes Banshee stand out are the little things--the subtle changes to the opening credits in each episode. The epilogue scenes of each episode. The incredibly well-choreographed hand- to-hand fight scenes. The foreshadowing of developments to come. \n\nIf you're a fan of shows like Justified, and True Blood, and Sons of Anarchy, then you'll love Banshee. Cinemax is well worth the subscription just to watch this show (plus you get other awesome shows like Strike Back and The Knick, but that's beyond the scope of this interview). Do yourself a favor and start watching this show immediately.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 4 Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1681503513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDEzNjIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5NTQxODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDEzNjIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5NTQxODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Second season 4 trailer for Banshee on Cinemax.", "uploadDate": "2016-02-26T10:54:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1102278/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Antony Starr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm1102278?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lucas Hood"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0860947/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ulrich Thomsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm0860947?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kai Proctor"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785854/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Matt Servitto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm0785854?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Deputy Brock Lotus"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1801419/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ryann Shane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm1801419?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Deva Hopewell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1013218/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matthew Rauch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm1013218?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Clay Burton"}, {"url": "#", "name": "33 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242654/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Trieste Kelly Dunn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm0242654?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Deputy Siobhan Kelly"}, {"url": "#", "name": "34 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002027/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ben Cross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm0002027?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mr. Rabbit"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2013-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0587431/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ivana Milicevic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm0587431?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carrie Hopewell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0265670/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frankie Faison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm0265670?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sugar Bates"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1229640/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hoon Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm1229640?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Job"}, {"url": "#", "name": "37 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3827455/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lili Simmons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm3827455?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rebecca Bowman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0085952/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rus Blackwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm0085952?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gordon Hopewell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2009006/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Demetrius Grosse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm2009006?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Deputy Emmett Yawners"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0749570/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Anthony Ruivivar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2017109/characters/nm0749570?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alex Longshadow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "18 episodes, 2013-2015"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["11 January 2013 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Banshee"], "Filming Locations": ["Charlotte, North Carolina, USA"], "Production Co": ["Your Face Goes Here Entertainment", "Cinemax"], "Runtime": ["60 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

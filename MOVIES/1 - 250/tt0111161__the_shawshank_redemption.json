It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.\n\nOther than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". \n\nThe directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. \n\nWhatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H22M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3877612057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ2NDA3MDcxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE5NTU0NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ2NDA3MDcxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE5NTU0NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.", "uploadDate": "2014-03-05T14:13:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000209/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tim Robbins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0000209?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Andy Dufresne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0348409/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bob Gunton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0348409?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Warden Norton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000317/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Clancy Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0000317?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Captain Hadley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001679/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mark Rolston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0001679?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bogs Diamond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0218810/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jeffrey DeMunn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0218810?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "1946 D.A."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0321358/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Neil Giuntoli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0321358?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jigger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0698998/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Proval"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0698998?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Snooze"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0161980/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jude Ciccolella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0161980?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Guard Mert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000151/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Morgan Freeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0000151?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006669/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "William Sadler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0006669?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Heywood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004743/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Gil Bellows"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0004743?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0926235/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James Whitmore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0926235?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Brooks Hatlen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0104594/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Larry Brandenburg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0104594?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Skeet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0508742/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brian Libby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0508742?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Floyd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0706554/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Joseph Ragno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111161/characters/nm0706554?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ernie"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["14 October 1994 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"], "Filming Locations": ["Sandy Point, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands"], "Budget": ["$25,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$727,327,", "25 September 1994"], "Gross USA": ["$28,699,976"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$28,817,291"], "Production Co": ["Castle Rock Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["142 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

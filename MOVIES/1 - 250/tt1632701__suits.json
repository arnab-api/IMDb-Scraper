The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately. \n\nSUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact. \n\nThe dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclich\u00e9d, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit! \n\nGrady Harp", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "TCA Reel", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1035774745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxODI2NzY3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg3Nzk5MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxODI2NzY3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg3Nzk5MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the latest teaser from the new season of \"Suits\"!", "uploadDate": "2014-01-19T10:23:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532683/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gabriel Macht"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632701/characters/nm0532683?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harvey Specter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "134 episodes, 2011-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1423048/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sarah Rafferty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632701/characters/nm1423048?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Donna Paulsen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "134 episodes, 2011-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1620783/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Meghan Markle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632701/characters/nm1620783?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rachel Zane"}, {"url": "#", "name": "108 episodes, 2011-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0389069/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rick Hoffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632701/characters/nm0389069?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Louis Litt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "134 episodes, 2011-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1140666/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Patrick J.

K is a Blade Runner, a policeman who tracks down and terminates replicants (androids) whose model are viewed dangerous to society. K is himself a replicant, but has been programmed to be beneficial to society. One day he tracks down and terminates a replicant that has managed to evade detection and capture for over 28 years. In his garden are found the remains of a female replicant. Shockingly, the woman died during childbirth and the baby appears to have survived. Replicants cannot reproduce. If word gets out that they can, the human-replicant hierarchy will forever be disturbed. K must find the child, quickly. Also after it is Niander Wallace, a billionaire whose company makes replicants and whose main interest is in changing the world order.\n\nAn intriguing and engaging movie, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies, Sicario, Arrival) and co-written by Hampton Francher, who co-wrote the screenplay for the original Blade Runner. Good plot with some great twists and turns. Some clever manipulation of the viewer too, as you are funneled down one way of thinking, only to have things turn out in another direction. This unpredictability, and requirement that you use your brain, makes for some intriguing viewing.\n\nGreat special effects, without being too show-offy and gratuitous. Great action scenes too.\n\nWhile I have seen the original Blade Runner (in all three forms), you don't have to have seen it in order to enjoy, or even understand, this one. It works fine as a standalone movie.\n\nSolid performances by all involved.\n\nOn the negative side, the plot is not entirely water-tight. There are a few key moments where things take a turn for the implausible and contrived. The end result ultimately justified these turns, making me less critical of them, but the writers could easily have developed the plot around those moments more, in order to make them less loose and clumsy.\n\nThough I thought it was going to be, the running time of 163 minutes is not an issue. The movie never drags and the time just flies by. \n\nGreat movie - certainly not your average sequel.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "At Cinemas Now", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3362371865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.", "uploadDate": "2017-10-04T10:07:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331516/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Gosling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm0331516?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "'K'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000705/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robin Wright"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm0000705?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lieutenant Joshi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1315976/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Vilma Sz\u00e9csi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm1315976?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Angry Old Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0365445/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Wood Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm0365445?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nandez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1319365/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "T\u00f3mas Lemarquis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm1319365?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "File Clerk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001579/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Edward James Olmos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm0001579?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gaff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1760156/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sallie Harmsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm1760156?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Female Replicant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4496875/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mackenzie Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm4496875?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mariette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1176985/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dave Bautista"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm1176985?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sapper Morton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0036553/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mark Arnold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm0036553?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Interviewer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1869101/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ana de Armas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm1869101?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2810287/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Dastmalchian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm2810287?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Coco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1679778/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sylvia Hoeks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm1679778?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Luv"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001467/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jared Leto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm0001467?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Niander Wallace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007814/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hiam Abbass"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1856101/characters/nm0007814?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Freysa"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "UK", "Canada", "Hungary", "Spain", "Mexico"], "Language": ["English", "Finnish", "Japanese", "Hungarian", "Russian", "Somali", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["6 October 2017 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Acid Zoo"], "Filming Locations": ["Korda Studios, Etyek, Hungary"], "Budget": ["$150,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$32,753,122,", "8 October 2017"], "Gross USA": ["$92,054,159"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$259,334,548"], "Production Co": ["Alcon Entertainment", "Columbia Pictures", "Sony"], "Runtime": ["164 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Atmos", "Auro 11.1", "DTS", "(DTS: X)", "IMAX 6-Track", "12-Track Digital Sound", "(IMAX 12 track)", "Dolby Surround 7.1", "Sonics-DDP", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

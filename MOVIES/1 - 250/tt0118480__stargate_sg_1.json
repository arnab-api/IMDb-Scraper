With memorable episodes sometimes poignant and heart rending like season ones 'Singularity' and season six's 'Meridian' and the hail to the real heroes of the military 'Heroes parts 1 & 2',to the hilarious laugh your ass off episodes like @urgo' and the classic and fans favourite groundhog day episode 'Window of opportunity'. Special fx and great stunt work provide some great action episodes like 'Full Circle', 'Heroes 1&2' and 'The Lost City' Stargate keeps producing. There are numerous fans of every genre it represents whether it be the science, the characters, the adventure, the romance or lack between every type esquire relationship, shippers can imagine.\n\nStargate SG-1 also has one of the biggest fanfiction bases, with quality writing of every genre produced by numerous writers willing to write about their favourite show and put it out there on the net for people to see.\n\nAnd now with a widening franchise, from books about the shows best scripts to extended universe and SG Atlantis, it shows it has the staying power that another popular Sci-fi series once did, Star Trek.\n\nIf you've never seen it, give it a try, either from the first season or the current eight. Stargate has something which appeals to everyone, whether it be humour, action, or the fact that the characters are so likable and more so drop dead drooling gorgeous. And if that doesn't impress you, take a look at the great amount of stars wanting to be on the show, it's an impressive list."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Stargate SG-1: The Complete Tenth Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi444989721", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzczMjM1M2MtNzFjZi00ZWYwLTlkNzAtOGQwN2E2MzdhMDg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzczMjM1M2MtNzFjZi00ZWYwLTlkNzAtOGQwN2E2MzdhMDg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:59:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0850102/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Amanda Tapping"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118480/characters/nm0850102?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Major Samantha Carter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "213 episodes, 1997-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0788218/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Shanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118480/characters/nm0788218?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Daniel Jackson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "197 episodes, 1997-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0204493/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Don S.

As one who works on Wall Street, I can tell you that people like George actually do exist (promoted to a position of authority due to nepotism, but set up for a fall because he actually has ethics). I thought the way they set things up with the phone call by Reba, the pragmatic selfishness of his current girlfriend, and the non-date date worked well together and was plausible enough within context to be enjoyable. I also thought the relationship between jock-player (Wilson) and over-the-hill jock Witherspoon was sweet and funny in its own way.\n\nHowever, Kathryn Hahn steals every scene she's in as Rudd's personal assistant who hates what's going on and is also a single mom-to-be. And her scene in the hospital alone was worth the price of admission to me. The ending was also well handled. This is the best Paul Rudd performance I have seen since The Shape of Things after many bad ones in-between. Witherspoon was fine even though she didn't seem to have sizzling chemistry with Rudd - she was wonderful with Wilson. The cameo by Shalhoub as a psychiatrist was hilarious. And Mark-Linn Baker was appropriately cowering as the corporate lawyer. Nicholson was fine - he felt the part even though he could have played it in his sleep. Not one of his best, but more than adequate.\n\nSo, is this an original and ground-breaking film? No. Is it a highly enjoyable romantic comedy with good supporting performances and funny scenes? Yes!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "How Do You Know", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3436250649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMzNDQ1MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY4NDcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMzNDQ1MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY4NDcyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Feeling a bit past her prime at 27, former athlete Lisa Jorgenson (Witherspoon) finds herself in the middle of a love triangle, as a corporate guy in crisis (Rudd) competes with Lisa's current, baseball-playing beau (Wilson).", "uploadDate": "2010-08-14T08:59:35Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000702/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Reese Witherspoon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0000702?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lisa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005562/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Owen Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0005562?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1063517/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kathryn Hahn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm1063517?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Annie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0893120/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lenny Venito"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0893120?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Al"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0572261/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ron McLarty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0572261?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "George's Lawyer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0518511/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Domenick Lombardozzi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0518511?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bullpen Pitcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3500582/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Teyonah Parris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm3500582?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Riva"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0606487/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dean Norris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0606487?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Softball Coach"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0748620/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Paul Rudd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0748620?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "George"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000197/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jack Nicholson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0000197?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Charles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0513021/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mark Linn-Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0513021?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0697062/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Molly Price"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0697062?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Coach Sally"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0174909/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shelley Conn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0174909?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Terry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0868110/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Tormey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0868110?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Doorman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001724/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tony Shalhoub"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1341188/characters/nm0001724?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Psychiatrist"}]}]}

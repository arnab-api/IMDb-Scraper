Night Shyamalan lately? I used to like him in earlier films like Unbreakable and Signs, but he hasn't made the critics and audiences gifted as it would probably if his directing career is in serious jeopardy. One of the biggest and toughest question is that simple: Why is M. Night Shyamalan directing in a new post-apocalyptic adventure starring Will and Jaden Smith? Did he ever asked to direct After Earth or did Sony wanted to choose any director that Smith had previously worked for instead of Shyamalan? For those who don't know, this is the first lowest-rated movie for Will Smith since 1999's disappointing mess \"Wild Wild West,\" one for Jaden since \"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\" and another bomb for Shyamalan.\n\nAfter Earth feels like a re-cut of \"Battlefield Earth\" (Ya know, the Travolta movie we don't even care anymore) and sometimes half-\"I Am Legend\" and half-\"Hunger Games.\" But to me, maybe it's the whole Scientology thing that starts to ruin the whole story.\n\nThe story is ridiculous, poorly acted (Smith sounded like James Earl Jones), mediocre sci-fi elements. How can this movie be much worse? I wished the late Roger Ebert was here giving a harsh review on \"After Earth.\" Bottom Line: It's not going to be a big summer success, but it's another letdown for fans of Will Smith. I'll just pass on the movie instead of renting it on DVD.\n\n** 1/2 out of 5 stars", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2277418521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMjY3OTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzkyNzQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMjY3OTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzkyNzQyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After Earth After a crash landing, a father and son explore a planet that was evacuated by humans 1,000 years earlier.", "uploadDate": "2013-03-09T10:57:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1535523/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jaden Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1815862/characters/nm1535523?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kitai Raige"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0645683/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sophie Okonedo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1815862/characters/nm0645683?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Faia Raige"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0607703/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Glenn Morshower"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1815862/characters/nm0607703?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Commander Velan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0223527/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sacha Dhawan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1815862/characters/nm0223527?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hesper Pilot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1459109/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Diego Klattenhoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1815862/characters/nm1459109?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Veteran Ranger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2089884/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lincoln Lewis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1815862/characters/nm2089884?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Running Cadet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5685820/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sincere L.

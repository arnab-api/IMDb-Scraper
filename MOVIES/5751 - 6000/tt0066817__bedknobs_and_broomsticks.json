Although it was already an \"old\" movie by the time I was able to watch it, Bedknobs and Broomsticks completely enchanted me. People here who say that the movie would not hold the attention of a young child are mistaken. I must have watched this movie dozens of times between the ages of 1 and 10 and every time I watched it all the way though, intensely engrossed through every scene. There are a handful of movies that hold very fond places in my childhood memories, this is one of them. It is a wonderful movie, and even now I still find the story charming. Angela Lansbury stars as Miss Price, a widow who is studying witchcraft through a correspondence course during World War II. She grumpily agrees to let three children board at her home in the country to keep them safe from the air raids going on in London. After the three children discover that Miss Price is an apprentice witch, they are swept up into a magical adventure on a traveling bed along with Miss Price and Professor Brown, the headmaster of the College of Witchcraft. The thing I like best about this movie, is that the magic never stops as the children along with the two adults journey to London, the Island of Naboomboo, Naboomboo Lagoon and Portabello Road. The children are treated to a marvelous adventure, flying through the skies on a bed, swimming underwater in a tropical lagoon, watching a football game played by animals and finally helping out in the war when Miss Price enchants a museum full of ancient suits of armor with the magic words, \"Traguna, Macoities, Tracorum Satis De.\" The songs in the movie may be your typical musical-stock, but I challenge anyone to not tap their toes during \"Portabello Road\", or to not get \"Englentine\" stuck in their head. They just add another element of fun and enjoyment to an already delightful movie. The movie is well worth watching, and suitable for any child. Even today's children will find delight in the cartoon/human relations and the spectacular ending sequence were empty suits of armor are brought to life to fight for the good guys. I consider this movie a timeless classic that shouldn't be passed up."}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2338504217", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZiYTk0MzQtY2NjYy00MGE0LTkwYTUtNzBmOGYzYWU2MDU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZiYTk0MzQtY2NjYy00MGE0LTkwYTUtNzBmOGYzYWU2MDU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An apprentice witch, three kids and a cynical magician conman search for the missing component to a magic spell to be used in the defense of Britain in World War II.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-30T09:56:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001450/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Angela Lansbury"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066817/characters/nm0001450?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Miss Price"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001522/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Roddy McDowall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066817/characters/nm0001522?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mr. Jelk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0259152/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Ericson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066817/characters/nm0259152?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Col.

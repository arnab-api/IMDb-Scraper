I was just hoping they didn't ruin the book. I know films can't be like the books, so I carefully did not re-read it.\n\nThey did an awesome job with the film. They captured the story, the flavor, the essence of the book, even if they did have to leave some things out. I loved the girls playing Alba.\n\nThere was laughing at the funny parts and some crying at the sad. My sister loved it. She had no intentions of reading it and only went because I had tickets. She was sniffly when we left and now has the book.\n\nNotice to guys who like blow em ups. This is a romantic chick flick! Though the one guy I had talked to in line was crying as we left. He did say he loved it.\n\nI would have given it a nine if some of the scenes hadn't been filmed in the dark like a lot of Hollywood.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Time Traveler's Wife", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2784428569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ3NTQzNTg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMyNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ3NTQzNTg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMyNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Time Traveler's Wife Theatrical Trailer", "uploadDate": "2009-06-16T14:20:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0634409/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michelle Nolden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0634409?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Annette DeTamble"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397124/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Arliss Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0397124?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Richard DeTamble"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0873860/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Katherine Trowell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0873860?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hospital Receptionist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0432422/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Esther Jun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0432422?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1139283/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Craig Snoyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm1139283?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chicago Police #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0834065/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carly Street"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0834065?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Librarian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1628077/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Brooklynn Proulx"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm1628077?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Clare at Six and Eight"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0515296/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ron Livingston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0515296?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gomez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1821102/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alex Ferris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm1821102?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Henry at Six"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0051509/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Eric Bana"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0051509?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Henry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0066025/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bart Bedford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0066025?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Library Researcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0083641/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Matt Birman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm0083641?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Chicago Police #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1046097/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rachel McAdams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm1046097?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Clare"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3550985/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Romyen Tangsubutra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm3550985?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Thai Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1067592/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jane McLean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452694/characters/nm1067592?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Charisse"}]}]}

My son suffered from this disease. I cannot tell you how frustrating it was to get a 21 year plus old person to get treatment. You can not force anyone of that age. He is now free of dilusions and watched with me. He said was not really what he saw (sees) but was \"sort of\" his experiences.\n\nMy 9 year old grandson really enjoyed the movie. As all young people do these days, he immediately googled the disease after the movie finished. He does not know about his uncle as with medication his uncle is one of the smartest and most normal in the family.\n\nThe story itself became a \"love story\". Made the heart warm. Very well acted. And even a sort of horror story with the visual effects. Something for everyone.\n\nWe watch many films. My pick so far for Best Movie of 2020.\n\nThis disease should be treated free for all those less fortunate who end up homeless as a result, or worse.. in prison. The world would be a better place. If that was the intent of the movie (understanding) then the goal was achieved. Plus true enjoyment of a first rate film with good acting on a low budget.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Watch Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3428105753", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A teenager coping with paranoid schizophrenia hopes his new experimental drug treatment will help him navigate high school and the outside world.", "uploadDate": "2020-08-11T21:41:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4055138/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlie Plummer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm4055138?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Adam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5347988/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Taylor Russell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm5347988?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Maya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0335275/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Beth Grant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm0335275?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sister Catherine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0780957/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lobo Sebastian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm0780957?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bodyguard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324658/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Walton Goggins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm0324658?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8883627/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Reinaldo Faberlle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm8883627?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Manuel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7084316/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Iain Tucker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm7084316?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ahole Teenager"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5902264/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Drew Scheid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm5902264?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ted"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000412/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Andy Garcia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm0000412?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Father Patrick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1455681/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "AnnaSophia Robb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm1455681?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rebecca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1256602/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Devon Bostick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm1256602?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joaquin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0662504/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Molly Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm0662504?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Beth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6734881/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Aaron Dominguez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm6734881?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Todd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1556377/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jeris Donovan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm1556377?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6881239/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sean Michael Weber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8045906/characters/nm6881239?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Paramedic"}]}]}

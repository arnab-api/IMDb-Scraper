Superman rids planet Earth of all the nuclear weapons, and in doing so unknowingly creates a super villain named Nuclear Man thanks to arch rival Lex Luthor.\n\nThe movie does star all the original cast, which surprised me. I knew Christopher Reeve was in it... and after reading his autobiography now know why. He said in the book that he only made it because the film studio wanted to make it and they said to him that they would only finance another movie he wanted to make if he made Superman IV. I will quote what he said in his book... \"The less said about Superman IV the better.\"\n\nGene Hackman returns as Lex Luthor & Margot Kidder is back as Lois Lane. They all did good jobs as always, although Margot was a bit unsure in places. The other supporting cast were not great. Mariel Hemingway played the new boss of the Daily Planet. She was awful... not a great actress in this I'm afraid. But she was not the worst. Mark Pillow played Nuclear Man. Absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely the worst of the whole quadrilogy.\n\nThe effects in this film were so bad. You could see that the budget of this film was so much less than the other 3 movies made. Superman flying was so bad that Flash Gordon was more convincing... and speaking of Flash Gordon... Nuclear Man looked like him... but more camp! Nuclear Mans outfit was embarrassing... it was not much of a super villains outfit. It honestly was just a bad character through and through.\n\nThere are also some really bad scenes... there was a scene where a large chuck of the Great Wall of China gets destroyed and Superman fixes it just by looking at it and using some dodgy blue eye lasers. What the hell? Terrible. Also, there is a scene where Nuclear Man kidnaps a Lacy and takes her into space... WHAT? He drags her to space and not only does she not scream or even say anything, but she can breathe fine in space... erm... really? I know Superman was never meant to be realistic, but that is too much!\n\nWhen I was a kid I was a big fan of the Superman movies... but I think my parents protected me from this disappointment, because I don't remember this film at all... I didn't see this film until I was an adult. Haha. Thanks Mum.\n\nI will give this film 5 out of 10.\n\nIt's a shame about this film... it was a very disappointing ending to Christopher Reeves Superman career. But no matter what he will always be a legend.\n\nFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Superman IV: The Quest for Peace", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3337990681", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjdlZmI4OWYtNDlmNC00NTMxLTg3NDEtMmNlZTY2YjcxZDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjdlZmI4OWYtNDlmNC00NTMxLTg3NDEtMmNlZTY2YjcxZDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace", "uploadDate": "2015-11-20T07:58:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001659/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Christopher Reeve"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0001659?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Superman"}, {"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0001659?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clark Kent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0178114/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jackie Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0178114?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Perry White"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001083/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jon Cryer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0001083?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0683565/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mark Pillow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0683565?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nuclear Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0452288/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Margot Kidder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0452288?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lois Lane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0393853/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "William Hootkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0393853?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Harry Howler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0495818/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Stanley Lebor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0495818?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "General Romoff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0064235/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Beatty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0064235?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "U.S. President"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000432/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gene Hackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0000432?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lex Luthor"}, {"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0000432?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nuclear Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0566013/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Marc McClure"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0566013?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jimmy Olsen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910737/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sam Wanamaker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0910737?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Warfield"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000446/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mariel Hemingway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0000446?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lacy Warfield"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0572468/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Damian McLawhorn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0572468?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jeremy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000980/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jim Broadbent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0000980?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jean Pierre Dubois"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0271514/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Don Fellows"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094074/characters/nm0271514?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Levon Hornsby"}]}]}

Produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, 'Bachelorette' is much blacker and isn't afraid to offend by portraying openly messed-up female characters as the leads and inserting them in familiar comic scenarios. \n\nThe premise involves four high school friends Regan (Kirsten Dunst), Becky (the brilliant Australian actress Rebel Wilson), Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher). The four girls \u2013 who were collectively known as the B \u2013Faces as school \u2013 reunite for Becky's wedding. Despite the happy facade, they're a fractured group.\n\nRegan is a cruel, controlling woman who's secretly upset that Becky got married before her; Gena uses sex to cover her problems, even explaining detailed sex acts to strangers and Katie \u2013 despite her outward craziness and love of partying - has elements of depression. Even Becky, who seems to be the most normal of the girls, is still dealing with the fallout of being teased at high school.\n\nWhile the plot has been done a million times (and is similar to the Hangover movies), it's the coarseness of the characters which make this movie stand out. The girls are meant to be unlikeable and there's plenty of coarse language to illustrate that point. While the plot plays out conventionally, it doesn't drown in a sea of third act sentimentality for the sake of neatly wrapping up the loose ends. While things improve for the girls as the movie progresses, they're still the same mean girls they were at the start. It's also refreshing to see a movie with strong female characters. Probably the stand out is Rebel Wilson, having graduated from Australian sketch comedy shows to establish herself as the next great comedic actress.\n\nIf you're after a slightly darker take of the rom-com formula, 'Bachelorette' is worth a look.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi176923929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODczMzQyNTQwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjUwNzYxOA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODczMzQyNTQwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjUwNzYxOA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Three friends are asked to be bridesmaids at a wedding of a woman they used to ridicule back in high school.", "uploadDate": "2012-07-25T09:41:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000379/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kirsten Dunst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm0000379?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Regan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0135221/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lizzy Caplan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm0135221?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0279545/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Isla Fisher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm0279545?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Katie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2601642/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Anna Rose Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm2601642?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Club Monaco Customer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0764445/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Horatio Sanz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm0764445?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Barely Attractive Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1531180/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kyle Bornheimer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm1531180?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Joe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235652/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ann Dowd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm0235652?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Victoria"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2124927/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ella Rae Peck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm2124927?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stefanie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2313103/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rebel Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm2313103?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Becky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4686350/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Paul Corning"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm4686350?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jack Johnson Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0710330/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Andrew Rannells"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm0710330?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Manny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1682390/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sue Jean Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm1682390?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wedding Planner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1887429/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hayes MacArthur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm1887429?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005188/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "James Marsden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm0005188?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Trevor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004395/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Adam Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1920849/characters/nm0004395?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Clyde"}]}]}

It's a pity CW dropped it i've seen much less funny shows which less talent go on for longer. Networks stick to shows that might not start out well but end up as classics. Case in point is Sienfeld, in this case the ratings were good so i don't see the justification for it. And with no due respect to the previous poster, really \"Holly Berry\"!!! that's just plain ignorance and it says everything i need to know about you. And oh, it is a race issue. PS:BET you need to keep the Jason Pitts character as a principle he was/is funnier than any of the character, plus Coby Bell's delivery of the lines is spot on. I should add that the Kelly character was a nice compliment to the Pitt's character, it just needs better writing (AND directing).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Promo Trailer - Season 8", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1030798873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM3ZDJhMDktN2IxNy00OTcwLThkZTAtNzUxNWZlOWRhODFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM3ZDJhMDktN2IxNy00OTcwLThkZTAtNzUxNWZlOWRhODFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A spinoff of Girlfriends (2000) featuring a group of women who all have relationships with professional football players.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-17T09:41:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1914898/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hosea Chanchez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0772137/characters/nm1914898?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Malik Wright"}, {"url": "#", "name": "144 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068117/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Coby Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0772137/characters/nm0068117?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Pitts"}, {"url": "#", "name": "131 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0610298/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tia Mowry-Hardrict"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0772137/characters/nm0610298?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Melanie Barnett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "97 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005275/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brandy Norwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0772137/characters/nm0005275?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chardonnay"}, {"url": "#", "name": "59 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0733185/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wendy Raquel Robinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0772137/characters/nm0733185?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tasha Mack"}, {"url": "#", "name": "144 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0356003/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pooch Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0772137/characters/nm0356003?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Derwin Davis"}, {"url": "#", "name": "99 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0199590/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brittany Daniel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0772137/characters/nm0199590?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kelly Pitts"}, {"url": "#", "name": "81 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2215284/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Barry Floyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0772137/characters/nm2215284?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tee Tee"}, {"url": "#", "name": "59 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}]}

I haven't watched this black and white cowboy show since it originally aired on network television back in the late Fifties and early Sixties. I must admit that I am really enjoying watching Dale Robertson as the Wells Fargo special agent or troubleshooter. The show brings to mind \"Have Gun, Will Travel.\" Hardie, like Paladin, is a man who would rather use his wits and wiles before resorting to his fists or weapon. Like Paladin, Joe Hardie, travels all over the west and into Canada, tracking down highway agents, frauds and thieves.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Starz Encore Westerns Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi998555929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWVkOTIzNDctNWIyZS00NGRmLTllN2ItMGI0ODYxMGY2ZDQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWVkOTIzNDctNWIyZS00NGRmLTllN2ItMGI0ODYxMGY2ZDQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Agent Jim Hardie shifts over its history from being mostly an Agent helping Wells Fargo cope with bad guys, to being the owner of a ranch near San Francisco, California, who still does some Agent work.", "uploadDate": "2020-10-06T13:29:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0731783/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dale Robertson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050066/characters/nm0731783?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Hardie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "201 episodes, 1957-1962"}]}]}

The point that make they different is the history of each country.\n\nThe American culture is formed by the problems in the middle class of the United States. United States of Tara has a plot, in my personal opinion, that shows the problems, desires and frustrations through the relationship of a family which has a mom suffering from personality disturb, played by Toni Collette. Each personality shows a piece of the middle class family. \n\nUntil this sitcom I have never saw Toni Collette as a great actress, since I saw her interpretation in United States of Tara, I must say that I'm in love for her work. She gave so much life for the personalities inside the character, that until now I am very impregnated. \n\nHence, this is a must see show. My only doubt here is if Diablo Cody will have the ability to continuous to write for several seasons without destroy the idea and keeping the viewers attention.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer - Season 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2215296537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNjYmFjMTktMTBhYi00OWQ3LWI2ZTYtMDVjNjNhZTMzZjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNjYmFjMTktMTBhYi00OWQ3LWI2ZTYtMDVjNjNhZTMzZjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A woman struggles to find a balance between her dissociative identity disorder and raising a dysfunctional family.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-13T09:51:44Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001057/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Toni Collette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001482/characters/nm0001057?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tara Gregson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1679669/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rosemarie DeWitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001482/characters/nm1679669?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charmaine Craine"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0488953/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brie Larson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001482/characters/nm0488953?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kate Gregson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1752259/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael J.

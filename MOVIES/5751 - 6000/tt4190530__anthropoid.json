His latest, written and directed by himself, is the true story during WWII in 1942, Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of SS General Reinhard Heydrich, Hilter's third in command and main architect of the Final Solution, better know as the Butcher of Prague, or the Blonde Beast and the Hangman. \n\nWe follow Slovak soldier, Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk played brilliantly by Cillian Murphy and his partner, Czech soldier Jan Kubi\u009a also played superbly by Jamie Dorman as they infiltrate Prague and proceed in setting up an action plan. We see the emotional struggle between the two comrades and fellow resistance, as priorities and understanding of what is to come, changes.\n\nToby Jones, who happens to get into everything recently, plays supportive uncle Hajsk\u0177 and I recognise Charlotte Le Bon from this year's Bastille Day. And I think the only native to act here is Czech model Anna Geislerov\u00e1 who looks a little like Joan Allen and Amber Valletta. Both the ladies playing the agent's counterparts to enforce their cover who eventually form an emotional bond. \n\nThe film starts off fairly slow in the months of preparation, a lot of political conflicts within the resistance due to knowing what the ramifications are likely to be, should they succeed. But the second part it's incredible, fierce and intense. The action sequences are captured excellently, giving a great sense of horrid realism and doesn't let up until the conclusion. The action reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, and the epic church scene was like the last stand at the Alamo. The resistance holding their position for over six gruelling hours as the hordes of Nazis attempt to breach the hideout. \n\nThe only foreign tongue we hear is German but it's nice and good effort hearing all the cast speak with an accent. Some of the movie is actually filmed at the locations in Prague adding to the realism of the film. It shows the brutality of Nazi Germany, the oppression people were under and what terrible fate was upon those who did not conform. The score, or lack of, was really good. Robin Foster managed to add suspense and silence was best suited for some of the more dramatic scenes. \n\nA classic war movie that's tense, tough and gory both physically and emotionally. A superb tribute to the Czech resistance and those that died during this time. Interestingly, C\u00e9dric Jimenez is currently directing HHhH, based on the very same story that's due out next year. I wonder how that will compare. \n\nRunning Time: 7 The Cast: 7 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 8 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 9 The ExtraBonus Points: 10 for being accurate to what stories have been told, paying a great tribute to those who were lost during this time. \n\n85% 9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Exclusive Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4081366041", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzOTM5NDM2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcxMzkxOTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzOTM5NDM2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcxMzkxOTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Based on the extraordinary true story of Operation Anthropoid, the WWII mission to assassinate SS General Reinhard Heydrich, the main architect behind the Final Solution and the Reich's third in command after Hitler and Himmler.", "uploadDate": "2016-06-16T09:27:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1946193/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jamie Dornan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm1946193?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jan Kubis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1340370/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brian Caspe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm1340370?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anton\u00edn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7649279/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "S\u00e1ra Arnsteinov\u00e1"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm7649279?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Woman at 44"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1382210/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sean Mahon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm1382210?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dr. Eduard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0233949/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marcin Dorocinski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm0233949?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ladislav Van\u00e9k"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0586261/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Alena Mihulov\u00e1"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm0586261?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Moravec"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3114649/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Charlotte Le Bon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm3114649?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Marie Kov\u00e1rn\u00edkov\u00e1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0312064/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Anna Geislerov\u00e1"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm0312064?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Lenka Fafkov\u00e1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0614165/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cillian Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm0614165?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Josef Gabc\u00edk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0379239/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Karel Herm\u00e1nek Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm0379239?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ign\u00e1c"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0293977/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hana Frejkov\u00e1"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm0293977?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mrs. Lukesov\u00e1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1675068/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jan H\u00e1jek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm1675068?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bretislav Bauman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429363/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Toby Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm0429363?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Uncle Hajsk\u00fd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2389463/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bill Milner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm2389463?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ata"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0722120/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Pavel Rezn\u00edcek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4190530/characters/nm0722120?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mr. Moravec"}]}]}

A couple of weeks later I went out to pick up a copy of this movie for myself, and ever since I've been watching it every now and then. Not every month, but at least once every 4 or 5 months. Sometimes more. There's just something about it that I like. Well, lets start from the beginning:\n\nIt is the year 2021 and the world has been taken over by large coorporations that do pretty much what they want to. Most of them are out to make money, however, and will do anything to achieve that goal. One of these coorporations is PharmaCom, a coorporation that deals in medicine and exists pretty much all over the world. From Beijing to Newark. 'Johnny' is a Mnemonic courier who carries an implant in his brain which allows him to carry a large amount of data there. But when he accepts a job where he is overloaded with data, he is not only experiencing trouble with getting rid of the data, but also finds that several bounty hunters and crime organizations are after his head and the information stored within. Over 24 hours he jumps around in the city of Newark, trying to find a way to get rid of the data and the bounty hunters.\n\nA touch in this movie that many might recognize from the film 'The Matrix' is that in this movie they tend to hook themselves up to the internet, which has become a virtual reality like, \u00e0l\u00e0 The Lawnmower man. But in the end of the film, Keanu's character completly hooks himself up to the internet for a short amount of time, walking around in it and controlling his actions as if he was in another world. Pretty much like he did in the Matrix. Wierd, huh?\n\nThe film presents a very interesting vision of the future. Coorporations, crime syndicates, virtual-reality, futuristic weapons and the like. The sets look authentic and the look and feel of the film is top-notch. The music seems to fit the mood at all times, too, which is a big plus. The characters are likeable and unique in their own way, but with one exception. Keanu Reeves plays 'Johnny' without any life or energy put into it and delivers his lines flat and in the most boring way. His worst acting job ever? Perhaps. You could tell he didn't like this movie very much.\n\n Overall, its a very interesting sci-fi flick which has its ups and downs. The upsides is the setting, the music, the vision of the future etc. etc. while the downsides are Keanu Reeve's acting and sometimes lack of interest in what happens next in the movie. I give it a 7/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Johnny Mnemonic", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3013187609", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2NjM5NDItODBlMC00MGU5LTk4MjgtZGY5MTlkNWFjNDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2NjM5NDItODBlMC00MGU5LTk4MjgtZGY5MTlkNWFjNDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Johnny Mnemonic", "uploadDate": "2010-12-12T06:16:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000206/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Keanu Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0000206?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Mnemonic"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001384/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ice-T"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0001384?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "J-Bone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0015124/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Denis Akiyama"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0015124?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Shinji"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0738433/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Henry Rollins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0738433?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Spider"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001424/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Udo Kier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0001424?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ralfi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0008938/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Falconer Abraham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0008938?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Yomamma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0150315/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Diego Chambers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0150315?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Henson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0256970/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arthur Eng"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0256970?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Viet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000539/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dina Meyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0000539?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001429/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Takeshi Kitano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0001429?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Takahashi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000185/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dolph Lundgren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0000185?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Street Preacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0837784/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Barbara Sukowa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0837784?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Anna Kalmann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005511/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tracy Tweed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0005511?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pretty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0290475/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Don Francks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0290475?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hooky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0589334/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sherry Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113481/characters/nm0589334?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Takahashi's Secretary"}]}]}

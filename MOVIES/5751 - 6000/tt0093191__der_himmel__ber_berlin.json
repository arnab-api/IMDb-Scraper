But there's nothing here which will try to appeal to your immediate senses. This is a poignantly beautiful metaphysical excursion on what it means to be human. Wim Wenders has recognized the metaphysical nature of the movie by dedicating it to Truffaut, Ozu and especially Tarkovskij. And everything -- the bleakness of the landscape, the ubiquity of the Berlin wall, the anguish in which the characters are immersed -- acquires a deeper meaning when we see it through the eyes of two angels. And the sky over Berlin, with its angels, is the only thing that keeps together two painfully divided sides of the city, and the only perspective from which to see it as one.\n\nBut handle with care: if you're looking for a movie with an enthralling plot, a clear language and a reasonable pace, you'll be disappointed. The first time I saw this movie with a friend we laughed all the way. I've seen it more 5-6 times now and I've stopped laughing. I sit there and I'm mesmerized.\n\nThe movie was born without a script and it is a melting pot with dialogues by Peter Handke, improvised monologues by the actors, connecting material written by Wim Wenders. In one example, Wenders indulges too long in a scene just because he regrets removing it due to all the work the actress has made for preparing to be a trapezist. This is clearly against all rules and all common sense.\n\nDespite all this the movie works and the reason is, the movie somehow manages to touch deep strings all the way through, because of its beautiful imagery (thanks to director of photography Henri Alekan), its eerie soundtrack, the disorderly collection of truly poetic dialogues/monologues, very inspired acting, and the impredictable combined effect of all this -- surely beyond what was planned by Wim Wenders himself. Should I add that the movie has created its own language for making its point?\n\nThe film has also become an incredible documentary on Berlin just before the fall of the wall."}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004486/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruno Ganz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0004486?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Damiel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0761420/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Otto Sander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0761420?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cassiel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000393/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Peter Falk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0000393?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Der Filmstar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932874/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Elmar Wilms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0932874?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "In weiteren Rollen - Ein trauriger Mann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0543659/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Beatrice Manowski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0543659?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "In weiteren Rollen - Das Strichm\u00e4dchen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0741148/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bruno Rosaz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0741148?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Im Zirkus - Der Clown"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0650849/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Chick Ortega"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0650849?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Im Zirkus - Der Schlagzeuger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0580694/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Christoph Merg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0580694?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Im Zirkus - Der Jongleure"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0231652/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Solveig Dommartin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0231652?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marion"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0092290/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Curt Bois"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0092290?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Homer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0830105/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hans Martin Stier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0830105?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "In weiteren Rollen - Der Sterbende"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0705129/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sigurd Rachman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0705129?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "In weiteren Rollen - Der Selbstm\u00f6rder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9635898/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lajos Kov\u00e1cs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm9635898?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Im Zirkus - Marion's Trainer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0677638/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Laurent Petitgand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0677638?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Im Zirkus - Der Kapellmeister"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0474198/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Otto Kuhnle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093191/characters/nm0474198?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Im Zirkus - Die Jongleure"}]}]}

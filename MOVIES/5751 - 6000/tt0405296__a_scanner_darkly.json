Losing the battle against the drug, the LAPD place an officer undercover as a substance D user. While the officer's identity is kept secret from his colleagues and superiors, he himself starts to lose touch with who he actually is meant to be. Becoming hooked on the drug himself and becoming friends with the people he is meant to be informing on, the officer starts to suffer a breakdown with memory and concentration loses combined with a loosening grip on reality.\n\nI had reasonably high hopes for this film but also the fear I have when anyone takes on material that some have called \"unfilmable\". Written at a time when his marriage had broken down and he himself was struggling with his drug use and split identities, Dick's material does offer much of interest as long as it can be delivered in such a way to be engaging and interesting. \"Making sense\" was not one of the qualities I really needed, which was just as well since narratively there isn't a lot to follow along with. Parts of it are funny, parts of it are trippy and parts of it are dramatic. However none of them really come together to produce anything of that much value. It is a shame that the ideas over identity, drugs and the morals of the war on drugs are not better played out. As it is I didn't think there was enough of interest and, with the narrative being so basic, what remained was surprisingly dull.\n\nThe use of the rotoscoping was a smart move and also serves as an interesting hook for multiplex audience (and I include myself therein, so it is not a snobbish reference) that have perhaps not seen it before. Linklater produces some good effects this way and it is hard to think of another approach working as well within the context of the material as it does. Sadly this is not enough to carry the film along, although it will be enough to satisfy some sections of the audience. The cast do the best they can within this unsuccessful mix and most of them are individually good here and there. Reeves is a natural stoner but he doesn't convince with his breakdown and confusion that well; he isn't helped by the lack of focus in the script but he can't lift it regardless. Downey Jr is very funny and convincing and wards off the boredom when he is near. Harrelson tries to follow suit but with a dumber character he just falls flat. Cochrane is more enjoyable and the animation really aids his performance. Ryder is OK but she has too much of the narrative to carry and she cannot do it.\n\nOverall this is an OK film at best. It is sporadically interesting, funny and engaging however it cannot find any consistency of tone, pace or engagement. The material is good enough to throw up interesting ideas and themes but Linklater sadly doesn't manage to do much with them across the film. The use of animation over the film cells is really well crafted and works well to support the material \u0096 it is just a shame then that the awareness and control that Linklater in this area he seems to lack in others."}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "A Scanner Darkly", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3384017177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODllNzNkYzEtMDRlZi00ODAxLWI4NDktYWNmZGRiYjU3YTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODllNzNkYzEtMDRlZi00ODAxLWI4NDktYWNmZGRiYjU3YTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T07:45:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0168262/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rory Cochrane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0168262?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charles Freck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1488987/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mitch Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm1488987?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brown Bear Lodge Host"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0021043/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sean Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0021043?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Additional Fred Scramble Suit Voice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0697637/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Steven Chester Prince"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0697637?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2301348/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Natasha Janina Valdez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm2301348?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ernie Luckman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1543425/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Angela Rawna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm1543425?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Medical Deputy #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2313622/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sarah Menchaca"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm2313622?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arctor's Daughter #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000375/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Downey Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0000375?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "James Barris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000206/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Keanu Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0000206?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bob Arctor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352316/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cliff Haby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0352316?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Voice from Headquarters"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000213/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Winona Ryder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0000213?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Donna Hawthorne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1104267/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mark Turner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm1104267?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Additional Hank Scramble Suit Voice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272393/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Chamblee Ferguson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm0272393?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Medical Deputy #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659626/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Eliza Stevens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0405296/characters/nm1659626?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Arctor's Daughter #1"}]}]}

It pokes fun at Stallone's most iconic role and at Deniro's Jake La Motta. Henry \"RAZOR\" Sharp is a talented tough Pittsburgh Boxer who has a rival in Kid MCdonnal. Both are talented and tough where Razor is humble Kid is loud. Where Both were at one time the Light heavyweight Champion of the world. Kid lets that define him Razor does not. When the first fight between them is hailed as a classic and the second fight breaks records and the fans demanding a third one. Razor walks away from billions back in 1984. the Why is a mystery. and the greatest rematch is only a fantasy. flash forward to 2012. Kid is a successful businessman owning a bar and a auto dealership and playing off of his boxing image. Razor is a welder at the dockyards and has been for the last thirty years. Both men are content. razor looks after his old trainer lighting played by Alan Arkin who steals the movie. When Razor and Kid's history is brought up on a sports show. the son of Razor's late manager comes to Razor with a offer film a video game with Kid. Needing the money he agrees to do it for 15 thousand. and when he meets Kid again their hatred for each other literally turns into a brawl that gets the world's attention. And the idea for the Grudge match is born. While training for it. Both men encounter secrets from their past. lost loves and most importantly grudging respect for one another. Stallone and Deniro play this one off wonderfully against one another. Stallone is the straight man and gets the best lines. Deniro is the comedic one and gets the best scenes. And Arkin steals the movie from under them. Grudge match is a good time at the movies . It's not what many people think it is. And because of that it's better then what people think it is."}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2557192473", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMjg2MzUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg3NDMyMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMjg2MzUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg3NDMyMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A pair of aging boxing rivals are coaxed out of retirement to fight one final bout -- 30 years after their last match.", "uploadDate": "2013-09-13T14:16:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0483915/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Lampley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm0483915?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Lampley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000134/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert De Niro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm0000134?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5206740/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ireland Baldwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm5206740?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Young Sally"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6102378/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mason Mackie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm6102378?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Young Dante"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0697587/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Barry Primus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm0697587?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joey the Bartender"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6146996/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Frederick Douglas Plunkett Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm6146996?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Walter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3378190/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jen Kober"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm3378190?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tough Female Customer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1011531/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Carrie Lazar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm1011531?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nora"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000230/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sylvester Stallone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm0000230?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Henry 'Razor' Sharp"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0514648/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rich Little"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm0514648?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Boxing Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1101416/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anthony Bean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm1101416?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dante Slate, Sr."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0366389/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kevin Hart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm0366389?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dante Slate, Jr."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4460264/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Oscar Gale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm4460264?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shipyard Co-Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1185051/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "BJ Guyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm1185051?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jabby the Puppet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0026364/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Anthony Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1661382/characters/nm0026364?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mr. Sandpaper Hands"}]}]}

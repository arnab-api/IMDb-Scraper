The film perfectly captures the time frame of what is indisputably the music and cultural phenomenon known as Punk Rock, the only blight on this great piece of work is the ending, which as Cox agrees is far too romanticised after the harshness the viewer has just sat thru. Yet this film ranks as one of the most honest and frank music biography movies out on the market, and I urge anyone who stays away from it because of an aversion to Punk and it's offshoots to seek it out ASAP.\n\nThe acting from Gary Oldman & Chloe Webb is nothing short of amazing, the photography from Roger Deakins is very impressive......\n\n...witness a scene as Vicious leaves a New Jersey prison and walks across a deserted scrap heap with New York prominent in the background, the twin towers cloaked in cloud . The direction is smart, funny, and handled perfectly {till that ending }, and the music arrangement is done adroitly by all involved, but I have to say that viewing it now and hearing Joe Strummer sing Love Kills at the closing credits gives me an added emotional kicker {SO YES A LITTLE BIAS HERE FROM ME }.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sid and Nancy: 30th Anniversary", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2591405849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyOWFkZmYtNzA2NC00ZmUyLTk2OGMtNjk2NWJiOTEzMGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyOWFkZmYtNzA2NC00ZmUyLTk2OGMtNjk2NWJiOTEzMGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Sid and Nancy: 30th Anniversary", "uploadDate": "2016-07-28T14:46:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000198/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gary Oldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0000198?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sid Vicious"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0371342/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "David Hayman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0371342?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Malcolm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0774508/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Andrew Schofield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0774508?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0072610/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Perry Benson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0072610?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0056310/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sandy Baron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0056310?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hotelier - U.S.A."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0876128/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Edward Tudor-Pole"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0876128?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hotelier - U.K."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001482/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Courtney Love"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0001482?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gretchen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0816481/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Spacely"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0816481?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Chelsea Resident"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0916050/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chloe Webb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0916050?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nancy Spungen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0084033/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Debby Bishop"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0084033?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Phoebe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0075359/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Xander Berkeley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0075359?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bowery Snax"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0518793/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tony London"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0518793?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Steve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0724784/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sy Richardson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0724784?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Methadone Caseworker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0947010/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Biff Yeager"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0947010?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Detective"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0088561/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rusty Blitz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091954/characters/nm0088561?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Reporter"}]}]}

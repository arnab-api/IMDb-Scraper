This is not on the same level as 80s catastrophes like \"Megaforce\", \"Grease 2\", \"Howard the Duck\", or (heaven help us) \"Staying Alive\". \"Perfect\" is nothing more than tragic misfire from extremely talented director James Bridges (\"The Paper Chase\", \"Urban Cowboy\") that makes the dire mistake of treating the aerobics, health club fad of the mid-80s as a serious cultural phenomenon (ugh).\n\nIt also helped to derail John Travolta's career for the better part of a decade - sad, because all one has to do is take a look at his outstanding performances in \"Blow Out\" and \"Urban Cowboy\" and realize that his acting in \"Perfect\" was just fine (if a bit low key). It's a shame, he could have made a lot of great movies while he was stuck in dreck like \"The Experts\" and strange late 80s Altman theatre pieces like Pinter's \"The Dumb Waiter\" (with Tom Conti!).\n\nTravolta plays a Rolling Stone journalist hot on the trail of a big story about how health clubs are the new pick-up joints, replacing singles bars. He meets \"The Pied Piper of aerobics teachers\" Jamie Lee Curtis, a former Olymic swimmer who was once burned by a journalist over a piece about how she was having an affair with her coach. Of course, she and Travolta hook up and Travolta meets some other folks who frequent the gym, who are like supporting characters in a David Lynch movie (I'm unsure if the director intended to portray them as weird as they come off).\n\nReal-life Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner shows up to essentially play himself (not very well) and, in the film's most laughable detail, Travolta writes a version of his story portraying health clubs as Emersonian watering holes of the future (or something like that).\n\nIt's all kind of bloated and weird, but really not that bad. Travolta's actually pretty good. Jamie Lee Curtis looks great but comes off as slightly grouchy, but she was probably directed that way.\n\nDon't miss Travolta's notorious pelvic thrust sequence (you can't miss it).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi402571545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk1YTgzYjgtNzJhZS00ODRhLThhNTItYjM5Y2FlNDMxNGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk1YTgzYjgtNzJhZS00ODRhLThhNTItYjM5Y2FlNDMxNGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-10-21T21:39:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0255036/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ramey Ellis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0255036?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "City News Receptionist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910112/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Perla Walter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0910112?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Grieving Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000237/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Travolta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0000237?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Adam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0317369/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Stefan Gierasch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0317369?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Charlie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0211408/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Anne De Salvo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0211408?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Frankie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0771680/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tom Schiller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0771680?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carly Simon's Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242886/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Murphy Dunne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0242886?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Peckerman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0489644/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Laskin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0489644?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Government Prosecutor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0069608/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alma Beltran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0069608?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Grieving Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0603740/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gina Morelli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0603740?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Grieving Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0621049/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Napierala"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0621049?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "City News Editor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0921048/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jann Wenner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0921048?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mark Roth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0217103/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Philippe Delgrange"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0217103?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maitre d' in New York"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0448824/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Paul Kent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0448824?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Judge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0920564/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kenneth Welsh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089798/characters/nm0920564?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Joe McKenzie"}]}]}

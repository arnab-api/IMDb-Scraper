The writer has not even tried to confuse it with the screenplay.\n\nThe focus thriller has been more of an issue than coherent, with short twists and turns. The essence of the entire series, which hinges on it, is also known to the viewer in the opening scenes. However, it is accurately revealed in the last episode.\n\nHowever, the story of this series seems to be slow in some places, especially the prison scenes are repeated at times.\n\nThe web series 'Criminal Justice-Behind Closed Doors' may have been described as a courtroom drama, but you will be disappointed if you sit around expecting a suspense thriller to watch it. Watch it calmly.\n\nPankaj Tripathi, Anupriya Goenka, and Mita Vashistha are associated with the first season of Criminal Justice, have also looked strong in this season.\n\nThere is a truth, understanding, and compassion in the character of advocate Madhav Mishra, played by Pankaj Tripathi with all sincerity.\n\nAt the same time, Anupriya Goenka has also done full justice to her character. On her part, the director has given many important dialogues, which she has been successful in bringing out effectively.\n\nAlso, artists like Jishu Sengupta, Ashish Vidyarthi, Adrija Sinha, Pankaj Saraswat, Ayaz Khan, Kalyani Mule, Ajit Singh Palawat, Khushbu Atre have fully supported the story.\n\nIt would not be wrong to say that the characters of 'Criminal Justice' are a strong side of this series.\n\nThe story revolves primarily around Anu Chandra, played by Kirti Kulhari. The actress has already won her acting in films and series like Pink, Mission Mangal, Uri, Four More Shots Please.\n\nIn 'Criminal Justice', she also appears to be dissolved in her character. In short dialogues, Kirti continues to connect with the audience with her gestures.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1427554585", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VjOTE1MzktNmNiNi00MGUwLWE0OTctNWE2YjgwOWIzYWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VjOTE1MzktNmNiNi00MGUwLWE0OTctNWE2YjgwOWIzYWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "What made Anu Chandra stab her perfect husband?

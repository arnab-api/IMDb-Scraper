What grows between these two is something most people only wish to have in their lives. What is so special about it, though?\n\nFrom the beginning of their relationship, the two are forced to be together. Daisy is forced to have a driver and Hoke is hired on for that position. For both, the relationship is one out of need.  Hoke needs a paying job and Daisy needs a driver in her old age (although, she would never admit it to anyone especially herself).\n\nAs time goes by, though, Daisy's need of Hoke becomes clearer to herself. She begins to depend on him.  This is definitely made clear at the end when Hoke is feeding Daisy her pumpkin pie, and she enjoys each bite fully.\n\nAnother aspect of the movie which got to me was the great array of choices the director made with the filming.  Hoke is a character of very few words but teaches Daisy so much.  Morgan Freeman's acting in this character is amazing.  The knowledge he shows within his eyes is one reason I almost felt closer to him than Daisy did throughout the first half of the movie.  In a way, he teaches her a new way of life.  He does so by showing himself truly and honestly.\n\nAnother choice the director made was in the symbolic way the film was made. The beauty of the many seasons is shown through the changes of the landscape.  The trees transform from winter to spring and the streets go from sheets of ice to warm asphalt.  And the cars get larger and more high tech.  Time is so important in Daisy's and Hoke's affection/friendship that this is a great way to show that.\n\nThere are so many aspects of this film which I could go on and on about. It is a wonderful film of which any person can get a fulfilling movie watching experience out of.  They can also learn a lot from it, too!  Watch it."}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000151/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Morgan Freeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097239/characters/nm0000151?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hoke Colburn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000101/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dan Aykroyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097239/characters/nm0000101?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Boolie Werthan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0738354/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Esther Rolle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097239/characters/nm0738354?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Idella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0355253/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "William Hall Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097239/characters/nm0355253?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Oscar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0311951/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Clarice F.

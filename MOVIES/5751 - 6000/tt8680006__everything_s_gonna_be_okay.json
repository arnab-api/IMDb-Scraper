I think the two daughters are both great actresses and characters, and I'm enjoying the relationship between Nick and Alex. I thought Nicholas's character was unnecessarily childish during some of the scenes in the first half of the pilot, but he got better even in just that episode.

I certainly hope that group is not the focus of too many episodes, though. I will definitely keep watching!

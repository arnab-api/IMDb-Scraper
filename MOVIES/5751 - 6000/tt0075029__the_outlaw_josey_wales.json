This film as it turned out, was one of Clint's best and certainly ranks up there with the more popular \"Unforgiven\" (1992).\n\nJosie Wales (Eastwood) is a dirt farmer in Missouri during the American Civil War. One day a group of yankee raiders led by Captain \"Red Legs\" Terrill (Bill McKinny) attacks and burns his farm and murders his wife and young son while leaving Josie for dead. As Josie ponders what to do next a group of southern raiders led by \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson (John Russell) takes him into his gang to seek his revenge.\n\nAfter the South surrenders, a fellow southerner, Fletcher (John Vernon) offers the remaining members of Anderson's gang amnesty if they will swear allegiance to the North. All but Wales agree. Unbeknownst to Fletcher, the men are suddenly murdered by the Union soldiers led by Terrill and in spite of Josie's efforts, only he and a young soldier names Jamie (Sam Bottoms) escape. Terrill and Fletcher are sent to hunt down the fugitives.\n\nJamie soon dies from his wounds and Josie is left alone. He makes for Mexico but is joined first by Lone Watie (Chief Dan George), then Little Moonlight (Geraldine Kearns) whom Josie rescues from a trading post and finally Laura Lee (Sondra Locke) and Grandma Sarah (Paula Trueman) who he rescues from a gang of Commancheros.\n\nThe group makes for Texas where Grandma Sarah's son has left her a ranch. All the time Josie is being pursued by Terrill and assorted bounty hunters. Josie dispatches several of them with his brace of Colt 45 horse pistols.\n\nFinally at the ranch, the group sets up a home and Josie begins to fall for Laura Lee. Fearing an Indian attack, Josie rides to meet with Chief Ten Bears (Will Sampson) and makes peace with him. But finally Terrill and his group of \"Red Legs\" tracks Josie down and..........\n\nEastwood who also directed the movie, plays Wales with his usual grim faced persons. He's not afraid to pull his pistols and dispose of anyone who stands in his way. Interestingly enough, Eastwood cast all of the principal Native roles with native actors and treated them as equals and not in the old Hollywood tradition.\n\nAn excellent western in every way.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H15M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Outlaw Josey Wales: Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1424268569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0MTZjYjItOGIxMS00ZDFjLTk2NzctMjQxZmQ4NTY4ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0MTZjYjItOGIxMS00ZDFjLTk2NzctMjQxZmQ4NTY4ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the trailer for the western The Outlaw Josey Wales, starring Clint Eastwood.", "uploadDate": "2011-03-31T13:25:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000142/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clint Eastwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0000142?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Josey Wales"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0516800/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sondra Locke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0516800?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006893/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Vernon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0006893?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Fletcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0098734/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sam Bottoms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0098734?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jamie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0661416/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Woodrow Parfrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0661416?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Carpetbagger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0941125/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sheb Wooley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0941125?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Travis Cobb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164273/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Matt Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0164273?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kelly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0760225/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Will Sampson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0760225?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ten Bears"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0313381/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chief Dan George"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0313381?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lone Watie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0571853/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bill McKinney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0571853?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Terrill"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0874119/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paula Trueman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0874119?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Grandma Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0443789/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Geraldine Keams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0443789?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Little Moonlight"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0417055/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joyce Jameson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0417055?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0200455/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Royal Dano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0200455?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ten Spot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0894891/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John Verros"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075029/characters/nm0894891?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Chato"}]}]}

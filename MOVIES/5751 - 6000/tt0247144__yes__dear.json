Every episode has made us laugh. It is the ONLY show I've watched that I know I'll laugh for 30 minutes! Every character is so good. Greg Warner is outstanding!I don't understand why critics are smashing the show. It is so much better than Everybody Loves Raymond & King of Queens. The \"Boys\"(JImmy & Greg) are hysterical! I haven't laughed this much in a long time!! I hope the show stays! The writing is well done. We used to be fans of Friends . I don't think Friends was as funny as YES,DEAR.Were getting all our friends hooked.Keep it up!!LOL, LOL thats what we want!The only disappointment...they changed the introduction, I liked the old one better.Great Show, Guys!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2423373337", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1ZjUxYWQtOGVjOC00MTVmLTg3NWUtODAwYjMwMmVmZWUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1ZjUxYWQtOGVjOC00MTVmLTg3NWUtODAwYjMwMmVmZWUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-18T22:37:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0163659/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Anthony Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247144/characters/nm0163659?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gregory Thomas 'Greg' Warner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "122 episodes, 2000-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0446465/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jean Louisa Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247144/characters/nm0446465?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kim Warner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "122 episodes, 2000-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0811513/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Liza Snyder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247144/characters/nm0811513?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christine Hughes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "122 episodes, 2000-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005282/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mike O'Malley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0247144/characters/nm0005282?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jimmy Hughes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "122 episodes, 2000-2006"}]}]}

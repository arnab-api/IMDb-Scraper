Among them the stunning Christina Hendricks and former child star Bailee Madison.\n\nThankfully what we're presented with isn't so one sided and does have a plot. Sure the plot is the time honored generic slasher one but it's a plot all the same.\n\nSo what does it have going for it? Well for a start the soundtrack is great as is the score. It fits the movie perfectly and is refreshingly retro. Ontop of that we have some great cinematography, the movie certainly has style.\n\nSo it looks great, it sounds great and we have Hendricks on board. So what went wrong? Well other than it being generic, Hendricks isn't the big character you'd imagine so forget about her being the leading lady. To make matters worse it falls into many of the standard slasher pitfalls so we've seen the majority of it before.\n\nThis is a vast improvement over the first movie, but it's still just another slasher.\n\nThe Good:\n\nChristina Hendricks\n\nA few decent shots\n\nFitting soundtrack\n\nThe Bad:\n\nChristina Hendricks is wasted\n\nGeneric stuff\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nI'm glad I'm not the only one who awkwardly laughs when in pain\n\nIf they keep up with the improvements they might have an average movie eventually", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3700209689", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWY4OTVjZTQtOTUxMS00NmU5LWE1YmYtMDY2YWJlYTFiZWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWY4OTVjZTQtOTUxMS00NmU5LWE1YmYtMDY2YWJlYTFiZWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A family's road trip takes a dangerous turn when they arrive at a secluded mobile home park to stay with some relatives and find it mysteriously deserted.

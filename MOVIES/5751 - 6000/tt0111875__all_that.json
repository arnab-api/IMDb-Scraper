Be warned this is just a long overdrawn complaint. When I was a kid this show was classic, It made us kids feel like we had a show just like SNL, and it was funny. Now, we have fear factor like antics, no talent actresses that seem to ride the coat tails of their older sister, and no imitations, what happened to kids imitating their older actor counterparts. Much like new SNL, new All That has gone down the crapper, metaphorically speaking, Nick needs to bring back their classic shows for their younger viewers, soon."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1356598/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Soup"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111875/characters/nm1356598?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Announcer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "128 episodes, 1994-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0465741/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin Kopelow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111875/characters/nm0465741?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "83 episodes, 1994-2000"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004789/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Amanda Bynes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111875/characters/nm0004789?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Regular Performer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "56 episodes, 1996-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785805/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Josh Server"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111875/characters/nm0785805?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Various"}, {"url": "#", "name": "105 episodes, 1994-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0860380/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kenan Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111875/characters/nm0860380?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Various"}, {"url": "#", "name": "57 episodes, 1994-2005"}]}]}

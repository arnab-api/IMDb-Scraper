Roger Donaldson also directed The Bank Job (2008) which is one of Jason Statham' best movie. Let me tell you how excited I was when I heard that Pierce Brosnan was returning as a spy; A little bit nostalgic. This film is full of classic spy clich\u00e9 such as, for instance, people walking away slow motion explosions and it doesn't seem to get started until half way through. However towards the third act the movie really showed itself and I was like: \"Why didn't they do that from the beginning?\" Unfortunately, the fact is that it's so terribly clich\u00e9 since the beginning that when you see where things are going and certain puzzle pieces start to make sense, you are already checked out of the movie. Yet, Pierce Brosnan is great; he could play this role eyes closed. Olga Kurylenko is good as well, you grow some sympathy for her character and the movie takes on a completely different meaning when you realised certain things about her. Plus, I have to point out that women are over objectify and her character is only introduced when it's convenient for the man to have a bargaining girl which isn't as cool as it sounds. Brosnan's protegee starring Luke Bracey is pretty cool as well and I think this guy's got a future. This movie reminds me of two other movies released this years: 3 Days to Kill and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. \n\nOverall I think The November Man could have been a lot better thanks to a stronger writing and directing; it's good to see Pierce Brosnan back into the spy game.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3721243673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An ex-CIA operative is brought back in on a very personal mission and finds himself pitted against his former pupil in a deadly game involving high level CIA officials and the Russian president-elect.", "uploadDate": "2014-07-25T10:36:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000112/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Pierce Brosnan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm0000112?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Devereaux"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1385871/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Olga Kurylenko"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm1385871?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alice Fournier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3810545/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Amila Terzimehic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm3810545?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alexa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1566592/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mediha Musliovic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm1566592?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Natalia Ulanova"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0778741/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Caterina Scorsone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm0778741?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Celia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001599/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Will Patton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm0001599?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Perry Weinstein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1180242/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dragan Marinkovic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm1180242?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Denisov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0863794/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Milos Timotijevic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm0863794?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Federov's Chief of Staff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3478396/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Luke Bracey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm3478396?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Mason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0810488/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bill Smitrovich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm0810488?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hanley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0728476/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lazar Ristovski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm0728476?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Arkady Federov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1343638/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eliza Taylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm1343638?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2009056/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Akie Kotabe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm2009056?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Meyers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1171145/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Patrick Kennedy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm1171145?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Edgar Simpson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3243208/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ben Willens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402157/characters/nm3243208?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Agent Jones"}]}]}

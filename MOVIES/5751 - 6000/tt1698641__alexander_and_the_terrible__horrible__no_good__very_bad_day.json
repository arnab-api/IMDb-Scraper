Another movie with over-the-top sight gags that would never happen in reality and are unable to entertain adult viewers. \n\nBut this Alexander is not terrible. Instead it takes the high road in the family movie category by not depicting a dysfunctional family but instead showing us how parents and kids can pull together and overcome difficult circumstances. I was impressed that all the \"terrible\" things that happen could pretty much actually occur. And with four kids myself, let me assure you that some days really do play out similar to the one shown here. Of course, they aren't quite this crazy, but they are realistic enough family-inclined that will be able to relate to the antics on screen, and that's what makes the humor in this movie work so well.\n\nI was also pleased to see two parents who are not \"stupid\". Both the father and mother are intelligent and hard working and are doing their best to make a bad day better for their kids. Call it sentimental if you wish, but for those of us with family experiences I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how entertaining and touching this film is. Within the scope of similar movies, this one is an 8 out of 10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H21M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3376196889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4ODQxNDI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg0NjY3MTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4ODQxNDI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg0NjY3MTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "11-year-old Alexander experiences the most terrible and horrible day of his young life - a day that begins with gum stuck in his hair, followed by one calamity after another.

They care nothing about school or really anything for that matter. They do however constantly show interest in \"scoring\" (losing their virginity), drinking alcohol, smoking, stealing and an endless list of other possible miscreant activity. Church groups and many adults shunned the show while the majority of those in the huge 15 to 30 age group demographic loved and embraced the program wholeheartedly. A civil war between viewers would then of course start, with the youths of the country winning or did they (the fact that the show pretty much stopped after the theatrical movie makes you wonder if the program didn't go too far with the wrong people)? I personally love the series even today. Creator Mike Judge (who does most all the voices of the insane characters) actually does what his title says: he was creative. The creativity of the series (which ran from 1993-1997 on cable's MTV) is outstanding. Stuff like \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" is simply to entertain and make its audience feel good about itself (I mean no one could be as moronic as these characters are, could they?). You have to look at the material through a looking-glass to understand the pressures, situations and feelings that many adolescents have in this day and age. Even though the series is not really thought-provoking per se, it still strikes a cord because it pokes fun at sometimes very serious matters. I think this is the reason why some refused to ever embrace the show. If \"The Simpsons\" knocked on the conventional programming door in 1989, then \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" definitely tore that door down in 1993. And of course more wonderful animated programming like \"King of the Hill\" (also by Judge) and \"Family Guy\" would follow. Is \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" art? I don't know, but to be honest I have never really cared if it is or not. 5 stars out of 5."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Beavis And Butt-Head: Memories Collection", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi873137945", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkxNDdmNjQtZGE0Mi00ZWY2LThhMGYtMzJlYWZhYmE0MGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkxNDdmNjQtZGE0Mi00ZWY2LThhMGYtMzJlYWZhYmE0MGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home video trailer for this comedy show", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T14:55:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0431918/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mike Judge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0105950/characters/nm0431918?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Beavis"}, {"url": "#", "name": "209 episodes, 1993-2011"}]}]}

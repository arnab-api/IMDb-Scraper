And unlike many, I did liked that early attempt and still do but this, however, COMPLETELY BLOWS IT AWAY!! Bigger budget, better animation, better action, better plot and way more GORE.\n\nThe story follows Hellsing organization which has only one goal, to rid the world from vampires/monsters. And they accomplish this mainly by their trump card, ALUCARD (DRACULA in reverse), an immortal and powerful vampire that does the bidding of his master, the leader of the organization, Integra Hellsing.\n\nSince they followed the manga to the fullest, the story this time around was a lot better and actually went somewhere. Still, plot isn't the reason to watch this anime because its the action and gore and the awesomeness of Alucard that makes Hellsing a joy to watch. The anime is filled with gruesome bloody sequences with people and monsters being totally decimated in thrilling and amazing ways.\n\nALUCARD is probably the most badass and awesome Anti-hero I have ever seen in an anime. He taunts and humiliates his enemies before ripping them to shreds, takes extreme joy in the act and really defines the word MONSTER when doing all this. But at the same side you see that he has a softer side which he hardly ever shows and there is more to him then just being an all out monster. Also, I don't think I've ever seen the main character to be THE STRONGEST in the whole anime and the world it shows. Usually the hero/anti- hero/lead has to train hard, overcome obstacles, acquire knowledge and powers to become strong and defeat the enemy. But not here. Hellsing's like \"Screw all that. Alucard is the most powerful. Enjoy.\". And I loved this. Such a refreshing thing to see.\n\nThe anime isn't without its flaws however. One thing that REALLY bugged me is that when all the stuff is going down, carnage and destruction everywhere, the anime decides to take the time off and do some character development or deliver a monologue or a speech or something. But it wasn't never really good at this stuff so it turns into a drag and all you want is to see more action. The pacing wasn't that good at times. And then there were those typical anime comedy thrown in the mix, which popped up in the most atmosphere breaking moments and really annoyed me, only a few times it was actually funny and worked.\n\nAnimation quality was superb. Detailed characters and violence and stuff. The soundtrack was a mixed bag.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the anime. It's a definite watch for anyone who wants vampire centric story without any lovey dovey/teenage/high school stupidity and just delivers the awesome gory action we want.\n\n8.3/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1209832/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Katie Gray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm1209832?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Seras Victoria"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2006-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0367846/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Victoria Harwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm0367846?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2006-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0620124/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "J\u00f4ji Nakata"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm0620124?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alucard"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2006-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0757058/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Yoshiko Sakakibara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm0757058?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2006-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1072611/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "JB Blanc"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm1072611?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Enrico Maxwell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2006-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0523180/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Yuri Lowenthal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm0523180?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Captain Pip Bernadotte"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2007-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0043552/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Taliesin Jaffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm0043552?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Wild Geese Member"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2006-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0293342/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Crispin Freeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm0293342?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alucard"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2006-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1079863/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ralph Lister"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0495212/characters/nm1079863?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Walter C.

'Bringing Out the Dead' stars Nicholas Cage (while he was still highly-bankable at the Box Office) as a New York ambulance driver who's on the brink of burning out completely. He's seemingly lost the ability to sleep (properly) and turned to various substances to get himself through his - increasingly dangerous - nightshifts.\n\nNow, back in 1999 when this film was released, Cage was pretty much at the top of his game and you could guarantee that he'd put in a good performance, especially under an equally great director. Here we have none other than Martin Scorsese at the helm who is more than capable at keeping hold of Cage's reigns and making sure he doesn't do that 'over the topness' he sometimes slips into. The premise is great and there's plenty of scope for the story and characters to evolve. The films sports an equally impressive supporting cast including Patricia Arquette, Ving Rhames and John Goodman. So, baring all that in mind, it's hard to see that anything could go wrong with it.\n\nI certainly don't hate 'Bringing Out the Dead.' I just feel that with that much talent at its disposal it should be a lot better than it is. The actors and direction are amazing, but where it falls down is a general lack of focus as to where the story is going and what genre the film wants to be. It flips from everything from romantic comedy to gritty drama almost every other scene and even flirts with the possibility of a supernatural element (loosely). There's not an awful lot of motivation for the supporting cast and they just seem to do things to provide Cage with something bad/dramatic to react to. The films plays out like a string of sketches/mini episodes that are loosely strung together by the flimsy of narratives.\n\nIf you're a fan of Cage and/or Scorsese, this is a 'must watch.' However, some may get a little tired with waiting for something to happen.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bringing Out the Dead", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1002176793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjlmMmMxZTYtZjg2MC00OWFlLWI4MjktNDExN2UzYTZlYjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjlmMmMxZTYtZjg2MC00OWFlLWI4MjktNDExN2UzYTZlYjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Paramount", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:52:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000115/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicolas Cage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163988/characters/nm0000115?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frank Pierce"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000422/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Goodman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163988/characters/nm0000422?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Larry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001744/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tom Sizemore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163988/characters/nm0001744?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tom Wolls"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002148/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Beth Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163988/characters/nm0002148?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nurse Constance"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785594/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nestor Serrano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163988/characters/nm0785594?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dr. Hazmat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0812308/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sonja Sohn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163988/characters/nm0812308?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kanita"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0648416/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Afemo Omilami"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0163988/characters/nm0648416?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Griss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0621597/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arthur J.

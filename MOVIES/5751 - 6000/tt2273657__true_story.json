As the movie opens, we see some brutal images of a young child being stuffed into a suitcase, which later turns up in the water. What is going on here? After the opening credits, we get to know Michael Finkel (played by Jonah Hill), a New York Times reporter, as he interviews young men somewhere in Africa. Alas, later on he is caught fabricating some of the facts for the subsequent NYT piece and he is let go in disgrace. Meanwhile, we get to know Christian Longo (played by James Franco), accused of killed his wife and 3 young kids. When he is rounded up, he claims to be Michael Finkel, NYT reporter. It is not long before Longo makes contact, from jail, with the real Mike Finkel. To tell you more would spoil your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: \"True Story\" is based on the Mike Finkel book of the same name, and if of course a true story. The premise of the movie is really intriguing (and cleverly played up in the trailer), reason I went to see this in the first place, namely is Longo somehow playing Finkel, while being in jail, and if so, what disastrous effects could that have for Finkel? Alas, in the movie it doesn't bear out. There is lots of build up in the movie, and ultimately not enough pay-off. I am all for a long build-up, but there has to be a reward for sticking with the build up, and when the reward finally comes, it's simply not enough. A quick word about the acting performances: James Franco does what he can with the limited material that is given to him. Jonah Hill is okay as the disgraced NYT reporter. The real star of the movie Felicity Jones in the role of Jill, the girlfriend of Mike Finkel. I also want to give props to prolific soundtrack composer Marco Beltrami (recently of The November Man; The Drop; The Giver, just to name those), who once again provides a lovely soundtrack.\n\nThe early evening theater screening where I saw this at was attended not very well (less than 10 people), but in fairness, it was a weekday evening. That said, while this is not a 'bad' movie per se, nor do I feel that the movie is all that it could've become. That said, if you have a chance to check out \"True Story\", be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, I suggest you do and draw your own conclusion.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi111980057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MzI1MTA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MzU3MzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MzI1MTA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk2MzU3MzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A drama centered around the relationship between journalist Michael Finkel and Christian Longo, an FBI Most Wanted List murderer who for years lived outside the U.S. under Finkel's name.", "uploadDate": "2014-12-19T13:36:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1706767/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jonah Hill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm1706767?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Finkel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428065/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Felicity Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0428065?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jill Barker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0839486/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ethan Suplee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0839486?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Pat Frato"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6300242/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Charlotte Driscoll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm6300242?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sadie Longo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121559/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Robert John Burke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0121559?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Greg Ganley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001543/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gretchen Mol"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0001543?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Karen Hannen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0057592/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Seth Barrish"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0057592?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Blaise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0183613/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Countryman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0183613?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Coroner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0290556/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "James Franco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0290556?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christian Longo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1978694/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Maria Dizzia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm1978694?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "MaryJane Longo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4995441/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Conor Kikot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm4995441?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Zach Longo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6402061/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Stella Rae Payne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm6402061?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Madison Longo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0421120/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Byron Jennings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0421120?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Judge Odenkirk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2365811/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Betty Gilpin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm2365811?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cheryl Frank"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822802/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Robert Stanton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2273657/characters/nm0822802?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jeffrey Gregg"}]}]}

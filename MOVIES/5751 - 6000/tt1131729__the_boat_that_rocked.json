Among unreal situations, a totally-lacking plot, among odd and eccentric characters, what only matters is that power of music to revive one's spirits, to give voice to the most uncontrolled, animal, ancestral instincts of man. And thus becomes, in my opinion, the most vivid scene that of those hundreds of records floating on the water, the symbol of a generation, of an era that was then ready to explode, and that no strict establishment could have wiped away, even once illegal radio stations were shut down.\n\nNo revolutionary message is conveyed: it's a good-humoured and at intervals melancholic tribute to a generation who, maybe ingenuously, but deeply, and truly believed in out of time-values, friendship, respect, love, and believed that music was a strong, and powerfully effective means to convey them. Even if you don't belong to that generation, each of us has experienced, one or more times in one's life, the communion of a piece of music with the most sensitive chords of our soul: it's about something emotional, but also physical and that's what the director just wants to celebrate. \n\nIf you are fond of music, or simply you have once in your life been moved by a song, you will like this movie, or at least enjoy it for what it is, without the necessity of too much criticism.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pirate Radio", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1266090521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ODk3MTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM5NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ODk3MTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM5NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A comedy about an illegal radio station in the North Sea in the 1960s", "uploadDate": "2009-09-23T03:58:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352905/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Hadley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0352905?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mr. Roberts"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0281727/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lucy Fleming"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0281727?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mrs. Roberts"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0836432/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tom Sturridge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0836432?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Carl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0631490/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bill Nighy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0631490?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Quentin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1623508/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tom Brooke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm1623508?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Thick Kevin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0296545/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nick Frost"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0296545?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1483369/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Chris O'Dowd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm1483369?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Simon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0601891/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stephen Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0601891?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Prime Minister"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2185462/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Charlie Rowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm2185462?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "James"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000450/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Philip Seymour Hoffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0000450?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "The Count"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0580270/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ian Mercer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0580270?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Transfer Boatman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011451/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Will Adamsdale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0011451?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "News John"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1055302/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rhys Darby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm1055302?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Angus Nutsford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1817670/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Katherine Parkinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm1817670?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Felicity"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0357907/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ike Hamilton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1131729/characters/nm0357907?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Harold"}]}]}

The renowned writer of Juno is making a entirely different attempt here by depicting a mid-life crisis of Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) and her return visit to her hometown where she lived when she was a teenager.\n\nMavis hated the town, hated everything about it, hated all the people in it, that was, except Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), who used to be her boyfriend. It didn't take her long to decide that she would return and rescue Buddy who she thought was a hostage in the deadly town with his marriage and newborn daughter. She would save herself from the disappointment from her life, save Buddy from the living hell, and picked up where things ended, once and for all.\n\nAnd well, you expected it. Things were not as simple as that; they never are. So get ready for the adventure in this visit and get ready to know our Mavis better.\n\nCharlize Theron totally manipulated the role of Mavis, letting the audience get to know who Mavis Gary really was as the events continued to unfold. It was a solid, realistic and Oscar-worthy performance that blew the audience away.\n\nYoung Adult is about life, about the past and the present, about why people are easily stuck in the past and do not see a future ahead of them. This is about why we should accept the present and look forward instead of always looking back. It is also more of a drama than a comedy but still it did give me some laughs.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3380715033", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzU1MDc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMzODg4Ng@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzU1MDc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMzODg4Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A fiction writer returns to her home in small-town Minnesota, looking to rekindle a romance with her ex-boyfriend, who is now married with kids.", "uploadDate": "2011-10-08T08:24:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000234/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlize Theron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm0000234?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mavis Gary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0933940/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Patrick Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm0933940?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Buddy Slade"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2180792/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Collette Wolfe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm2180792?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sandra Freehauf"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0063592/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Richard Bekins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm0063592?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "David Gary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2607692/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kate Nowlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm2607692?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mary Ellen Trantowski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4791749/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rebecca Hart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm4791749?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nipple Confusion Guitarist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1151637/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Elizabeth Ward Land"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm1151637?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sales Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1782292/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hettienne Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm1782292?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Vicki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0652663/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Patton Oswalt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm0652663?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matt Freehauf"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0714147/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elizabeth Reaser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm0714147?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Beth Slade"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0251708/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jill Eikenberry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm0251708?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hedda Gary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002148/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mary Beth Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm0002148?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1122158/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jenny Dare Paulin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm1122158?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Nipple Confusion Bassist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2106801/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Louisa Krause"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm2106801?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Front Desk Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3537795/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Brian McElhaney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1625346/characters/nm3537795?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Book Associate"}]}]}

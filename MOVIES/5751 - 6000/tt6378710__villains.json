The male lead was also great, as were the \"evil\" couple. The acting was so on point, and everyone was incredibly likeable, I think they made the film better than it otherwise would've been!\n\nWith that said, the plot is kinda wonky, and it's nothing you haven't seen 100x it's kinda the typical, \"outlaws stumble upon a dangerous abode\" type film.\n\nAs much as I'm not a comedy fan really, if this was a straight up comedy, it would've been AMAZING!! But...it's actually a crime/horror/drama/comedy. I believe it tried to be so much that it never really decided what to be. The beginning was light hearted and funny, the middle was a bit odd, but tries to be serious, and the final act it gets super dark out of no where.\n\nIt's one of those movies that you're glad you saw but probably won't watch again. I liked it, I wanted to love it.\n\nFind myself saying this fairly often, but this too would've been a fantastic TV show.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi78757657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I2Y2NhZGEtMjA0Mi00MjYwLWI0Y2QtM2I5MzgzYjc5NWFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I2Y2NhZGEtMjA0Mi00MjYwLWI0Y2QtM2I5MzgzYjc5NWFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Mickey and Jules are lovers on the run, headed southbound for a fresh start in the Sunshine State.

HOME delivers a haunting message but falls short of Contagious Humor", "reviewBody": "There are several lingering messages that HOME intends to deliver, and the speakers are aimed toward the younger ears: conquer your fears, be yourself, and as the soundtrack says \"Feel the light\" and bring it all back, pertaining to the lost glory waiting to be reclaimed, and the HOME they eventually, should be going back to.\n\nIt will be difficult to dismiss HOME's charm, specifically the colorful bubbly aliens called Boov, and equally endearing human characters, most of which voiced by popular actors like Jim Parsons, Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez. However, I'll be frank\u2014there's really nothing else so special about the movie. The plot is generic, I mean we've seen these alien-invades-earth, extraterrestrial befriends-human formula, over and over again, and it's kind of tiring already. I almost don't care about the plot anymore. Worse, in HOME, the humour didn't feel natural, either. I had these many moments when I needed to pause and ask myself \"was that supposed to be funny?\" while realizing the confused laughter gathering volume around me inside the theater. I just find everything the writers seemingly thought to be funny, aren't really as funny as they seem to imply. HOME is a colorful movie, I mean literally colorful, and you may find some of the characters lovable, but that's all. In general, HOME is a generic movie with flawed storyline, just another version of what we've already seen from its genre, only forced and unnatural and yields a mostly unpleasant outcome, bereft of contagious humor it utterly needs to overshadow its overly familiar material.If it's any consolation, the movie has beaufiful soundtrack.\n\nAnyway, you wouldn't blame the kids for finding this wonderful movie, it's for them after all. And this will serve as a reminder about how they should be and should act like while growing up.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Feel The Light (From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Home)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2222961433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTExMjQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc1NDM5NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTExMjQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc1NDM5NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Music video by Jennifer Lopez performing Feel The Light (From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Home).

Sure, it wasn't the comic -- and yes, the X-Men lineup stayed the same through all six seasons... but it handelled very well.  In some ways I wish the comic could have been more concise like the Animated Series was.  Some guest characters (Dazzler, my favourite X-Man, for one) weren't portrayed very well, especially in the explenation of their mutant powers, but it was very cool to see it all piece together.\n\nThe X-Men had it's share of continuity problems, however.  In season 1, for example, everything was loosely played off of the comics.  For instance, the X-Men did NOT know Warren Worthington III (Angel/Archangel).  Later on through the series, however, Angel is shown as an original X-Man.  Iceman was also later guest-starred as an original X-Man, and Polaris was shown as a former X-Man as well.  Other than that, though, the team is set as Wolverine, Rogue, Gambit, Cyclops, Storm, Jean Grey, Jubilee, Beast and Professor X.  Some great storylines were the Phoenix Saga, Dark Phoenix Saga and the Phalenx Covenant.\n\nJust about any X-Man you can think of was cameoed as well.  Except for Shadowcat that is.  Nightcrawler, Dazzler, Colossus, Havok, Wolfsbane, Cannonball, Longshot, and Rictor all stand fresh in my mind.  It was truly a great series -- and it was very sad to see it cancelled, as it brought something more substantial to television -- a dream, a goal.  Not talking sponges like you see on Nickelodeon.  This was and will continue to be one of the greatest cartoons that graced Saturday-morning television."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "X-Men: The Animated Series: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2741147929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3NWZiOTAtYmNhMi00NjM1LWIwOTktN2EyNjJjYmZiMWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3NWZiOTAtYmNhMi00NjM1LWIwOTktN2EyNjJjYmZiMWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for X-Men: Season 1 - Volume 1 & 2", "uploadDate": "2010-11-05T03:41:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0807649/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cedric Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0807649?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Professor Charles Xavier"}, {"url": "#", "name": "75 episodes, 1992-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0183750/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alyson Court"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0183750?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jubilation Lee"}, {"url": "#", "name": "74 episodes, 1992-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230064/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cal Dodd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0230064?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Logan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "74 episodes, 1992-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818049/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Norm Spencer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0818049?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cyclops"}, {"url": "#", "name": "73 episodes, 1992-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0780585/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alison Sealy-Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0780585?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ororo Munroe"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 1993-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0125579/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "George Buza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0125579?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Beast"}, {"url": "#", "name": "75 episodes, 1992-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0952801/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lenore Zann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0952801?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rogue"}, {"url": "#", "name": "74 episodes, 1992-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0228324/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Catherine Disher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0228324?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jean Grey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "73 episodes, 1992-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0693243/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Chris Potter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103584/characters/nm0693243?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gambit"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 1992-1997"}]}]}

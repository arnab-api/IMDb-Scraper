Terry tracks Jessie to Mexico...and immediately they fall in love. That's the first hour--the second hour becomes very convoluted with murders and double crosses all over the place.\n\nInteresting movie which is a semi-remake of \"Out of the Past\". In fact Jane Greer from the original plays the mother of her character here! The original was a strong, well-written film noir. This is not film noir--it's a combination romance/mystery/melodrama. Also Greer played a totally amoral woman in the original--here Ward isn't amoral, just misunderstood. Also Bridges is all pumped up and him and Ward work wonderfully together. Their frequent very R rated sex scenes really work. And it looks great--a portion of the film takes place in Mexico. Still there are definite problems here.\n\nOne character, Edie (Swoosie Kurtz) is introduced to provide some REAL clumsy exposition...and doesn't pop up again until a HOUR later. I had forgotten who she was! Alex Karras is incredibly bad in his role. The plot gets way too confused. And the movie isn't sure what it wants to be. It switches gears so much I thought I was gonna get whiplash! The best part of the movie--an incredible car race down Sunset Blvd. has NOTHING to do with anything in the movie! The acting is pretty good. Bridges (in one of his few commercial films) and Ward LOOK fantastic, have great bodies and are both good in their roles. Woods is, surprisingly, pretty wooden. Greer isn't in much but she IS very good. And Richard Widmark hams it up in his small role.\n\nAlso the film has a surprisingly somewhat downbeat ending. And there's a wonderful title song by Phil Collins (nominated for an Academy Award).\n\nA very interesting movie. I give it a 6. A sizable hit in its day--but that's because of the steamy sex scenes between Ward and Bridges.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Against All Odds", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2476185625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg3ODc5MmMtYzc2OC00OGI0LWI0NzEtNWFiZmFkNzIzZjhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg3ODc5MmMtYzc2OC00OGI0LWI0NzEtNWFiZmFkNzIzZjhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Against All Odds", "uploadDate": "2010-12-11T06:05:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001829/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rachel Ward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0001829?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jessie Wyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000249/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Woods"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0000249?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jake Wise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339452/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jane Greer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0339452?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Wyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002126/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dorian Harewood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0002126?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007210/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Saul Rubinek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0007210?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Steve Kirsch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0571853/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bill McKinney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0571853?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Head Coach"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0769075/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sam Scarber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0769075?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Assistant Coach"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0821347/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tamara Stafford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0821347?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kirsch's Girlfriend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000313/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeff Bridges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0000313?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Terry Brogan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0440090/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alex Karras"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0440090?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hank Sully"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001847/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Richard Widmark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0001847?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ben Caxton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001436/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Swoosie Kurtz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0001436?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Edie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179976/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pat Corley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0179976?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ed Phillips"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930006/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Allen Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0930006?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bob Soames"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0820519/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jon St. Elwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086859/characters/nm0820519?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ahmad Cooper"}]}]}

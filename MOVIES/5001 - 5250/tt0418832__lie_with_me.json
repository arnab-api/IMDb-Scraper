But the truth is this film falls short in its effort to examine sex addiction vs. the complexity of love and relationships. I suppose it is easy to dismiss this work as a well produced soft porn flick. It seems to want to be much more. The problem is the characters are not all that well developed. We do not know what the two principal characters find in each other that will transcend their heavy breathing. They say they love each other eventually, but who knows why? Frankly I have know idea what the lead female character has to offer in terms of substance. At least the male character is seen reading Steppenwolf and not the cliff notes version, either. So I guess we can deduce he has depth and intelligence. The female lead, however, seems to work in photo developing shop as a clerk. Yet she has quite a varied wardrobe which she somehow is able to afford. That's about it in terms of her personality and depth. But they do have attractive bods and I must guiltily admit I enjoyed that. If the sex scenes were edited out, the theater would be empty half way through any screening!!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1042071065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ0N2Q1MWYtMTUwYi00NDUzLTg0ZDEtYmQyNDAyMjQwNDY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ0N2Q1MWYtMTUwYi00NDUzLTg0ZDEtYmQyNDAyMjQwNDY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-01T13:50:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809049/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lauren Lee Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0809049?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Leila"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0788351/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Polly Shannon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0788351?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Victoria"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0264830/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael Facciolo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0264830?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Shy Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0925406/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ron White"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0925406?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0290475/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Don Francks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0290475?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joshua"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0157342/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Frank Chiesurin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0157342?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Joel - Groom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0869797/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Theresa Tova"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0869797?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Wedding Singer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0050156/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eric Balfour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0050156?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1534287/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mayko Nguyen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm1534287?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Victoria's Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0528367/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kate Lynch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0528367?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marla"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005138/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kristin Lehman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0005138?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rachel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0156739/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Richard Chevolleau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0156739?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Vigorous"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0513522/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nicola Lipman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0418832/characters/nm0513522?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rabbi"}]}]}

Clearly Neeson took a bit of persuading to play the role a third time, but it would appear that three factors persuaded him: first, he didn't want to do any travelling this time (so all the shooting -in both senses of the word - is in the overly-familiar Los Angeles where he goes \"down the rabbit hole\"); second, apparently he didn't think anyone should be taken this time (and the writers obeyed the injunction until near the end when they just couldn't resist any more); and third, he wanted the money.\n\nThis is a movie which divides the critics and the public: the former have been very condescending about it but the later enjoy Mills using his special skills again and again (and you can't really blame them). The bad guys here are (mostly) Russians who have terrible accents and awful clothes (especially underwear), but it is always a pleasure to see Forest Whitaker (an intelligent member of the LAPD who knows the significance of a warm bagel). The tag line in the advertisements for \"Taken 3\" is \"It ends here\" and I think that would be a sensible decision (although I wouldn't guarantee it)."}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2340859673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzIxMzE4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUzOTE4MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzIxMzE4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUzOTE4MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Ex-government operative Bryan Mills finds his life is shattered when he's falsely accused of a murder that hits close to home.

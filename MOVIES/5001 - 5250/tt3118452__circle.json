They quickly realise there is a way to 'vote off' your fellow circle dwellers in a very terminal way.\n\nIt is not long before prejudices and biases start to arise. Someone notices more black people are getting zapped than white people. Coincidence? Some of these biases are played out very professionally with flair and drama, others are handled a bit clumsily leading to some very cringey dialogue.\n\nThis film lives and dies by how much you are prepared to invest into it.\n\nIf you think about the scenario logically, then a lot of the choices people make seem rash and rather stupid.\n\nBut if you can put yourself in the characters shoes, and imagine that you - staring wide eyed down the barrel of a gun - are about to be killed over some scum bag rapist, in reality wouldn't you want that extra two minutes of life over them - just on principle?\n\nThis is where the film needs to draw you in. The acting, lighting, effects and sound are all good enough. However, some of the characters aren't, forcing some of the actors into a corner they have to ham their way out off. Then the spell starts to crack.\n\nIf you can remove all distractions and try to engage your emotions and blot out the signals coming from the rational parts of your brain then this is very good for Netflix fodder.\n\nI was fully prepared to have one of those stupid no answer endings. I was pleased to get a bit more than I expected.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Circle", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi861385497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q4MzA4YjEtNmJjMS00N2M1LWEwYWEtMjk4MDExNWFmMDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q4MzA4YjEtNmJjMS00N2M1LWEwYWEtMjk4MDExNWFmMDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Circle", "uploadDate": "2015-10-10T04:14:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6276713/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Allegra Masters"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm6276713?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "The Pregnant Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4081721/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ashley Key"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm4081721?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "The Young Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1648650/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bill Lewis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm1648650?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "The Oldest Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3782358/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cameron Cruz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm3782358?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1075323/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cesar Garcia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm1075323?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "The Tattooed Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0501738/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Daniel Lench"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm0501738?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "The Rich Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0718693/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Reivers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm0718693?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bruce"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6215332/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "DeMaris Gordon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm6215332?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Older Woman #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4401508/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aimee McKay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm4401508?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Beth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2608927/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Autumn Federici"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm2608927?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Woman #4"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1937968/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brent Stiefel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm1937968?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Young Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1334396/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Carter Jenkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm1334396?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "The College Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2941860/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mustafa Speaks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm2941860?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "The African American Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2868165/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Daniel Yelsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm2868165?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Shaun"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4157844/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "David Saucedo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3118452/characters/nm4157844?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "The Hispanic Man"}]}]}

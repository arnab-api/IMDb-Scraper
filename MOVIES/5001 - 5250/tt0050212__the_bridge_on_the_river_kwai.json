Based loosely on a real-life incident, it tells the story of an imprisoned British officer (Alec Guinness) who loses sight of his mission when forced to build a bridge for the Japanese that will enable the enemy to carry supplies by train through the jungle during World War II. Guinness plays the crisp British officer to perfection, brilliant in all of his scenes but especially in his confrontations with Sessue Hayakawa. William Holden has a pivotal role as one of the prisoners who escapes and enjoys his freedom for awhile before being asked to return with a small squadron to destroy the bridge. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne have colorful roles too and all are superb under David Lean's direction.\n\nThe jungle settings filmed in Ceylon add the necessary realism to the project and there is never a suspension of interest although the story runs well over two-and-a-half hours. The film builds to a tense and magnificent climax with an ending that seems to be deliberately ambiguous and thought provoking. Well worth watching, especially if shown in the restored letterbox version now being shown on TCM.\n\nSome of the best lines go to William Holden and he makes the most of a complex role--a mixture of cynicism and heroism in a character that ranks with his best anti-hero roles in films of the '50s. He brings as much conviction to his role as Alec Guinness does and deserved a Best Actor nomination that he did not get."}, "duration": "PT2H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai -- Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1900740633", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEzMTU0NTUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM0MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEzMTU0NTUwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDM0MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After settling his differences with a Japanese PoW camp commander, a British colonel co-operates to oversee his men's construction of a railway bridge for their captors - while oblivious to a plan by the Allies to destroy it.", "uploadDate": "2008-11-18T17:08:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000034/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William Holden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050212/characters/nm0000034?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Shears"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0370144/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jack Hawkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050212/characters/nm0370144?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Major Warden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0232019/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "James Donald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050212/characters/nm0232019?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Major Clipton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0603682/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Morell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050212/characters/nm0603682?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Colonel Green"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0101533/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Boxer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050212/characters/nm0101533?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Major Hughes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0329468/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Harold Goodwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050212/characters/nm0329468?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Baker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0645537/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Heihachir\u00f4 \u00d4kawa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050212/characters/nm0645537?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Captain Kanematsu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0149807/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "M.R.B.

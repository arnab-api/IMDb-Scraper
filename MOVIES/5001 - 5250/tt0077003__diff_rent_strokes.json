It's sad to watch the show, I wish I didn't know Dana Plato's problems because now I see how much she wanted her life to be like Kimberly Drummond. Conrad Bain was great as the father figure of the show. Of course, he was supposed to only be acting but I think he became a paternal figure to those youngsters. We went Mrs. Edna Garrett played by the wonderful Charlotte Rae who got her own show without all the drama of Different Strokes. She escaped it. I never approved of them dissing Dixie Carter for Mary Ann Mobley. I like them both in the role as the second Mrs. Drummond. Of course, there was the guest appearances of First Lady Nancy Reagan preaching against drugs. How little did we know the truth? Gary Coleman never escaped the image of the chubby cute kid on Different Strokes. Dana Plato who is gone to a better place never did get to experience the life of Kimberly Drummond except when she was on the set. I only wish Todd and Gary best for their future. I only wished that the off-screen drama was cut down for their sakes. I feel guilty getting laughs knowing that they went home and cried or faced abuse.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Diff'rent Strokes", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2913517337", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA5NzZmYWQtMTljNS00ZGU5LWE4YzYtM2VlNDliMmNhYjdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA5NzZmYWQtMTljNS00ZGU5LWE4YzYtM2VlNDliMmNhYjdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2019-09-10T17:13:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0047699/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Conrad Bain"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077003/characters/nm0047699?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Philip Drummond"}, {"url": "#", "name": "181 episodes, 1978-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004775/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Todd Bridges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077003/characters/nm0004775?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Willis Jackson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "178 episodes, 1978-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0146181/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mary Jo Catlett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077003/characters/nm0146181?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Pearl Gallagher"}, {"url": "#", "name": "81 episodes, 1982-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0171041/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gary Coleman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077003/characters/nm0171041?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Arnold Jackson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "181 episodes, 1978-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686818/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dana Plato"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077003/characters/nm0686818?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kimberly Drummond"}, {"url": "#", "name": "144 episodes, 1978-1986"}]}]}

Yes, it is based on a very true story, but this is not a typical biopic by any means. It's a \"light\" and easy movie, with some great performances by both leads, tight pacing, very nice writing and directing. No wonder that it was mentioned in an Comedy or Musical categories at Golden Globes and not in motion picture drama.\n\nOverall, this is true very well made biography drama about some painters and frauds. Won't going to spoil anything, just going to say that i was very surprised by the ending when i find out that this actually happen, well, probably not word by word but the outcome did happen actually how it was portrait in the movie. This is a very fine picture from legendary director Tim Burton, and safe to say that this is his best movie in years simply by not being \"a Tim Burton's\" movie as we know them. This small budget picture (in terms of other's T.Burton's flicks) actually is much more lovely and intimate then his recent works. I will go even so far and say that i haven't enjoy his movie so much since 1999's \"Sleepy Hollow\".", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2391846681", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc2NTE3ODM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg1ODQ3MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzc2NTE3ODM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg1ODQ3MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A drama centered on the awakening of the painter Margaret Keane, her phenomenal success in the 1950s, and the subsequent legal difficulties she had with her husband, who claimed credit for her works in the 1960s.", "uploadDate": "2014-09-21T07:14:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0010736/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Amy Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm0010736?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Margaret Keane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396812/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Danny Huston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm0396812?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dick Nolan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005403/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jason Schwartzman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm0005403?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ruben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0689237/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jon Polito"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm0689237?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Enrico Banducci"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4699715/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Madeleine Arthur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm4699715?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Older Jane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5947387/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Farryn VanHumbeck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm5947387?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2649203/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Elisabetta Fantone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm2649203?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Olivetti Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0152313/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Brent Chapman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm0152313?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Factory Boss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910607/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christoph Waltz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm0910607?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Walter Keane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1269983/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Krysten Ritter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm1269983?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dee-Ann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000654/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Terence Stamp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm0000654?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Canaday"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5865422/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Delaney Raye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm5865422?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Young Jane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0756839/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "James Saito"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm0756839?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Judge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1304907/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Guido Furlani"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm1304907?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dino Olivetti"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2979804/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Emily Maddison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1126590/characters/nm2979804?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "2nd Olivetti Girl"}]}]}

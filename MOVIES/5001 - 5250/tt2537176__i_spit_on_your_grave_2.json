Kinda slow for awhile but had more...spunk? The chick in the first movie was mostly dazed throughout everything until the end and before everything happened. This chick was alive and kicking throughout the whole movie. They added a twist and a completely new environment and they made it better in the sense that this was more of a revenge movie than the first where the first was pretty much just a rape movie because of how much they prolonged that damn moment. This movie is still disturbing with what happens to the chick BUT they didn't drag out the rape scene as long as the first. They actually shortened it by a lot, but it wasn't all one...long scene. It was like three where they showed the first one but was really short, second one only lasted seconds and the third wasn't even shown. This was more of a movie than the first, it didn't just feel like hardcore porn with barely any gore at the end. This felt like a real movie with pretty awesome revenge in it. This was a revenge movie with some rape, it can be disturbing to a lot of people but this wasn't like the first movie where the first movie felt like a rape movie with some revenge, this movie is a revenge movie with some rape.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi811313433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcxMjE0NTAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTMyODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcxMjE0NTAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTMyODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When Katie, a young woman trying to make it in the cutthroat world of modeling in New York, innocently accepts an offer to have new photos taken for her portfolio, the experience quickly turns into an unthinkable nightmare. \u00c2\u00adSeverely beaten, battered, bruised, and left for dead, she will have to tap into the darkest places of the human psyche to not only survive her ordeal, but to ultimately find the strength to exact her brutal revenge.", "uploadDate": "2013-09-19T12:02:35Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4728487/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jemma Dallender"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm4728487?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Katie Carter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3941379/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Yavor Baharov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm3941379?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Georgy Patov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1128766/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mary Stockley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm1128766?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ana Patov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4391958/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Aleksandar Aleksiev"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm4391958?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nicolay Patov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1653263/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michael Dixon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm1653263?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jayson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2817670/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dimo Alexiev"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm2817670?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bar Patron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5929535/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Krasimir Ortakchiev"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm5929535?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Policeman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0009424/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joe Absolom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm0009424?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ivan Patov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1197031/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "George Zlatarev"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm1197031?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Detective Kiril"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0670893/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Valentine Pelka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm0670893?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Father Dimov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0798872/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter Silverleaf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm0798872?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Valko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0056041/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kacey Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm0056041?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sharon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5929534/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ivan Ivanov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2537176/characters/nm5929534?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Pedestrian"}]}]}

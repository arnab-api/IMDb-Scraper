Unfortunately, time has not been kind to most of the movies I enjoyed during my youth. Imagine my surprise when I realized that not only was Return of the Living Dead every bit as much fun as when I first saw it, its actually improved!!\n\nFirst off, this is NOT a serious horror film. It is meant to be viewed as a comedy. Period. Once this perspective is taken, the horror elements are subtly introduced until, towards the end, we almost begin to feel a sense of disgust with ourselves for laughing at these people. I say ALMOST because a few silly decisions here and there (it would have been nice if the movie hadn't ended with recycled footage) turn what could have been the finest, and most disturbing, horror-comedy EVER MADE into a merely excellent one.\n\nHonestly, I challenge anyone to find a \"horror-comedy\" that delivers laughs, gore, some genuine scares, and combines it with what can only be called the finest acting I've ever seen in a horror-comedy (much less one from the 80's!). \n\nJames Karen, Clu Gulager, and Don Calfa absolutely STEAL this movie with their sidesplitting hysterics. Listen to the lines, note the deliveries. These guys are pros! Anyone who could THINK to call their acting \"wooden\" clearly knows nothing about the traps horror-comedies often fall into. Personally, I was thinking of the OD scene from Pulp Fiction the entire time. The absurdity mixed with tension was eerily similar. Tarantino (an admitted zombie-movie fan) must SURELY have seen this movie upon its initial release. Gulager in particular is just plain brilliant here, he's like a burned out shop teacher fighting zombies!! \n\nThis film is a hidden treasure in a genre all too often plagued by mediocrity.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Return of the Living Dead", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1684538649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQ2MDk5MDItZGNmNi00MmU5LTkwYmItYzFhYzM3MzEwYTZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQ2MDk5MDItZGNmNi00MmU5LTkwYmItYzFhYzM3MzEwYTZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this classic gore film follow up", "uploadDate": "2009-11-08T06:38:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0347656/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clu Gulager"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0347656?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Burt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0129883/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Don Calfa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0129883?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ernie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0709875/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Beverly Randolph"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0709875?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0791636/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jewel Shepard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0791636?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Casey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0669631/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Brian Peck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0669631?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Scuz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0893430/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mark Venturini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0893430?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Suicide"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179451/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cathleen Cordell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0179451?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Colonel's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0197826/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "James Dalesandro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0197826?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Paramedic #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0439170/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "James Karen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0439170?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Frank"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0558726/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Thom Mathews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0558726?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Freddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0679904/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Philbin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089907/characters/nm0679904?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chuck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0639200/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Miguel A.

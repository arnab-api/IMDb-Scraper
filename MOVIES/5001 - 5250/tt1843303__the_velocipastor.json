And yeah, in a way I was right. \"Velocipastor\" is ridiculous, it can't be taken seriously but I enjoyed every minute of it. It becomes clear very early that this movie means to be over-the-top. Much like classic horror comedies in the past, \"Full Moon High\", and \"Pandemonium\", this film knows it is absurd comedy and total cheese.\n\nBrendan Steere understands perfectly well the type of film he is making, and he was smart enough to gather a cast and crew who were in on the joke too. Some of the acting obviously falls short and it is a tightrope walk getting this story from scene one to the end without total collapse. Still, somehow, everything holds together with fun, entertaining craziness. And genuine laughs.\n\nThe effects are a blend of cheap CGI and low tech practical effects that fit inbetween gaming graphics and Adult Swim stuff. It would have been cool if more focus on creating a darker raptor had been taken, but still, it is a movie about a young priest turning into a dinosaur so the puppet/costume seems fitting. I have to add that \"Velocipastor\" has a cool soundtrack. And the whole music video montage in the center was entertaining as heck!\n\nOverall this isn't gonna be everyone's take on \"Velocipastor\". And I get it, a lot of people can only get into spoof horror if it has a big budget to sell the jokes. I enjoyed this film. It is silly, over-the-top, and entertaining. It doesn't take itself serious but everyone involved were serious about creating this tongue-in-cheek bit of satire.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H15M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Velocipastor", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi968997913", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQyMGQ2M2QtYWZhYi00OTJkLTk5YzYtZTk1OTA5YmQ1MTkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQyMGQ2M2QtYWZhYi00OTJkLTk5YzYtZTk1OTA5YmQ1MTkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2019-05-29T17:15:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4497612/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Greg Cohan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm4497612?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Doug Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8134169/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Janice Young"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm8134169?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Doug's Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6916005/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Claire Hsu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm6916005?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chinese Villager"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4219529/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alyssa Kempinski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm4219529?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carol"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7392511/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chase Schutter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm7392511?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Frankie's Heavy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3318325/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jesse Turits"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm3318325?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0901807/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Aurelio Voltaire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm0901807?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Altair"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4445500/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Pat Hroncich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm4445500?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Vietnam Soldier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8134170/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "George Schewnzer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm8134170?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Doug's Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3944814/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Daniel Steere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1843303/characters/nm3944814?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Father Stewart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2009087/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nicholas M.

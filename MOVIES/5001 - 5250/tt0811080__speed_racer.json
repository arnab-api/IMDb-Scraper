Although, this is still a different type of situation where one who was a big fan of the shows might be seriously critical of every little detail of the turned movie. I don't believe anyone who considers themselves truly knowledgeable about Tatsuo Yoshida's work can say that this was not represented well on the big screen. I'm now intrigued to go back and check out some episodes of Speed Racer.\n\nThat aside, as far as it being a movie and a work of art, I would give this movie high marks in both categories. For it being a movie, it was nice to see something so different as far as the approach to making it go. Also, having such an incredible cast makes it all the more intriguing. I don't see anyone else having portrayed any of these characters any better than the cast that was hired to do so.\n\nOn an artistic level, it is extremely hard to think of any other movie that comes close to being in the same league. I did not see The Matrix, but I would say that anyone who liked Sin City for its cinematography and graphic elements, would love Speed Racer. The use of bright photography that's added behind a green screen makes for a far more dramatic effect. \n\nTake the artistic elements of this movie, and put it together with the amazing cast (both looks and talent) and throw it together with a very different but coherent plot, and you've got yourself an extremely enjoyable movie that is definitely worth seeing. And seeing at the theater no less! My hats off to The Wachowski Brothers, and the rest of the cast and crew for putting together something different for a change.\n\nGO...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H15M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Speed Racer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1541472537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzYwMjYzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg5NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMzYwMjYzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg5NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Speed Racer - Sneak Peek", "uploadDate": "2008-04-17T19:02:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0386472/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emile Hirsch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm0386472?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Speed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000215/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Susan Sarandon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm0000215?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1736769/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ariel Winter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm1736769?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Young Trixie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0304694/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Giancarlo Ganziano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm0304694?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Everyman Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0295227/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harvey Friedman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm0295227?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harold Ledermann Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2500372/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Valery Tscheplanowa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm2500372?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Russian Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2995506/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Olivier Marlo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm2995506?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "French Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0348748/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kick Gurry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm0348748?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sparky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1675002/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nicholas Elia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm1675002?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Young Speed Racer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2371823/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Melissa Holroyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm2371823?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Speed's Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2187603/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Scott Porter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm2187603?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rex Racer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0273033/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter Fernandez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm0273033?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Local Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2692900/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sadao Ueda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm2692900?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Japanese Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2264982/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sami Loris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm2264982?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Italian Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0567632/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sean McDonagh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0811080/characters/nm0567632?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Celtic Announcer"}]}]}

I think of him as the Hands Christian Anderson of the 20th century. I didn't read all of Dahl's books but I read most of them. I've also seen most of the movies based on his books. Out of all the Roald Dahl books I read as child I would say that 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory' is my favorite but 'James And The Giant Peach' is my second favorite. \n\nThe reason why I would say these two books are my favorites is because they're both about children who live miserable lives until a magical experience changes their lives forever and both end up becoming the luckiest kids in the world. For Charlie, his life changes with a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but for James it's with a magical giant peach and group very friendly creatures.\n\nI first remember hearing about this movie back in late 1996 when it was released in America during the Christmas holidays and I was very excited about it, but unfortunately I had to wait until the Easter Holidays before this movie arrived in Australia. I certainly loved it. James's two horrible aunt's who are nothing except cruel and nasty. Are as horrible in the movie as they are in the book.\n\nI really loved the creatures from the peach which I remember (from the book) James describing them as \"The friendliest creatures in the world\". These creatures include Grasshopper, Earthworm, Centipede, Ladybug, Spider and Glowworm. My two favorite character's are Spider because her French accent made her a very smooth character and Centipede because of his sense of humor. \n\nI also liked the songs. My favorite was \"We're Family\" which the creatures use to express how much they love James. I certainly believe these creatures are the best family any child could have. So for anyone who loved Roald Dahl's books as a child, you must...must see this film!"}, "duration": "PT1H19M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001003/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Simon Callow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0001003?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Grasshopper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005137/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jane Leeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0005137?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ladybug"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0546816/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Miriam Margolyes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0546816?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aunt Sponge"}, {"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0546816?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Glowworm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000215/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Susan Sarandon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0000215?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Spider"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000667/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "David Thewlis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0000667?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Earthworm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0191688/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Steven Culp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0191688?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "James' Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0320752/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michael Girardin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0320752?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Reporter #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0398002/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kathryn Howell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0398002?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Woman in Bathrobe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000377/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Richard Dreyfuss"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0000377?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Centipede"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0525921/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joanna Lumley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0525921?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aunt Spiker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000592/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Pete Postlethwaite"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0000592?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Old Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0856057/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Paul Terry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116683/characters/nm0856057?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185367/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "J.

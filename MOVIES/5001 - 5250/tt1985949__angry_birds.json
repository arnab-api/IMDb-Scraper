While it doesn't have an overly intelligent script with a great moral story, it's beautifully animated, full of action, and some timely humor for all ages.\n\nAs with every animated film these days, bringing in world class voice talent is vitally important. People like Jason Sudeikis, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage add some credibility to the film, but unsurprisingly, they are what sold the film to me with its comedic charm. I think that's what this film is at its core, charming. It won't stick with you with grand themes like Zootopia, or catchy songs like Frozen, but it certainly made me laugh, and that's all I was hoping for.\n\nWith all of the well-timed adult humor, there was a good amount of unnecessary \"potty\" humor that felt more like the filmmakers were reaching for laughs. It's that type of desperate humor that overtakes the ridiculous joy out of seeing the birds angrily soar through the air from a slingshot toward pigs. And yes, to a certain extent you have to suspend your disbelief as to why birds simply can't fly in this film, but hey that's canon in the game.\n\nThe central story of Red, voiced by Sudeikis, and his overcoming of his anger was very predictable and doesn't offer anything new with storytelling. In fact, his arc is overtly similar to that of Shrek in the 2001 film. But I did enjoy seeing the dynamic of Red, Chuck, and Bomb as they attempt to uncover what it is the pigs are up to. The script tends to veer off at times in the middle act, as the trio travels to find the 'Mighty Eagle', voiced by Dinklage, but it picks up for a pleasantly heartwarming final act.\n\n+Surprisingly charming\n\n+Voice talent\n\n+Great animated action\n\n-Silly humor reaches for laughs\n\n-Unfocused middle act\n\n7.3/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3880498457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MzkwODM0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI0OTA2ODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MzkwODM0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI0OTA2ODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Find out why the birds are so angry.

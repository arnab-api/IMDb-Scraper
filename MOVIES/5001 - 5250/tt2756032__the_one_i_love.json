It makes a refreshing change to all the comic book, action, romance, vampire, tween-type films out there most of which I do enjoy but it's nice to watch something a bit different every now and then.\n\nWhat I enjoyed the most was the simple storyline and the wonderfully subtle acting. There was no convolution, there were no red herrings, the story progressed at a good pace and there were no over the top acting moments.\n\nThe gist of the story is that a couple are struggling in their marriage and they go away together for a nice weekend. Things quickly get strange after that. And that's all I'm going to say. Don't watch any trailers or read up on the storyline because films like this are really only enjoyable because of the mystery and atmosphere they build while watching. If you already know what's coming, it massively takes away from the enjoyment.\n\nThe entire story develops really well from beginning to middle to the end although whilst it was a good and fitting ending for the film, I have to say that I personally didn't like it. I'm not going to say anything to spoil it just that I didn't think the ending made sense after the speech the husband gave just a short while earlier. I wish they had spent more time figuring out a more unusual ending which would complement the film and leave a lasting impression. Also, I wish they had explained more about the therapist but overall the film is unique and interesting enough that these small flaws really don't matter.\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1809820697", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzMjUwNDI0NzZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDM5NTgwMjMx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAzMjUwNDI0NzZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDM5NTgwMjMx._V1_.jpg", "description": "On the brink of separation, Ethan and Sophie escape to a beautiful vacation house for a weekend getaway in an attempt to save their marriage.

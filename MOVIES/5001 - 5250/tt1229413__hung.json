All falls apart when he is injured and years later his dream girl wife, Jessica (Anne Heche), leaves him for a well-to-do dermatologist. Being a high school teacher and basketball coach does not pay very well. To make things even worse, his house catches on fire forcing him to live in a tent in his backyard and his twin teenage children move back with their overbearing mother. Ray goes to one of those scam \"get rich quick\" seminars and finds what he is also good at and the \"tool\" he has: sex and very...ahem...\"hung.\" He meets failed poet and corporate temp, Tanya Skaggle (Jane Adams), and enlists her as his pimp. The two embark on a business they hope will be successful in \"fulfilling\" women with happiness...will they successful? The show reflects on the subject of the economy very heavily and it's about time a show finally did. \"Hung\" is set in the backdrop of the economically beaten down but not out Detroit amidst layoffs and the public school system being federally underfunded. Thomas Jayne is perfect as Ray. He is your typical everyday average Joe trying going through economic hardship and through the profession of male prostitution he begins to have an understanding of women and of the direction of his own life. He continues to go on despite the ex-wife, his uptight next-door neighbor, and the economic hardships. Jane Adams is also wonderful in the part of passive aggressive but insightful Tanya. She doesn't face the same hardships as Ray, but she is lonely and sympathetic. Anne Heche is hysterical at times as Ray's overbearing ex-wife who is also going through hard times when her husband's finances take a huge a hit in the stock market. \"Hung\" is a show that reflects on the current economy and talks about the subject matter of male prostitution without making it look glamorous or fake.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer - Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi285785625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVlMzY4ODctYzQyMS00M2E4LTg4MmEtMWFkODBhZjRiZDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVlMzY4ODctYzQyMS00M2E4LTg4MmEtMWFkODBhZjRiZDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A former high school sports legend turned middle-aged high school basketball coach finds a way to benefit from his biggest asset.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-10T12:29:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005048/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Thomas Jane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm0005048?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ray Drecker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1470683/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charlie Saxton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm1470683?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Damon Drecker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000162/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anne Heche"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm0000162?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jessica Haxon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001344/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gregg Henry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm0001344?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mike"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416694/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lennie James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm0416694?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Charlie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "15 episodes, 2010-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011038/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jane Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm0011038?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tanya Skagle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1873154/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sianoa Smit-McPhee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm1873154?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Darby Drecker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0187460/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rebecca Creskoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm0187460?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lenore Bernard"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420646/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eddie Jemison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1229413/characters/nm0420646?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ronnie Haxon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}]}

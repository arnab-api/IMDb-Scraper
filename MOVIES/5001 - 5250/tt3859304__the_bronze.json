Check. Amazing dialogue that will make your grandma be tickled pink. Check. Amazing acting from under-appreciated actors. Check. The Bronze is about a former medalist who has to struggle with no longer being in the limelight. The opening scene in the film is by far the most interesting way to introduce a character I've seen in a long time.\n\nMelissa Rauch plays Hope. The extremely crass gymnast who doesn't care what she says but truly cares what people think of her. The first time I heard her voice I immediately thought of Bernadette Rostenkowski from Big Bang Theory, but then as she spoke more and she transformed into Hope.\n\nGary Cole plays another father figure. You might remember him from Reese Bobby from Talladega Nights or as Bill Lumbergh from Office Space. He's has a great character who just wants to make his daughter happy but at the same time be a responsible father. \n\nSebastian Stan plays Bucky Barns, no wait that's who he plays in Captain America, Stan plays Lance. Hope doesn't like most people, so when I say she hates Lance, it means something. He was a silver and gold medalist and took something very important to Hope when she was younger.\n\nHaley Lu Richardson is excellent as an up and coming gymnast. This was the first time I've really seen her act. That being said I'm excited to see her in M. Night Shyamalan's Split coming out in 2017.\n\nVerdict: I wouldn't recommend this to someone whose easily offended. If you've got the skin for it, I can't recommend this comedy more.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1005827353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MDAzMjA4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwMDU4NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0MDAzMjA4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwMDU4NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A foul-mouthed former gymnastics bronze medalist must fight for her local celebrity status when a new young athlete's star rises in town.", "uploadDate": "2016-01-29T09:04:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1851981/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Melissa Rauch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm1851981?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hope"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3042755/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thomas Middleditch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm3042755?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5198446/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cecily Strong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm5198446?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Janice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0710632/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dale Raoul"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm0710632?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Doris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1756301/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dominique Dawes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm1756301?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dominique Dawes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0595067/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dominique Moceanu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm0595067?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dominique Moceanu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0928795/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michael Shamus Wiles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm0928795?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Vet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2773139/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ellery Sprayberry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm2773139?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Teenage Hope"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0170550/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gary Cole"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm0170550?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659221/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sebastian Stan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm1659221?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lance"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4726634/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Haley Lu Richardson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm4726634?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maggie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0452929/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Craig Kilborn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm0452929?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Heath Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1189948/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Olga Korbut"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm1189948?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Olga Korbut"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3462502/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Barak Hardley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm3462502?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Matt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6165877/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Christine Abrahamsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3859304/characters/nm6165877?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Coach Pavleck"}]}]}

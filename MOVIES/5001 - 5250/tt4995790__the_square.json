First of all, you don't just watch The Square, you experience The Square. All 2 hours and 22 minutes of it, this movie is looong. The first half of the movie is brilliant and creative, in the second half you just get run over by Ruben \u00d6stlunds full force of artistic fury. Yes this movie is artsy, super artsy. If you are a fan of modern art then this is the movie for you, you will experience some of the most powerful artistic scenes in modern movie history. \n\nsecond, this movie does not give a f**k about your feelings, The Square is not created for the plot, the movie is created to deliver a message. When the movie is finished the employees of the cinema you will be visiting won't have to clean up leftover popcorn from the floor, they will be scraping your jaws from it.\n\nMy girlfriend was crying on the way home after watching this, not because it is heartbreaking but because she had trouble processing what she just had experienced.\n\nThere you have it, I hope that a few of you have second thoughts about watching the movie now and that the rest of you can't wait to get hold of a ticket!\n\nFred out", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3339172121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI1NDY2NmUtNGQxYi00M2NkLTkwZTAtYjM5NGEyNWY1ZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI1NDY2NmUtNGQxYi00M2NkLTkwZTAtYjM5NGEyNWY1ZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Christian is the respected curator of a contemporary art museum, a divorced but devoted father of two who drives an electric car and supports good causes.

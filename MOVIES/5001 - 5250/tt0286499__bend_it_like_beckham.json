Pinky (Archie Panjabi) works as a stewardess out of nearby Heathrow; but her day-to-day private life centers around family and family friends -- and, typical of many first generation immigrants, the immediate environment is like an appendage of the old country. Pinky's self worth is measured by only one goal; and it has been influenced culturally by her mother since infancy -- marry a good, upstanding Sikh and raise a family. Pinky's equally pretty, younger sister and our heroine, Jesminder \"Jess\" (Parminder Nagra), also lives in a world where nearly all human contact is Punjabi. Outside the house, in school or public places, she is a typical teenager -- except that she wants to be a professional football (\"soccer\") player(the film opens with Jess daydreaming that she takes a pass from Manchester United's soccer superstar, David \"Bend It Like BECKHAM,\" and scores on a header.\n\nJess is befriended by Juliette \"Jules\" Paxton (Keira Knightly), who invites her to join a local girls soccer team. Without fanfare, this is the film's key event that opens all doors and windows -- as Jules' family is drawn into the cultural mix -- wherein WE begin to understand the film's point of view.\n\nThe relationship between Jess and Jules is not presented as an example of cultural differences, but more as teenagers of one mind -- the two are more like each other at this age, than they are like their respective parents -- they enjoy boys (both have crush on the coach), shopping, sports, rock music and whatever young girls do and talk about. And despite spats, they are mutually supportive -- and good friends.\n\nThe girls' parents provide the film with definition and its better moments. Both fathers (Anupam Kher and Frank Harper) are supportive and permissive -- pushovers for their daughters -- whereas the mothers are pragmatic traditionalists, looking out for the best interests of their children. Mrs. Bhamra (Shahee Khan) is a mother hen often grousing the coop -- she wants both daughters married with respectable dowries (preferably matched high on the socio-economic ladder), and her grandchildren reared culturally as Sikhs, following the teachings of spiritual leader, Babaji. Mrs. Paxton (Juliette Stevenson) is no less involved in her daughter's future -- believing that women should be wives and keepers of the household. As mothers (my mother, yours, and all mothers), Mrs. Bhamra and Mrs. Paxton have more in common with each other, than they do with their respective, long standing, social-cultural groups. Ms. Stevenson has one of the film's better roles; and she executes it with humor and sensitivity.\n\nWe are grateful to Ms. Gurinder Chadha for this colorful and wonderfully outrageous look at a Sik family undergoing the pangs of westernization. A more universal point of view on the parents might have been appreciated, with sharper character studies, and maybe a camera or editing less prone to a sound bite style -- thereby adding a few minutes of film length. But none of these comments indicate a lack of enjoyment and respect for Ms. Chadha's achievement. The film includes some sexual content, including discussions on homosexuality, and some objectionable language; but all is within character, contextual, and acceptable viewing by pre-teens with parents present. And, if you have difficulty understanding the foreign language spoken in the UK, click on the English subtitles of your DVD.\n\nWe hardly notice the Sikh Temples rising in our communities, or Sikh students in Harvard Yard, or their parents' successes in business, including agriculture, medicine, and branches of engineering -- or Sikhs occupying seats of government in England. The transition and success of immigrant families is no longer unique -- and, it is better that it be commonplace and accepted as such. Although the fresh and exciting differences stirred into the melting pot are welcomed, we have learned that when parents and growing children are at issue -- we are one universal family. We watched the Bhamra children grow up as our neighbors; and we ate, drank, sang, and danced too much at Pinky's wedding. This film is not about how we are different -- it is about how we are alike. Mrs. Bhamra will have to occasionally forego her aloo gobi, chappatis, and dal, to join us -- her new friends -- at McDonalds to dine in style on a Big Mac, fries, and a coke."}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bend It Like Beckham", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4189651225", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjZmM2ExYjItZjM1Yi00MTk1LTg2NzEtMTM3ZjMxZWE1Y2Y4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjZmM2ExYjItZjM1Yi00MTk1LTg2NzEtMTM3ZjMxZWE1Y2Y4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Pre, \"Coming Soon\"", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:30:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0619406/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Parminder Nagra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0619406?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001667/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jonathan Rhys Meyers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0001667?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0659544/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Archie Panjabi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0659544?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Pinky Bhamra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0363857/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Frank Harper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0363857?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alan Paxton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0451319/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Shaheen Khan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0451319?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mrs. Bhamra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1001884/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Pooja Shah"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm1001884?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Meena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0435755/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Preeya Kalidas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0435755?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Monica"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1163800/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Saraj Chaudhry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm1163800?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sonny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461136/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Keira Knightley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0461136?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jules"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0451600/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anupam Kher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0451600?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mr. Bhamra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0507750/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Shaznay Lewis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0507750?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0828980/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Juliet Stevenson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0828980?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Paula Paxton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0151189/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ameet Chana"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0151189?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tony"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1002157/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Paven Virk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm1002157?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bubbly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267688/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Trey Farley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0286499/characters/nm0267688?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Taz"}]}]}

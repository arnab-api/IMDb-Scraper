I'd never seen a movie with The Rock before or even watched any wrestling so I was kind of dubious as to whether or not he would be any good. \n\nIn fact he was a great actor, full of personality and charisma, willing to make fun of himself and was great with the action. The Rock is definitely the next Arnie. Vin (Donald Duck) Diesel is the next Jean Claude Van Damme.\n\nSeann William Scott was also pretty funny in a rare NOT Stifler performance. As an actor he does have genuine talent that's usually wasted in low-brow teen sex comedies. \n\nThe Rundown is a sort of Indiana Jones-lite movie. The Rock plays a bounty hunter/chef who is sent to track down Seann William Scott south of the border. Against his will The Rock ends up on a trek through the depths of the Mexican jungle looking for some ancient artefact. Unoriginal it may be but director Peter Berg keeps it moving with plenty of stunts, action and laughs. Christopher Walken's villain is a bit of a cardboard cut-out but how evil are you allowed to be in a PG-13?\n\nI look forward to the next movie starring The Rock. With talks of a third Conan movie I can only imagine him being the best choice. And keep a lookout for Arnie in the nightclub at the very beginning. 'Have fun' is his only line. And fun The Rock will certainly have as the next BIG action hero.\n\nKeep a lookout for Scottish actor Ewan Bremner (a zillion times the 'star' Ewan MacGregor is) in a funny role as a slob pilot.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Rundown", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2038871577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MDY4Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg4MTUyMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MDY4Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg4MTUyMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Rundown", "uploadDate": "2016-10-07T02:38:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0425005/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dwayne Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327850/characters/nm0425005?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Beck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206257/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rosario Dawson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327850/characters/nm0206257?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mariana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001971/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ewen Bremner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327850/characters/nm0001971?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Declan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0524747/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "William Lucking"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327850/characters/nm0524747?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Walker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1151714/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stuart F.

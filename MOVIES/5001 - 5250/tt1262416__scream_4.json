This was a great movie, especially for fans of the original. It makes up for the awfulness of Scream 3, and includes many very talented new actors and actresses. I was very surprised to walk into the screening theater and see a fantastic horror film. As soon as the Dimension logo appeared on screen, my heart began to race. The opening scene was brutal and hilarious, and it was great to see all of the original characters back on the screen again. I found the Wes Craven cameo, and was laughing as I spotted it out. This movie was great to watch, even though there were some things that needed to be fixed. Very minor problems though. There were some parts in the dialogue that seemed unrealistic (Ehren Kruger re-writes), but it wasn't a huge deal. Also, the ending was kinda long, but it was also very suspenseful. I would most definitely recommend this to a friend in search of a good horror movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Scream 4: TV Spot \"Reveal\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1138597145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1ODYwNjAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI3NzEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1ODYwNjAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI3NzEzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the new TV spot \"Reveal\" for the thriller Scream 4.", "uploadDate": "2011-04-09T11:54:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1423955/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lucy Hale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm1423955?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sherrie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1501624/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Shenae Grimes-Beech"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm1501624?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Trudie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001593/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anna Paquin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0001593?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rachel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1631435/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Aimee Teegarden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm1631435?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jenny Randall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000117/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Neve Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0000117?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sidney Prescott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000274/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David Arquette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0000274?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dewey Riley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0659363/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hayden Panettiere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0659363?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kirby Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3404718/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Marielle Jaffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm3404718?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Olivia Morris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413996/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Roger Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0413996?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "The Voice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267258/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dane Farwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0267258?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ghostface"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068338/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kristen Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0068338?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chloe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1429380/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Britt Robertson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm1429380?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Marnie Cooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1555340/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alison Brie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm1555340?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rebecca Walters"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001073/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Courteney Cox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0001073?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gale Weathers-Riley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0731075/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Emma Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1262416/characters/nm0731075?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jill Roberts"}]}]}

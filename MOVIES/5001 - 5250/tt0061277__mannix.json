Desilu had been riding high with Mission Impossible and Star Trek and of course the Lucy Show, but as Desilu was folding into Paramount, CBS bought this show and Desilu produced a superb drama. Bruce Geller who produced Mission Impossible at Desilu was given the task by Herbert Solow the dynamic Executive Vice President of Desilu to produce this hit TV show. Mannix stands as the very last of the great shows Desilu produced among them The Untouchables, Star Trek, Mission Impossible, and great comedies such as I Love Lucy, Our Miss Brooks and of course The Lucy Show. It was wonderful as a fan of Desilu to see so much quality programming from a great little studio run by Lucille Ball."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1595784729", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDczOTI2MjYtMGYwMy00YjJhLWFmYjItZWJmNTNmOTVkMjlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDczOTI2MjYtMGYwMy00YjJhLWFmYjItZWJmNTNmOTVkMjlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Mannix worked originally for Wickersham at Intertect and then struck out on his own, assisted by Peggy Fair (whose cop-husband had been killed) and Police Department contact Tobias.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-02T11:17:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0175528/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mike Connors"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061277/characters/nm0175528?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Joe Mannix"}, {"url": "#", "name": "194 episodes, 1967-1975"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0939959/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ward Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061277/characters/nm0939959?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lt.

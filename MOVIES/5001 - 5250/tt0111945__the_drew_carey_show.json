Drew Carey rocks!", "reviewBody": "My friend admitted he liked this show a lot because at the time it had something different from other sitcoms- a setting not in New York. Also, the story pretty much revolves around Drew Carey- the others are always there to provide comic relief. Oswald (Diedrich Bader), which I just realized is a name rearrangement of the guy who shot Kennedy, and Lewis (Ryan Stiles) are like two dogs that accompany Drew to his misadventures; faithful, kinda slow, and pee a lot.\n\nThe Drew Carey show is down-to-earth and humorously self-deprecating. Drew Carey, the overweight man in thick glasses, works a dead-end job surrounded by those who work hard to make him suffer. The way Drew and Mimi (Kathy Kinney) sling insults and pranks at each other day after day provides one of those greatest moments of real life living. Most shows tend to avoid the workplace even though it consumes almost one-third of your life (except some like Just Shoot Me or Murphy Brown) You wonder how coworkers around you manage to stay alive. Example- Drew to Mimi- \"What's with this pile of crap? And what's with all the junk on its desk?\" Oswald and Lewis are there mainly as Stooges to make Drew's life more exciting. This trio can make a list of dirty jokes and all three are bachelors on the journey to a good time. Only Drew is slightly more moralistic, but Lewis and Oswald are there to cheer him up and tell him that he blew it on a chance to totally get some. Just like true chums.\n\nThe show has some similarities to Seinfeld, but less Jewish and more beer-drinking by all cast members. This sitcom is not afraid to deviate from the standard situational episodes once in a while, like the \"Emmy-performance\" or the \"live\" show. But, better than most shows, is the believability of the characters. They don't mind sitting around drinking. The characters sling insults at each other and shake it off so that they can drink Buzz Beer.\n\nI like this show more because of its constant slew of great insults and misfortunes, while still giving the characters that down-to-earth feel. You don't always get what you want, and that's what Carey gets to learn when surrounded by an awesomely quirky cast."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2102640153", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxMzlkYTktOWM5YS00NzZhLWEwYTctOWEyMWFiYzkyMDgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxMzlkYTktOWM5YS00NzZhLWEwYTctOWEyMWFiYzkyMDgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-10T17:36:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004804/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Drew Carey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111945/characters/nm0004804?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Drew Carey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "233 episodes, 1995-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0455745/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kathy Kinney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111945/characters/nm0455745?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mimi Bobeck Carey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "233 episodes, 1995-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272401/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Craig Ferguson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111945/characters/nm0272401?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nigel Wick"}, {"url": "#", "name": "185 episodes, 1996-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0046033/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Diedrich Bader"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111945/characters/nm0046033?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Oswald Lee Harvey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "233 episodes, 1995-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0830198/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ryan Stiles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111945/characters/nm0830198?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lewis Kiniski"}, {"url": "#", "name": "232 episodes, 1995-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0588096/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Christa Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0111945/characters/nm0588096?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kate O'Brien"}, {"url": "#", "name": "183 episodes, 1995-2004"}]}]}

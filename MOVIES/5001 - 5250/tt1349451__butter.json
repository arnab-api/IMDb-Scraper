As it was very late Mrs. Shullivan unknowingly has become the true barometer of how I will eventually rate this film. You see, if she falls asleep early in the film then it must be a dud. If she stays up until the films' end credits then the film must be entertaining sufficiently enough to keep Mrs. Shullivan from her comfortable bed and pillow. (I will give you the resulting film score at the end of my review.)\n\nJennifer Garner and Ty Burrell play a married couple named Laura and Bob Pickler who live a very privileged lifestyle. They have a beautiful up scale style home and they are raising a college aged daughter named Kaitlin (played by Ashley Greene) who dislikes her own parents as they put their silly butter sculpture contests ahead of any other family values. Kaitlin is at that rebellious age and her hormones and excitement get the best of her when she finds out that the mysterious hot lady at their front door who wants to talk to her dad, Bob Pickler, is actually a stripper named Brooke (played by Olivia Wilde) and Brooke is demanding a $600 payment from her dad for services recently rendered.\n\nWhile Laura and Bob Pickler are busily engaged with their hands in their current butter sculpture, their daughter is also busily engaged with her tongue in Brooke the stripper's mouth, learning how to climax properly. Of course this scene has nothing to do with the butter competition but subconsciously, we as parents may get a chuckle out of the scene but may also choose to ask our pwn teenage children what they have been up to lately.\n\nThe butter carving competition heats up and comes down to the championship battle between Laura Pickler and a cute little 10 year old foster child named Destiny. Destiny is played by the very seasoned child actress named Yara Shahidi, most recently known for playing the oldest teenage daughter Zoey Johnson on the hit comedy TV series Black-ish. Now Destiny has found the one thing that she is extremely good at and that is sculpturing butter. \n\nSo Mrs. Shullivan was entertained enough such that she stayed up and watched the entire film without falling asleep on the couch or worse yet, abruptly getting up and shuffling off to bed. No Mrs. Shullivan stayed up and when the film ended we agreed that we enjoyed the film but it was the film that ended rather abruptly and not Mrs. Shullivan. I personally felt that the ending came too soon and if I were attempting to draw a parallel I would have to say that I thought I purchased butter, the film only delivered me the lower staple of margarine.\n\nI give the film Butter a decent 6 out of 10 rating. The film is certainly targeted for adults who enjoy a bit of raunchiness with their butter. Children under the age of sixteen (16) should not be watching Butter as the language and some sexually inferred scenes are a bit too raunchy for a younger audience.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2889852185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcxMTM4NTA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY0MjEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcxMTM4NTA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY0MjEyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In small-town Iowa, an adopted girl discovers her talent for butter carving and finds herself pitted against an ambitious local woman in their town's annual contest.", "uploadDate": "2012-08-25T07:34:52Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004950/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jennifer Garner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm0004950?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Laura Pickler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0770845/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Garrett Schenck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm0770845?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Orval Flanagan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3600195/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jason Yudoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm3600195?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1740138/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Judy Leavell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm1740138?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Helen Flanagan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2435275/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Deana Ricks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm2435275?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Butter Fan's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1225114/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kelly Tippens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm1225114?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Moore"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5664036/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeanne Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm5664036?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mrs. Gunderson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2296757/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Christine Scheller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm2296757?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Transitional Home Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0123092/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ty Burrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm0123092?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bob Pickler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1102891/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kristen Schaal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm1102891?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carol Ann Stevenson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809613/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Phyllis Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm0809613?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nancy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0159609/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joe Chrest"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm0159609?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Butter Fan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2780578/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Yara Shahidi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm2780578?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Destiny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2281637/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dodie Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm2281637?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "June Carmichael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1799424/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Cindy Creekmore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1349451/characters/nm1799424?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Danielle Mattingly"}]}]}

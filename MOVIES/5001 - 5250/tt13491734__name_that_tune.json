I admit that Randy Jackson and his \"dawg\" have always bugged me. I loved Name That Tune as a child and we occasionally watch old episodes on YouTube. I know the format and have always enjoyed the game. A modern take with modern music? I'm in!\n\nJane's jokes were lame and the audiences overzealous laughter started to ruin it from the first moment. The band, one singer was decent enough, the rest were just not that great. I'd rather have not had the singers and simply had Jackson playing on the piano.\n\nThe clues are far too easy. Naming a song that is something you might say to your cab driver on Sunday. I could guess that song with no notes. To me, that ruined it.\n\nThe final round with the seven songs to guess within a set time was better. There were at least a few challenges in there. I also appreciated that the decades were mixed, so 80s being my decade where instantly recognizable while some of the most recent songs were harder for me.\n\nOverall though, the jokes, the focus on Krakowski's body with the tight, low cut, well above the knee dresses, and lack of memorable interactions between the host, bandleader, and contestants made me simply not care. Maybe if there was less talking and more game playing I'd have liked it better.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Name That Tune: What Is It All About?", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1225244953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMDg4NzMtMDliOC00ZjYzLTg1NGUtMzI0NDkyMDFlNzM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMDg4NzMtMDliOC00ZjYzLTg1NGUtMzI0NDkyMDFlNzM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Name That Tune: What Is It All About?", "uploadDate": "2021-01-07T13:02:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1193098/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Randy Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt13491734/characters/nm1193098?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Band Leader"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005105/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jane Krakowski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt13491734/characters/nm0005105?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2021"}]}]}

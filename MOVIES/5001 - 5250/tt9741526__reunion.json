Movie was slow for 1st hour and started to feel like torture. But I wanted some answers to all the weird poop they showed us, strange images, creepy old drawings, flashbacks, weird black ooze, no packing skills at all. The last 25 minutes is probably best part of movie, but still left me with a ton of questions about that room and its contents. How was the mom planning to pack that hot mess up??? :o I felt sorry for Cara and then Ellie, but the parents can go straight to Hell for all I care. The 2 female leads did give great performances, but the movie is just all over the place, too many questions unanswered, and I wanted to hear the lecture they kept running in the background, but I may have well been listening to Charlie Brown's teacher because it was impossible to get more than a snippet or two of what was being said. I'm sure there are people who enjoy this style of story telling, but Most people won't. I have to say Pass on this or if you watch and get bored about 30 mins in to it, fast forward to last 25 mins and you will get as much information as watching the whole thing. If it was arranged differently, it might have been kinda good. I gave it 2 stars for the female leads and 2 stars for the cool old house and that ROOM! :O", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4233937177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGY4MmZjMmItMGNkZS00NWRmLWIxNmYtZmYzYzU4NTQwMTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGY4MmZjMmItMGNkZS00NWRmLWIxNmYtZmYzYzU4NTQwMTk4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-02-10T14:19:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000566/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Julia Ormond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9741526/characters/nm0000566?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ivy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0045324/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Bach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9741526/characters/nm0045324?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1959207/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cohen Holloway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9741526/characters/nm1959207?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11130411/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gina Laverty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9741526/characters/nm11130411?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Young Ellie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5109175/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Emma Draper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9741526/characters/nm5109175?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ellie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0116426/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nancy Brunning"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9741526/characters/nm0116426?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kathy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10408607/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ava Keane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9741526/characters/nm10408607?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cara"}]}]}

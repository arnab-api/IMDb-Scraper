It's hard to have perspective when there is no measure, so with that said I can say safely without a shadow of doubt in my mind that Star Trek II: Wrath of Kahn is the greatest of the Star Trek Movies ever made, period. There has never been a movie prior or post this movie that has engaged, excited or enthralled a Treker. If you want to know why exactly, read my review on it.\n\nNow during this era of Star Trek movies they never muddled with the plot killer dimension, time, except one, Star Trek IV: Return Home. All of the other movies where, how would 'Q' put it, linear. Honestly, anything that has a plot where someone goes back into time and tries to change it or prevents its change, well lets say, it kills the plot by putting a plot hole the size of a\u0085black hole. \n\nI was never a real fan of the time travel as a script concept simply because if it was possible at all, everybody and anybody would eventually try to go back in time and change things to a more favorable outcome for themselves. Basically if you were able to go back in time, wouldn't you pick the winning lottery ticket numbers? So if you can do that why can't I? The next thing you know, you've got a million winning tickets. Star Trek: Nemesis, gets one gold star for having a plot that does not change time on a clock.\n\nIn fact it's pretty good. There are flaws and incongruities especially in regards to the Generations episodes and there is no justification for some of the oversights, but the movie shines where it should. A real attempt was made to develop the villains character Shinzon of Remus, Picard's clone. He isn't just a villain, he is a Picard, an alternate version.\n\nSo what's new? Picard embodies the perfect Starfleet officer. But take that uniform off and replace it with tattered clothes and remove that individual form his starship and place him in the deep recesses of a sunless world mined by slaves, tortured by Romulans and \u0085you get the picture.\n\nWhat I think people missed in this movie was the big question, are Picard and the clone so different. Shinzon even asks Picard that in the movie. Could Picard have changed or convinced the clone had he had more time? Could the original Picard in a similar situation become evil? Either way, it is the human element and conflict within each of the Picard's and is what will intrigue an audience and is what I especially liked about this movie.\n\nThe special effects are good and really enhance a situation not nearly explored enough in Star Trek, the tactics of starship combat. This and only a few other instances has there been such an emphasis on strategy and tactics in starship combat.\n\nJean-Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart) and his clone Shinzon of Remus (Tom Hardy) are both at the top of their game and fluently exercise their Shakespearean acting talents. Especially Hardy, who convinces us that he is Picard's clone, and then convinces us he's nothing like Picard. The Enterprise crew is at their best and Stuart Baird's direction gave Nemesis a movie like feeling rather than TV mini-movie feeling.\n\nIn closing, who wants to be an ensign when you can be a captain? In the end Trekers have to realize that Star Trek and its stories are about its captain. It is the captain who gets to say those cool lines like: 'Energize', and 'Fire', 'Divert Warp Power' 'Meet me in my ready room' and Picard's trademark lines 'Make it so!'.\n\nA must see for Sci-Fi buffs and open-minded Trekers."}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Star Trek: Nemesis", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3498705177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEzYzU0NjktNWM1Yy00Y2EwLWJmZDQtZTI4MzgzNDFjNzE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEzYzU0NjktNWM1Yy00Y2EwLWJmZDQtZTI4MzgzNDFjNzE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:15:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001772/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Patrick Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0001772?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jean-Luc Picard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000653/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brent Spiner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000653?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Data"}, {"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000653?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "B-4"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000373/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael Dorn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000373?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Worf"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000533/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gates McFadden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000533?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Beverly Crusher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000579/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ron Perlman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000579?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Viceroy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000539/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dina Meyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000539?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Commander Donatra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0197638/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Alan Dale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0197638?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Praetor Hiren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0654212/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Owen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0654212?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Helm Officer Branson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000408/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jonathan Frakes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000408?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "William Riker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000996/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "LeVar Burton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000996?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Geordi La Forge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000642/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marina Sirtis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0000642?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Deanna Troi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0362766/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tom Hardy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0362766?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Shinzon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0168213/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shannon Cochran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0168213?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Senator Tal'aura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0161980/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jude Ciccolella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm0161980?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Commander Suran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1295834/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John Berg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0253754/characters/nm1295834?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Senator"}]}]}

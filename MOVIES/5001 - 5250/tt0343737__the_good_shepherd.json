An all-star cast and an intriguing story isn't all that this movie has. It has some great performances from both Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie that are likely to get some award nominations.\n\nI won't give any spoilers, I'll just give my background and overall opinion. When I saw the commercials, I thought it seemed interesting, but not interesting enough to get me out of my seat right now to go see it. It just didn't seem to have anything totally different than other movies, other than the combination of actors. Since I just got to see it anyway, I realized that it's one of those movies that ends up being better than you think it would be.\n\nMatt Damon, as always, plays a good serious guy who's smart, savvy, and dedicated to his job. It kind of reminded me of his characters in The Departed and the Bourne Identity, except it's in a different situation and setting. His performance in this role was very fitting and believable.\n\nAngelina Jolie surprisingly worked well with this role. In the commercials I thought she was a little too wild compared to Matt Damon's calm character, but she really brought out the emotion of a wife who felt shut out and didn't have a complete relationship with and understanding of her husband.\n\nRobert DeNiro of course was great. It was a nicely added touch to an already good movie.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say it's as factual as the History Channel, I think the subject of the movie does put good insight on the history of the CIA. I think people who are into government/politics and history would like the storyline. It does focus quite a bit on his family relationship and how it is affected by his job in the CIA, and I'm sure any couple who has been in a similar situation would understand it.\n\nOverall, the movie was better than I thought and I would recommend it to movie-goers, especially those who like suspense and any of the main characters.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H47M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000354/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt Damon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0000354?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Edward Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000285/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alec Baldwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0000285?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sam Murach"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001082/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Billy Crudup"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0001082?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Arch Cummings"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001158/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Keir Dullea"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0001158?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Senator John Russell, Sr."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0311476/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Martina Gedeck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0311476?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hanna Schiller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000459/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Timothy Hutton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0000459?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Thomas Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532683/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gabriel Macht"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0532683?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Russell, Jr."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000582/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Joe Pesci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0000582?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Joseph Palmi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001401/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Angelina Jolie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0001401?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Margaret 'Clover' Russell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0087109/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tammy Blanchard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0087109?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Laura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000134/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Robert De Niro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0000134?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bill Sullivan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002091/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Michael Gambon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0002091?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Fredericks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000458/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "William Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0000458?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Philip Allen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411980/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mark Ivanir"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm0411980?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Valentin Mironov #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1195855/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lee Pace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0343737/characters/nm1195855?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Richard Hayes"}]}]}

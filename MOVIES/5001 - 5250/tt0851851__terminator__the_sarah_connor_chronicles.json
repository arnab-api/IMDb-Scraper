It took a little time to adjust to the new actors playing these characters that i grew up with, just as it did for Terminator 3's John Connor. But at least that movie had Arnold in it right?? So what about the Terminators in this series? I found the bad Terminator quite menacing, it had the unstoppable feeling that the original movie gave. My only gripe with this guy is that the Terminator seemed to have an attitude. Like a kid who thinks he's hard....perhaps just my opinion.\n\nAnd as for John's new protector, I was a little shocked by her appearance. However I am not slagging her performance, in fact the opposite. She remained so emotionless throughout the episode, she's very attractive (no doubt that will help John trust her) but there is also something quite menacing about her....\n\nI guess we will have to wait and see....If you haven't seen the Sarah Connor Chronicles yet because you were sceptical as I was, give it a try. Just remember it's not a $200 million movie and it's more than likely you'll enjoy it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1542062361", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxMWI4MTgtMWJlYy00OTVhLTk2M2EtYWI1ODYzZTU3NTkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxMWI4MTgtMWJlYy00OTVhLTk2M2EtYWI1ODYzZTU3NTkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-06-30T03:38:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372176/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lena Headey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0851851/characters/nm0372176?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sarah Connor"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2008-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1132359/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Summer Glau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0851851/characters/nm1132359?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cameron Phillips"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2008-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004977/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brian Austin Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0851851/characters/nm0004977?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Derek Reese"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2008-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1276549/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Shirley Manson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0851851/characters/nm1276549?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Catherine Weaver"}, {"url": "#", "name": "17 episodes, 2008-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0215281/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Thomas Dekker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0851851/characters/nm0215281?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Connor"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2008-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429114/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard T.

In the film, he truly captures the idea that Jerry is a man forced down a road of violence by things that he cannot control. He is a unique serial killer in that he so wants normalcy, companionship and happiness. The joy in Reynolds' eyes when he is shown human kindness by other co- workers (Gemma Arterton & Anna Kendrick) is as key to this performance as the insanity that other actors would have focused on and turned into scenery chewing. Reynolds uses his natural charm to great effect here. The voices has some similarities with American Psycho with Christian Bale, as both characters have some similar traits. Or an older film which has been somewhat forgotten is the Cable Guy starring Jim Carrey. Overall, the Voices is not a film for everyone and can be easily seen as unstable for those expecting different results. It is entertaining throughout and offers some twists.\n\n==================================================================== ====================================================================\n\nAs a rewatch 08/09/17' The Voices is a highly entertaining dark comedy. The film isn't meant to be taken as serious as some people are criticizing it, as we realize what is being shown is within the range of the character, which is why the film is titled \"The Voices\". By the end, everything makes more sense as there are some clues. As a further rewatch 11.26.20' enjoyed this film more so as one payed closer attention to detail and found more subtle clues and hints. Would enjoy Ryan Reynolds to do more dark comedy type films like this in the future. Still a hidden gem.

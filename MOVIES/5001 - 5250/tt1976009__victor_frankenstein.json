From last year's I, Frankenstein to Van Helsing who only has it as subplot, all have met mediocre fate. Now armed with robust acting power and visual that oozes Victorian era, also a bit or horror and action attached somewhere, another rendition shares the same exact fate; cinematic tediousness.\n\nA slight modification to the narrative is made, just like Sherlock the movie is narrated from the sidekick's perspective, in this case Igor's (Daniel Radcliffe). Aside from that, there's barely anything new that hasn't been done in similar or better fashion. To its credit, it's not utterly terrible in term of presentation, in fact the visual is rather nice. It's quaintly dark and electric version of last decade metropolis, Tesla would approve.\n\nJames McAvoy as the titular Viktor really tries hard on establishing the character. Given the stale material, he still manages to squeeze some emotional scenes as well as a good chemistry with Radcliffe in a bromantic kind of way. Andrew Scott from Moriarty fame, now plays the role of Inspector Turpin. He's the polar opposite of Viktor, conservative yet equally clever and ambitious.\n\nUnfortunately, the far too familiar plot fails to produce any thrill, the strong acting prowess ends up rehearsing the same routine of mad scientist's banter. There's screaming, philosophical argument, faux science and slight mental abuse by the two leads. It's a lot of noise of little dramatic effect. Not that the script is bad in any way, it has occasional witty lines although any hint of humor or charm is muffled by the overly melancholy tone.\n\nAt some points, the movie tries to dabble in horror, action and even romance subplot. The atmosphere is already primed for thriller, but the shocking abomination is ironically timid and unmemorable. Action consists of a few scenes of slow motions repetition. Despite the production offering distractions, the main story line is very straightforward and streamlined, and sadly also predictable.\n\nFor all the star and flair, though they might be mildly amusing, the end product is a medium so lacking of life.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3739136793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Nzc3NjY0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMzOTg1NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4Nzc3NjY0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMzOTg1NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official trailer for Victor Frankenstein.", "uploadDate": "2015-08-19T04:51:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0705356/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Daniel Radcliffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm0705356?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Igor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0916037/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bronson Webb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm0916037?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rafferty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0990547/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Daniel Mays"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm0990547?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Barnaby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1131014/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Robin Pearce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm1131014?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Baron Bomine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4360085/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Callum Turner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm4360085?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alistair"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4846857/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Eve Ponsonby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm4846857?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Orderly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1154764/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Louise Brealey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm1154764?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sexy Society Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3456865/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Freddie Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm3456865?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Finnegan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3726887/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jessica Brown Findlay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm3726887?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lorelei"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0564215/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James McAvoy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm0564215?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Victor Frankenstein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1872855/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Spencer Wilding"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm1872855?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nathaniel"}, {"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm1872855?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Prometheus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0778831/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Andrew Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm0778831?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Inspector Turpin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0098414/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Di Botcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm0098414?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Older Nun"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1652308/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Will Keen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm1652308?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Surgeon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2348787/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nicola Sloane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1976009/characters/nm2348787?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Housekeeper"}]}]}

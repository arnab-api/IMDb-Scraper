George the werewolf, Annie the ghost and Mitchell the vampire are roommates in an apartment in Bristol where they try to live a \"normal\" life. But they find that life after life is complex and unforgiving. And the \"normal\" people can be as frightening as the monsters. Dealt with allegorically in the show are addictions, clinical behavioral problems and mental illness to name a few. Well-rounded characters and oddly familiar situations tinged with the supernatural keep us eager to walk the road with the series' three protagonists. Be advised...this is not Twilight. This is grown-up TV with all the blood, sex and blue language that keeps it interesting for the post-pubescent set. The writing and acting are top-notch and each ensuing episode makes you ravenous for the next.

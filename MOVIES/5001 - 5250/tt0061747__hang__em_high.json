Hang 'Em High is a rather overlooked entry in Clint's long and impressive film wagon, even though it is a serious, no-nonsense and modest look at crime and punishment and a subtle dig at the injustice system, which was somewhat forgotten by his critics who emphasized that he was a symbol of violence, especially in the Dollars trilogy and the Dirty Harry series.\n\nClint plays an ex-lawman who picks up a new badge after he is almost killed by a group of men who hang him and leave him for dead. He then embarks on a mission to hunt them down one-by-one and hand them over to the law.\n\nTed Post's watchable Western drama is definitely a refreshing break from most other 'revenge' movies. Instead of cold-blooded vengeance, the script decides to display Clint's character, though still as the cold, silent anti-hero, as a more peaceful person who would truly like to see men behind bars rather than shooting them down. The film also keeps it grip, rarely letting a boring moment crawl in even though this is more talk than action.\n\nIts not a perfect, polished or particularly great film - the characterization always stays pretty low and the romance between Clint and the charming Inger Stevens isn't fully developed, for instance. However, it has its highlights - a memorable opening sequence and an effective musical score - along with its notable touch for seeing justice rather than violence and killing. A good effort that's worth watching and not ignoring.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000142/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clint Eastwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061747/characters/nm0000142?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Marshal Jed Cooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003225/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ed Begley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061747/characters/nm0003225?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Captain Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424565/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ben Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061747/characters/nm0424565?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Marshal Dave Bliss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0925418/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ruth White"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061747/characters/nm0925418?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Madame 'Peaches' Sophie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001308/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alan Hale Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061747/characters/nm0001308?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matt Stone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0922599/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "James Westerfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061747/characters/nm0922599?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Prisoner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428618/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "L.Q.

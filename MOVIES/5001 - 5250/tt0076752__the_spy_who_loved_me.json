British Intelligence never gives him anything less. This time he's investigating this disappearance of both British and American nuclear powered submarines while on duty with no trace at all.\n\nThe evil genius behind it all is Curt Jurgens playing the role of an Onassis type billionaire shipping magnate who wants the world made to order for him. And in this case he believes mankind should start all over again in an undersea world which of course he will run. Just another case of a guy with all the money in the world thinking that entitles him to decide how everyone else should live and behave. Jurgens has the resources to make it stick unless 007 can do something about it.\n\nWith both the Russians and the British working on this, the powers that be which in this case is General Walter Gotell of the Soviet KGB and M of course played by Bernard Lee have decided to stop working against each other. In this case it means Moore working with beautiful Russian agent Barbara Bach and you know of course she'll be Bondified before the film is over.\n\nProbably up to this point the most dangerous foe that James Bond ever faced was Odd Job in You Only Live Twice. But when Richard Kiel as Jaws made his appearance, he took that title away and retired the crown as far as I'm concerned. That is one menacing dude, 7'2\" with a mouth full of steel teeth that finish off most people. Of course 007 ain't most people. \n\nThe Spy Who Loved Me garnered three Oscar nominations for Best Musical Score for Marvin Hamlisch and for Best Song with Nobody Does It Better for Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager and one for Art&Set Direction. I'm not sure, but this might be the most recognition the Motion Picture Academy gave a Bond film.\n\nAnd this film review is dedicated to Tom Golisano, another megalomaniac billionaire who thinks he ought to be running things. We're well used to the type in my area.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Spy Who Loved Me", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1285883161", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBmMjFjZmItM2VhNC00NjgzLTlmYzMtMDhjYTc3MDYxODU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBmMjFjZmItM2VhNC00NjgzLTlmYzMtMDhjYTc3MDYxODU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2009-10-31T06:27:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000549/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roger Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0000549?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Bond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0432007/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Curd J\u00fcrgens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0432007?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stromberg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0613098/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Caroline Munro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0613098?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Naomi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0444584/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Geoffrey Keen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0444584?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Minister of defence"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0048468/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "George Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0048468?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Captain Benson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0083944/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Olga Bisera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0083944?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Felicca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0211767/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Edward de Souza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0211767?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sheikh Hosein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0502538/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Valerie Leon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0502538?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hotel Receptionist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000819/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Barbara Bach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0000819?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Major Anya Amasova"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001423/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard Kiel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0001423?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jaws"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331770/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Walter Gotell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0331770?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "General Gogol"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496866/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bernard Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0496866?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "M"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0082545/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Michael Billington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0082545?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sergei"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005155/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Desmond Llewelyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0005155?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Q"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0229943/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Vernon Dobtcheff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076752/characters/nm0229943?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Max Kalba"}]}]}

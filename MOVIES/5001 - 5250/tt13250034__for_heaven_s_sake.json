The fact that it has a numbered Season is giving me pause, because I am not a fan of the Oak Island never ending genre - it is fun but dissatisfying. So far in For Heaven's Sake I like the mystery, the camera work, the editing. The family and other participants are interesting. Interview skills are giving me some pain. And I am finding myself muting the juvenile documentarians as the Bruh, it's gotta be a body under there! is wearisome, and not loving the somewhat disrespectful, smug us vs. them mentality toward what seem to be very accommodating witnesses. Their rambling musings are ridiculous and border on slanderous at times. Their dismissal of the theory that had by far the biggest probability was disheartening. I get that they are young, inexperienced, fairly harmless and excited, but to each their own. I don't find it appealing. So I guess in general, so far so good mystery-wise, but I am skeptical due to lack of skill and reason.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1973993497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU4MDAyNTYtMGY1MS00MTEzLWEzMzktZjAzMGNmMTM3ZjIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU4MDAyNTYtMGY1MS00MTEzLWEzMzktZjAzMGNmMTM3ZjIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-03-09T17:49:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8437979/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Blake Canning"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt13250034/characters/nm8437979?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Nesbitt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10821477/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sylvain Plasse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt13250034/characters/nm10821477?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Local Search Party"}, {"url": "#", "name": "4 episodes, 2021"}]}]}

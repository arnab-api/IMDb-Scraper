The characters are virtually perfect, each of them with a part to play, each of them truly captivating, and beautifully portrayed.\n\nEvery single cast member is fantastic, Tom Wilkinson, Jessica Brown Findlay, and of course the incredible Andre Scott. I loved Anna Chancellor's prickly librarian.\n\nIt was a feel good film, on that can be enjoyed by the whole family.\n\nIt's a quirky story, one that could be overlooked, but don't make the same mistake I did, quite simply, it's an enchanting film. 10/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi704951833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjNjOTM2NDAtOWU2NC00YWM0LWI1Y2ItYWJiYWYzOGQ5MTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjNjOTM2NDAtOWU2NC00YWM0LWI1Y2ItYWJiYWYzOGQ5MTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Bella Brown is a beautifully quirky young woman who dreams of writing and illustrating a successful children's book.

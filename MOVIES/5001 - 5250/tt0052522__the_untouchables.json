Robert stack,Paul Picerni, Bruce Gordon, Neville Brand and especially Nick Georgiade (who is my very most favorite) all did great jobs. the show still holds up today. in fact, its better than most of whats on today! it would be great if a channel would pick it up and we could watch it again. just knowing these untouchable websites exist makes me feel really warm and good. thanks for being here for us. I've been trying to locate nick georgiade to write a fan/thank-you letter but have been unsuccessful. well, i can look at him here. i miss this show."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "H&I Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3902128409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5ODE3M2UtN2EyMi00OTExLTlhNmQtOTBjNTA4NzQxNmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5ODE3M2UtN2EyMi00OTExLTlhNmQtOTBjNTA4NzQxNmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Special Agent Eliot Ness and his elite team of incorruptable agents battle organized crime in 1930s Chicago.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-29T10:00:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0821041/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Stack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052522/characters/nm0821041?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eliot Ness"}, {"url": "#", "name": "119 episodes, 1959-1963"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0313730/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nicholas Georgiade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052522/characters/nm0313730?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Enrico Rossi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1959-1963"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0273359/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Abel Fernandez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052522/characters/nm0273359?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "William Youngfellow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "83 episodes, 1959-1963"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0934595/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Walter Winchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052522/characters/nm0934595?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Narrator"}, {"url": "#", "name": "118 episodes, 1959-1963"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0681608/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Paul Picerni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052522/characters/nm0681608?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lee Hobson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "91 episodes, 1959-1963"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0518785/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Steve London"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052522/characters/nm0518785?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jack Rossman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "59 episodes, 1959-1963"}]}]}

If only the subject of true horror 'Sati' was explored more.", "reviewBody": "The film begins with beautiful cinematography. The story is unique, bringing mythology n the moral subject of human greed. The story is based on the spooky Indian mythology/horror folktale of a demon who is loaded with gold but deprived of food. One family has been able to revive the demon by building a temple inside an isolated n creepy mansion. Cos of this the family is ostracised. The mansion is huge with big doors n fort like walls n only the old father resides in the mansion. The wife/mistress do visit the mansion everyday to give the old husband a hand-job n while she gives him the hand-job, she asks him to hurry up, to which the oldie replies in a funny way. The wife also inquires about a gold coin which is kept near the demon's idol. The house of the family is walking distance away from the mansion which is inhabited by the wife n her two kids along with the great great grandmother of the old husband who is being cursed to live forever after the bite of the demon n the old hag needs to be fed regularly while she is asleep or she might resort to cannibalism. The house is a striking image on top a hill, reminding viewers of isolation in the countryside. There are no close-by neighbors, as the family is on their own after their ostracisation. There was something very trance like feel in this movie, especially the weather n the locations. The constant rain and vivid, well filmed local landscapes were the characters themselves. It is dark n claustrophobic with palpable atmosphere. The cinematographer did a fantastic job in creating a perpetual and palpable sense of tension and fear. The director also did a nice job of building a concrete, hypnotizing story without ever having to sacrifice pacing. The story takes place in a span of thirty years n the details r appropriately handled. If u notice the mansion in the beginning n after fifteen years, u will see all the details. Attention has been paid in the local ethnic details, the time period, costumes n architecture. Also the moral subject of greed n lust were handled very well. The subject of Sati n female subjugation were sprinkled but not explored. Soham Shah was good n the kids were good too. Appreciate Soham n the producers for producing such a good horror film. Kudos to the director for a fantastic twist ending.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Tumbbad - Official Movie Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2075965977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RlNTk2ZWQtN2I4My00OTI3LTg3ZGMtNjM0NjJhY2VlZTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RlNTk2ZWQtN2I4My00OTI3LTg3ZGMtNjM0NjJhY2VlZTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-09-28T19:38:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3630374/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sohum Shah"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm3630374?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vinayak Rao"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4663387/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anita Date"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm4663387?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vaidehi - Vinayak's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3708961/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Deepak Damle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm3708961?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Raghav"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2933734/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cameron Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm2933734?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sgt Cooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10273643/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Madhav Hari Joshi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm10273643?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sarkaar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1390115/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Harish Khanna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm1390115?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Raja - Samsthanik"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10273645/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Arohi Radhakrishnan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm10273645?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Twin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7807672/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rudra Soni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm7807672?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sadashiv"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8375514/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jyoti Malshe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm8375514?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Vinayak's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3481909/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ronjini Chakraborty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm3481909?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vinayak's Mistress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10011687/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dhundiraj Prabhakar Jogalekar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm10011687?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Young Vinayak"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8334880/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Piyush Kaushik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm8334880?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Grandmother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10273646/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Anika Radhakrishnan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm10273646?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Twin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4149175/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mohammad Samad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8239946/characters/nm4149175?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Pandurang"}]}]}

I've only seen up until the 4th episode, and I've heard the 5th is we where get all the pay offs and where it gets much darker.\n\nThe drama is really clever, to be fair, and unexpectedly dramatic from a sitcom writer and a sitcom duo. There are certainly very funny moments, especially at the end of episode 1 and there were some very funny moments in episode 4, with it being reminiscent of the Mark/Jez conversations of Peep Show, EXCEPT in reverse. Andrew (Webb's character) seems to be an almost perfect foster son, he's a world traveller with a clear mind, good intentions, a cultured palate and wants to live his life the best way. Stephen (Mitchell) whilst still a rule-abiding citizen, over-thinker like Mark Corrigan is more mystified by the world around him, and more of a drinker, and sometimes needs Andrew to dodge some bullets for him (it was the other way round sometimes in Peep Show).\n\nTo summarise, don't judge this show at all based off Peep Show. It's not the same, and should be judged by it's own storytelling and merits, and by all factors its been very good so far. I'm about to watch the rest of the episodes, and I feel like all this drama and these questions the audience has are about to be answered (or maybe not).\n\nGive it a try", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1061861657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRiNTg3MDYtODBkZS00MWE2LTlhMjItNDJkZjEwZDg2YzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRiNTg3MDYtODBkZS00MWE2LTlhMjItNDJkZjEwZDg2YzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "As Stephen tries to follow in his recently deceased father's footsteps and take over the family business, his plans are foiled by the unexpected return of his estranged foster brother, Andrew.", "uploadDate": "2017-11-03T01:43:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0593267/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm0593267?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Stephen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1154764/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Louise Brealey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm1154764?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cass"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2934977/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jessica Gunning"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm2934977?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569416/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Geoffrey McGivern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm0569416?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Geoff"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3025293/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Macmillan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm3025293?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Julian"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9251346/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sebastian Patterson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm9251346?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Young Stephen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0916267/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Webb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm0916267?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Andrew"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236069/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Penny Downie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm0236069?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ellen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1169217/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Oliver Maltman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm1169217?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mike"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1214783/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Olivia Poulet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm1214783?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alison"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9251345/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Caius Luckyn-Malone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm9251345?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Young Andrew"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0753133/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Penny Ryder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5676590/characters/nm0753133?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Wendy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2021"}]}]}

I went into this show without reading the reviews first, and boy am I glad, I am hooked! The problem with this show is that everyone is comparing it to the original. The thing is, this show isn't SUPPOSED to be like the original. It's SUPPOSED to be stupider and filled with more comedy. Another thing is that people who review this show are 20-somethings that are still nostalgically attached to the original show. This show isn't meant for them. It's meant for KIDS. It's on Cartoon Network, which the last time I checked, is supposed to be for KIDS (except adult swim obviously). Every KID I know thinks this show is hilarious. Heck, I'm in my early twenties and I love this show. If kids were allowed to review at IMDb, I bet the reviews would look a lot different. But long story short, this show is awesome and I highly recommend it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Teen Titans Go!: \"Girls Night Out\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3427116569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MzcxMjcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTYzNjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MzcxMjcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTYzNjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The girls and guys go it alone.", "uploadDate": "2013-06-15T11:50:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0579914/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Scott Menville"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2771780/characters/nm0579914?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "285 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0996651/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Greg Cipes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2771780/characters/nm0996651?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Beast Boy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "285 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0152839/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tara Strong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2771780/characters/nm0152839?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Raven"}, {"url": "#", "name": "281 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1146051/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Khary Payton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2771780/characters/nm1146051?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cyborg"}, {"url": "#", "name": "285 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0906945/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hynden Walch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2771780/characters/nm0906945?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Starfire"}, {"url": "#", "name": "283 episodes, 2013-2021"}]}]}

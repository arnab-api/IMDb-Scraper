I had read that, although the movie was mediocre, it was the kind of film that's great for showing off your DVD player.\n\nI am thrilled to own this movie.\n\nTrue enough, the story is cliched.  Yet I didn't think about it for a second while I watched the film unfold.  I was completely caught up in everything I saw on the screen.  If it was a slow scene, I just gazed at the beautiful eye candy.  And during the incredibly inventive action scenes, I was surprised to find myself at the edge of my seat.\n\nThere are some who say that the mix of 3d and traditional 2d animation didn't work.  I couldn't disagree more.  There are times when the two styles were a glaring contrast.  Yet, as the movie progressed, the two became as one to my eyes.  I have no problem calling this a revolutionary step forward in animation.\n\nI loved A Bug's Life and Toy Story.  But this trip, in my eyes blew those films away.\n\nFinally, though I wouldn't consider this film 'adult' by any means, the slighter darker tone made it much more accessible as an adult viewer.  Every year I sigh when I see a preview for another assembly line Disney film. (Hey, let's dumb down the gothic horror 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and give him cute sidekicks!) The look of Disney films hasn't changed in years. (If anything, they look more simple)  This film, as cliched as the story was, was visually inspired.\n\nThe original Fantasia needed no story.  It was an appreciation of music and animation.  Let this be the new Fantasia.  If you want to experience breathtaking and beautiful animation, I couldn't recommend this any more.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3268133145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWNiNzA3NzMtNDg5ZC00MzljLWI3MmItYjRiNTk0YjFkZmI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWNiNzA3NzMtNDg5ZC00MzljLWI3MmItYjRiNTk0YjFkZmI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A young man learns that he has to find a hidden Earth ship before an enemy alien species does in order to secure the survival of humanity.", "uploadDate": "2020-11-20T12:10:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000106/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Drew Barrymore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120913/characters/nm0000106?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Akima"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132637/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ken Hudson Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120913/characters/nm0132637?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Po"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0157796/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tsai Chin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120913/characters/nm0157796?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Old Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0175720/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Roy Conrad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120913/characters/nm0175720?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Second Human"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000354/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matt Damon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120913/characters/nm0000354?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0373254/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Leslie Hedger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120913/characters/nm0373254?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "First Human"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005581/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David L.

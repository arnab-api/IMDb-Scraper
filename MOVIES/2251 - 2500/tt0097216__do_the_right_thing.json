Seen through many points of view Spike Lee paints a convincing and critical picture of tensions in the most diverse city in the USA.\n\nThe film's strength is its ability to ring true to many sets of ears and especially if you frequent or live in a big city. You always here of events - big and small - on the news and there is usually that element of \"racial tensions\" or \"possible racial motive.\" In a city where over 200 different languages are spoken (which can give you an idea of how many distinguishable cultures there are) it is only a natural ingredient for friction between people. Whether you hate the other guy, or are just annoyed that you can't understand him nor he you, when all you want to do is buy some groceries. This film shows many situations of this type and how everyone is, in a sense, innocent and guilty at the same time. If a situation gets out of hand and you have people throwing slurs at each other there is that famous expression: \"he crossed the line.\" Well even with critical hindsight, this \"line\" isn't always visible and when it is, it's faint.\n\nSpike Lee manages to show that very well and with a lot of diverse characters, hence the film being able to ring true with an equally diverse audience.\n\nThe only problem is that in today's America the issue is more about class and not just race, though race and class are intertwined. \"Crash\" presented the issue of class and lifestyle a little bit more thoroughly, but in the end felt preachy and unrealistically sentimental. \"Do the Right Thing\" is much tighter and the film's climax and overall impact is more powerful. Also of the note is the terrific acting from the entire cast. --- 9/10\n\nRated R for profanity and some violence", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Do the Right Thing", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2791226905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTYwODM2ZjktYTMxMi00MDAxLWEzYmYtMzg5MjM5Yzc1ZTZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTYwODM2ZjktYTMxMi00MDAxLWEzYmYtMzg5MjM5Yzc1ZTZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-08-19T17:02:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000732/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Danny Aiello"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0000732?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002039/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ruby Dee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0002039?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mother Sister"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002064/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Giancarlo Esposito"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0002064?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Buggin Out"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0638056/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bill Nunn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0638056?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Radio Raheem"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0071345/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paul Benjamin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0071345?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "ML"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0365264/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Robin Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0365264?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sweet Dick Willie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0762153/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Miguel Sandoval"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0762153?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Officer Ponte"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001698/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Savage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0001698?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Clifton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001115/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ossie Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0001115?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Da Mayor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002057/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard Edson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0002057?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vito"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000490/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Spike Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0000490?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mookie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001806/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "John Turturro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0001806?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Pino"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0265670/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Frankie Faison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0265670?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Coconut Sid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0497578/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joie Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0497578?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jade"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0014519/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rick Aiello"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097216/characters/nm0014519?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Officer Long"}]}]}

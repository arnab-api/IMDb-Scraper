From the writing to the action set pieces, it almost has a slight Michael Bay feel to it.\n\nAll three presenters are on top form but Clarkson is clearly still the star.\n\n'So is it basically just like Top Gear?'I hear you say. And the answer is 'yes', but imagine Top Gear better than it's ever been. The only negative is no Stig. There is Stig-like replacement but it's just not the same.\n\nOtherwise, this show is off to an AMAZING start.

I have always liked Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, and I also quite like Michael Duncan and Amanda Peet. And of course, I love a good comedy. So I was pretty excited to see THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. It did not live up to my expectations\u0085it soared past them.\n\nA resident of Canada, Oz Osercansky (Matthew Perry) is a dentist who is living with a wife (Rosanna Arquette) who he hates and she hates him, but they don't get a divorce for money reasons. When a hit man named Jimmy \"the Tulip\" Tudeski (Bruce Willis) moves in next door, Oz finds out his wife is trying to find hit men that will kill him. Jimmy, who takes a liking to Oz, doesn't agree to kill Oz, but seeks Oz's help in getting Jimmy's wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and his enemy, Yanni (Kevin Pollak), together so he can kill them. Oz, along with another hit man named Frankie Figs (Michael Duncan) finds himself unwittingly helping, but he starts to fall in love with Cynthia and won't let her die.\n\nMy plot description sounds quite bad, but the movie is very good and funny. The collection of actors in this movie are superb. Bruce Willis is good as the loveable murderer. Matthew Perry does a great comedic job as usual. Michael Duncan fit the part of the really big and scary hit man pretty well too. The adorable Amanda Peet was really good too as the hit-woman wannabe.\n\nI saw ANALYZE THIS a few days before I saw this, and I thought this one blew it away. The actors are better, the characters are cooler, the jokes are funnier (I was laughing out loud on many occasions) and the mixture of crime and comedy is pulled off a lot better in this movie, which is strange because there is more crime in this one than in ANALYZE THIS. Both the comedy and the crime are pulled off terrifically. Go see this movie now, you'll love it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4278959641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlYjBjNWItOTUwMi00NGY0LWI5ZWMtMmQ4ZDhkZTZkMWFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-14T13:41:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0000246?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jimmy Tudeski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000275/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rosanna Arquette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0000275?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sophie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000449/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Natasha Henstridge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0000449?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cynthia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001629/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kevin Pollak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0001629?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Janni Gogolak"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272702/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Carmen Ferland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0272702?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sophie's Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0494364/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Renee Madeline Le Guerrier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0494364?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0082191/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Howard Bilerman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0082191?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dave Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0165438/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Deano Clavet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0165438?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Polish Pug"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001612/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matthew Perry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0001612?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Oz Oseransky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003817/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michael Clarke Duncan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0003817?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frankie Figs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001605/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Amanda Peet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0001605?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jill"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005558/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Harland Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0005558?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Agent Hanson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0160269/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Serge Christiaenssens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0160269?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mr. Boulez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0098901/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jean-Guy Bouchard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0098901?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mover"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0323547/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Johnny Goar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0190138/characters/nm0323547?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hungarian Hood"}]}]}

The studio is pushing this film as the next \"Superbad\", just because the director of that film directed this gem. The truth is, this is far different than \"Superbad\", besides a few gross out gags. Where that film prided itself on its crudeness and vulgarity, this film prides itself on heart and pure emotion.\n\n\"Adventureland\" has the feel of teen movies both from the 80's and 90's (more the 80's though). You have a sensitive character who is still trying to figure out who he is, and by a sequence of events, falls in love and more importantly, finds his true self. What makes the movie even more appealing is that it not only doesn't treat its characters as generic stereotypes, but as humans, which makes them more appealing to the audience.\n\nOur main character here is James (played perfectly by Jessie Eisenberg) who has just graduated college and is looking forward to his trip to Europe with his fellow pal. The trip is not only supposed to be his graduation present, but also a way to escape his recent heartbreak, due to an emotional breakup. Things unfortunately go south with his finances, which forces him to get a job at the local amusement park. There he meets some interesting people: the two owners (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig), nerdy Joel (the likable Martin Starr) and the beautiful \"Em\" (Kristen Stewert).\n\nJames and Em quickly fall for each other, but there is one small problem, she is in a very dysfunctional relationship with Connell (Ryan Reynolds), who plays the married park maintenance guy. Reynolds, who usually adds the goofy humor to every film he is in, holds back to really give the character a deepness that I was surprised he pulled off. I thought his performance was going to be similar to his Monty character from \"Waiting\". I applaud the restraint that he held throughout the film, because the character could have gone down that route very easily.\n\nWhat makes this film work though is that director Greg Mottola doesn't overdo any aspect of the movie. The comedy, drama, and situations are all well balanced, which makes the film feel real. As I stated before, Reynolds is grounded, as is the rest of the cast with their performances. Eisenberg, who is accused of playing Michael Cera, gives a very layered and human performance. I am sorry to you Cera fans, but the awkward and caring guy thing was around way before Cera did it. Stewert, is just perfect in this role, she gives Em vulnerability, but makes her lovable at the same time. These two give perfect performances because neither of them have all the answers and it is about the deep connection they share, not just about the sex.\n\nGo see this film, it deserves to be seen. This is a movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore; a sweet, smart, moving and humorous experience that hopefully starts a chain of movies like it to follow.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Adventureland: Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3214934809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0OTUwMTQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY5MjQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0OTUwMTQ2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY5MjQzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "During the summer of 1987, recent college grad James Brennan (Eisenberg) takes what he thinks is a going-nowhere job at his local amusement park, only to discover it's a perfect opportunity to prepare himself for the real world.", "uploadDate": "2008-11-25T14:52:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0251986/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jesse Eisenberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0251986?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Brennan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0319636/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jack Gilpin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0319636?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mr. Brennan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005176/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wendie Malick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0005176?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Brennan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352778/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bill Hader"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0352778?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bobby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2796645/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paige Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm2796645?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sue O'Malley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0656929/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Josh Pais"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0656929?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mr. Lewin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829576/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kristen Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0829576?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Em Lewin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1652433/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Zegen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm1652433?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Eric"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0771414/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Martin Starr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0771414?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1760272/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Margarita Levieva"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm1760272?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lisa P."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1325419/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kristen Wiig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm1325419?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paulette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1926948/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Matt Bush"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm1926948?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tommy Frigo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2141715/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dan Bittner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm2141715?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pete O'Malley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0083487/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mary Birdsong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0083487?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Francy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352558/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Barret Hackney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1091722/characters/nm0352558?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Munch"}]}]}

Deep, subtle, beautiful and cryptic--\"Never Let Me Go\" is sure to instigate profound conversations after the screening. Like \"Dead Man Walking\" (1995) and \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004) there's a social morale buried under this sumptuous love story.\n\nThe film follows the friendship of three children growing up in a tightly-secured boarding school in Britain, beginning in 1978. They are cutoff from the outside world; a life without a choice, but a life with a designated focus. The story spans almost three decades, following them from childhood to adulthood. The surroundings are ever constant, even though the film follows them for three decades.\n\nI would love to reveal what these special individuals are modeled and raised for, but giving away that revelation wouldn't be fair to the viewers. I must say, it's a very unique premise; one that gives the audience a very improbable connection between images and content. \"Never Let Me Go\" struck a nerve. I felt for these characters, very deeply. I wanted them to realize what these young and loving individuals could've achieved in the world they grew up in. They were brainwashed into thinking they were isolated from everyone else, but in reality, there were no boundaries. They could've escaped from the life they were brought-up in and should've rebelled from the establishment. Angry, sad, sweet, longing, optimistic\u2014I love it when a film channels these ambivalent emotions and allows me to ponder about an alternate direction for the characters to venture into. If a film does that, then it must work.\n\nAfter viewing this movie, I'm very curious about picking up the novel to see how the filmmakers translated the descriptions into these picturesque images. My guess is that the book is written on the same lines as \"The Horse Whisperer\"\u2014with deft metaphors and rich characterizations.\n\nAs much as I wanted closure to the narrative, I think the film does a great justice by leaving the audience in the dark. It gives the viewer more room to think, and it stimulates an array of intelligent inquiries. \"Never Let Me Go\" dares the viewer to look beyond the beautiful imagery and delicate character interrelationships, and discover a multitude of hidden meanings and themes. Above all, this is an exquisitely crafted tale about love, loss, individuality, and the boundaries of life.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Never Let Me Go: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1723008537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MzI2Njg5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDIzODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MzI2Njg5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDIzODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Set in a dystopian Britain, boarding school friends Ruth (Knightley), Kathy (Mulligan), and Tommy (Garfield) face the sobering reality that awaits them all as they mature into adults.", "uploadDate": "2010-06-18T13:13:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659547/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carey Mulligan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm1659547?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kathy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3505032/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Izzy Meikle-Small"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm3505032?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Young Kathy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3480246/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ella Purnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm3480246?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Young Ruth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1020089/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sally Hawkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm1020089?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Miss Lucy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2932185/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hannah Sharp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm2932185?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amanda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3485420/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Oliver Parsons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm3485420?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Arthur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0604651/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fidelis Morgan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm0604651?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Matron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0723865/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nathalie Richard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm0723865?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Madame"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1940449/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Andrew Garfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm1940449?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2185462/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Charlie Rowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm2185462?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Young Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001648/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Charlotte Rampling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm0001648?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Miss Emily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1470271/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kate Bowes Renna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm1470271?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Miss Geraldine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4066542/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Christina Carrafiell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm4066542?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Laura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2503849/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Luke Bryant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm2503849?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0858669/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Damien Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1334260/characters/nm0858669?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Doctor"}]}]}

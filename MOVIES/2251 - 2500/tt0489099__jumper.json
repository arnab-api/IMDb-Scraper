The premise alone sounds amazing, the way its set up, how the characters are introduced, the action sequences, and the special effects are simply good. The film has elements of a superhero movie but is - more so than actual superhero movies these days - grounded in reality. There are very few futuristic looking gadgets, the locations and the weapons are all realistic, making the Jumpers feel like a secret part of society that could actually exist.\n\nThe characters in Jumpers seem like regular people. Millie (Rachel Bilson) acts and reacts like a normal girl whose not a comic book fan or someone who doesn't entertain the idea that teleportation is possibility. Griffin (Jamie Bell) is a bit a dick and David Rice (Hayden Christensen) doesn't even seem to realize what's happening to him, he lives in his bubble and doing his own thing - like most people would in his case.\n\nThe film does have its faults and for me there two main problems: The first, I've never read the book but from what I understand in the movie, a Jumper can withstand a large amount of electricity - higher than normal people do. But some of the hits David got in the action sequences should have killed him if he's physically like any human, which seem to be the case and would have been a great weakness to have for the character, a regular guy who can teleport. The second problems is the ending of the film, it's not the best, I could have come up with something better.\n\nAnyway, I liked Jumper when it came out, even though I always knew that there wouldn't be a sequel. It's an entertaining movie and over the years, whenever I watched it back I found those little pop culture references that I hadn't notice before. For example this time around I noticed a Marvel Team up reference that is kind of overused but is still cool.\n\n@wornoutspines", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. trailer: Jumper", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4155572505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI5NDE5MjE2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAzMjEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI5NDE5MjE2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjAzMjEyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the first U.S. theatrical trailer for Jumper, directed by Doug Liman.", "uploadDate": "2007-11-09T17:13:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0159789/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hayden Christensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489099/characters/nm0159789?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Rice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1377375/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rachel Bilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489099/characters/nm1377375?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Millie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000168/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Samuel L.

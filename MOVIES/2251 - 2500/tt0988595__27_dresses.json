Saw it 27 times.", "reviewBody": "Out of a good conscious, I cannot give this movie anything higher than a 6, although, sometimes I think it deserves even less. This movie followed the conventional script by EVERY step. Basic plot: single white female, hardly/never been a real relationship, finds the right guy under the wrong circumstances. These romcoms are particularly set in New York City(like 27 Dresses) or in a country town.\n\nAt this point, I could pretty much give you detail to detail without checking the spoiler marker and I doubt anyone would be upset at me. You don't need to watch this at all to know the beginning, middle, and end of the movie.\n\nThe beginning contrives of the childhood moment, followed by character introductions. It has the I'm-better-than-you younger sibling, the supportive parent(s), and the complete opposite best friend(played by Judy Greer, once again).\n\nThe middle consist of the turning point where the main character begins to fall for the leading male role(to my surprise, James Marsden played the lead and not the \"other man\" this time around) but completely denies it until the ending of the middle, which is usually followed by the embarrassing climax of the movie... that follows with a melancholic montage.\n\nThe ending... *sigh* the most predictable of them all. The leading female comes to the realization of her mistakes and through some usually comedic last-minute scenarios, she apologizes and get her man.\n\nWe saw this over and over. I'm seriously not one to complain about predictable movies. I can watch the clich\u00e9 romcom and still enjoy them... if they are enjoyable. This was, in fact, enjoyable. I laughed, I smiled, I frowned, and then I said \"awwww!\" as the credits were rolling, in that exact order. It was nothing new.\n\nBottom Line: If you like the clich\u00e9, then you'll LOVE this movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "27 Dresses", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi598868249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NzQ2NjE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3NzQ2NjE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzNzkyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "27 Dresses Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-12-18T13:09:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0450116/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brian Kerwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm0450116?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2572554/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peyton List"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm2572554?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Young Jane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001337/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Katherine Heigl"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm0001337?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1244171/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brigitte Bourdeau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm1244171?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Salesgirl Olga"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2796342/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Danielle Skraastad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm2796342?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bride Suzanne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005188/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "James Marsden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm0005188?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kevin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331898/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Yetta Gottesman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm0331898?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hip Bridesmaid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1788789/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bern Cohen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm1788789?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rabbi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2724665/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Charli Barcena"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm2724665?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Young Tess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2874639/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jane Pfitsch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm2874639?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cousin Lisa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3834495/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jennifer Lim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm3834495?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bridal Salesgirl #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339460/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Judy Greer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988595/characters/nm0339460?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Casey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2874640/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Marilyn L.

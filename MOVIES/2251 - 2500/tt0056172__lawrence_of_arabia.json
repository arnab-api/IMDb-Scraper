The story of T. E. Lawrence is wonderfully brought to us by David Lean, director of another masterpiece called \"The Bridge On The River Kwai\".\n\nDavid Lean has shown us a man's long, yet never boring (at least for me) journey into the deserts of Arabia.  Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is an ordinary man that becomes a hero (at least in my eyes) during his extensive tenure in Arabia.  He becomes a traveler, a great man, and a leader to the people that he has associated with.  Only director David Lean could have given us a movie experience like this.\n\nAn assortment of phenomenal actors are collected for this movie and what a cast!  Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guiness and so much more portray their characters with intensity and believability.  Never have I been so impressed. As Lawrence, Peter O'Toole plays the role of which his name is most associated with and is surprising for me that he made the role his own because before I got a chance to see this movie I imagined a man opposite from someone like Peter O'Toole.  Omar Sharif as Ali is one of the most charismatic characters in film history.  I will not say anymore about the cast because I'm allowed only 1,000 words to use in my comment.\n\nWill all do respect to classics such as \"Gone With The Wind\" and even \"Bridge on the River Kwai\"this is without a doubt the most exciting epic of all time.  I highly recommend it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT3H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lawrence of Arabia - Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1481310233", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNDY4OTA5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg3MjQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNDY4OTA5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg3MjQyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An epic rumination on a flamboyant and controversial British military figure and his conflicted loyalties during wartime service", "uploadDate": "2008-11-18T13:55:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000564/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter O'Toole"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056172/characters/nm0000564?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "T.E.

As he has to travel to and from various courts, this makes it a whole easier. And the car and Mason thereby become a business expense. Roy Cohn would have been proud.\n\nMcConaughey is no idealist, his services come at a price. But it turns out he has some scruples and they are put to the test when rich boy Ryan Phillippe and his mother Frances Fisher hire him to defend Ryan when he's arrested for rape. He was literally caught in the act as two neighbors broke in and held him for the cops for raping Marguerite Levieva. \n\nDue to the canons of the Bar Association ethics McConaughey finds himself in a jackpot similar to the one Al Pacino found himself when he played a young idealistic lawyer in And Justice For All. But the results are a whole lot different because McConaughey is not an idealist and he makes those canons work for him.\n\nThe film looks like the pilot of a TV series, but I doubt we'll get any of the big name stars there if such a thing comes to pass. Marisa Tomei co-stars as McConaughey's ex-wife and a prosecutor to boot. Can't imagine what broke that marriage up. William H. Macy has a key role in this film as well as a private investigator who works for McConaughey and does very well in it.\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer is a very well done addition to the legal cinema with a cast that fills its roles out to a \"T\". I would really recommend renting the Al Pacino classic And Justice For All and see the very great similarities and key differences in both of these films.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Lincoln Lawyer: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1627364121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MjE1MTE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjkwOTUzNA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MjE1MTE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjkwOTUzNA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In Los Angeles, Mickey Haller (McConaughey) is a criminal defense attorney who operates out of the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car.

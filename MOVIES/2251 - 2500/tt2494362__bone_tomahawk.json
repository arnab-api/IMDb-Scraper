Craig Zahler, who also wrote this gruesome, filthy western of how wild the west can really get. More so impressive that the whole film was shot in just 21 days. \n\nAn outlaw drifter wanders into the town of Bright Hope unknowingly leading a tribe of savage, inbred, natives better known as Troglodytes which translates as Cave-dweller.\" During the night, these horrific abominations murder and kidnap some of the town folk, one being the wife of a crippled rancher, who then embarks on a rescue mission with the town sheriff, his old and incapable deputy and an over confident gunslinger. \n\nKurt Russell heads up the rescue posse as Sheriff Hunt, slipping comfortably into his western boots. Richard Jenkins plays his ageing deputy, Patrick Wilson the limping, desperate rancher and an impressive Matthew Fox who stole the screen, as the charismatic, narcissistic know-it- all who both annoying yet strangely likable, reminding me a little of Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. \n\nThere's an air of mystery for the majority of the film, keeping the audience on tender hooks waiting to see what's in store for the rescue party. Are the kidnapped still alive? Dead? Or worse? While some elements are left to your imagination, you can only think of the worse, but what isn't, is nothing short of disturbing.\n\nThe gory violence is shocking to watch, even just hearing the graphic noises is enough. The sound is gruesome, bloody and unsettling. The climatic end was actually painful to watch, scarring the memory making me shudder just at the thought of it. The lack of a score only intensifies the haunting atmosphere. \n\nSomething has to be said for the special effects, make-up and the sound engineering that were all completely on point. I've never seen a more gory western, even more so than The Hateful Eight. The makeup and effects throughout are amazing but they really go beyond during the epic climax. \n\nThere's been a few disturbing films this year, visually, Neon Demon and imagination wise, Nocturnal Animals springing to mind but this one really made me wrench covering my mouth with both hands. It's like those good horrors you're too scared to watch but find yourself mesmerised to the screen regardless. This is certainly not one for the weak stomached. Kudos to director Zahler for created a stunning western with a difference, becoming borderline horror. \n\nRunning Time: 7 The Cast: 9 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 9 Script: 7 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the sound and graphic quality. \n\n86% 9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H12M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bone Tomahawk", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi601864729", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU1ZTM0ZWQtZWRhZS00YmNkLWFhZjYtN2M2NmZlYTkxMzhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU1ZTM0ZWQtZWRhZS00YmNkLWFhZjYtN2M2NmZlYTkxMzhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Bone Tomahawk", "uploadDate": "2018-12-05T17:06:32Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000621/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kurt Russell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0000621?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sheriff Hunt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0289142/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matthew Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0289142?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brooder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3827455/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lili Simmons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm3827455?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Samantha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000274/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "David Arquette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0000274?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Purvis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0354085/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sid Haig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0354085?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Buddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0866055/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "James Tolkan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0866055?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Pianist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0565647/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Zahn McClarnon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0565647?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "The Professor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5898124/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jeremy Tardy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm5898124?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Buford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0933940/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Patrick Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0933940?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Arthur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420955/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard Jenkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0420955?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chicory"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2797756/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Evan Jonigkeit"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm2797756?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Deputy Nick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0577329/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Fred Melamed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0577329?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Clarence"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364110/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maestro Harrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0364110?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gizzard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0606700/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kathryn Morris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm0606700?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lorna Hunt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3961686/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Michael Emery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2494362/characters/nm3961686?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Redheaded Fellow"}]}]}

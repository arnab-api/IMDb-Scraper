They usually lag out the plot or leave you struggling to follow along. That wasn't the case with The Exorcist. The plot is step-by-step easy to follow, but the show is very forceful--no lag, here. I am VERY impressed with this show.\n\nHorror thrillers that air on television are usually fly-by-night and usually don't fair well among viewers. That wasn't the case with The Exorcist. This is a strong show with a strong plot, and is really well-cast. I had it's reel-you-in hooks and I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. One of my favorite scenes, though not scary, was the dining room scene where Katherine berated her dad's mental capacity, only to be chastised by Father Tomas. I LOVED that scene! \n\nI won't publish any spoilers, even if I had any. I just wanted to post that I think this could potentially be one of the scariest shows on television. I'm a die-hard horror fan, and I can appreciate watching (in my opinion, anyway)one of the best horror remakes I've seen in a long time... And, at 58 y/o, I've seen a lot of horror! It isn't bloody-gory yet, but for me, that could well be part of its appeal.\n\nPersonally, I would've rated it a 10, but I noticed only five episodes listed. I hope that isn't so, as the first episode was really intriguing and five episodes do not equal a fulfilling season--it's more a tasteless tease.\n\nKUDOS to everyone involved in the making of this show. It is very well written, cast, directed and produced. This is truly refreshing. My television screen was getting boring.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Comic-Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4026578713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjY1Nzk2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2MTM1OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjY1Nzk2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2MTM1OTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Comic-Con Trailer for \"The Exorcist\" on Fox.", "uploadDate": "2016-07-25T01:15:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1270781/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alfonso Herrera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm1270781?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Father Tomas Ortega"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5339326/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kurt Egyiawan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm5339326?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Father Bennett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3526370/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brianne Howey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm3526370?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kat Rance"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6552202/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brianna Hildebrand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm6552202?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Verity"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0158626/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Cho"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm0158626?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Andrew Kim"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5372762/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Alex Barima"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm5372762?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Shelby"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0199842/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ben Daniels"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm0199842?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Father Marcus Keane"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2453033/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hannah Kasulka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm2453033?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Casey Rance"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4050835/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Li Jun Li"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm4050835?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rose Cooper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001688/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alan Ruck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm0001688?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Henry Rance"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000133/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Geena Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm0000133?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Angela Rance"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6073396/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hunter Dillon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5368542/characters/nm6073396?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Caleb"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2017"}]}]}

Trailer didn't blow me away but I knew there had to be something special about this film. I haven't seen Sean Baker's previous effort, Tangerine, so I didn't really have a barometer for what to expect. I can safely say the film works so well. It's incredibly well acted, and utilizes a charming and emotional script to convey an experience you won't soon forget.\n\nThe film follows a young girl named Moonee (played by a really good young Brooklynn Kimberly Prince) and her mom who live in an extended stay motel managed by Bobby (Willem Dafoe). Halley, Moone's mother, has trouble making ends meet and does whatever she can to raise her daughter but her brash personality and lifestyle makes life difficult during their stay at the motel. Bobby tries his best to watch over them but realizes how tough it is keeping them as guests.\n\nIts hard to say much more without giving away key plot points. I have to say this film is a joyous good time. The kid performers are mostly yelling loudly and running around on adventures. you know, being typical hyper kids. Its done so well though. I think Baker may have legitimately had the child actors improvise their lines because everything felt extremely natural. Newcomer Bria Vinaite, wow. She is livewire. Love or hate her character, she is loudly unapologetic and rebellious and just wonderfully portrayed. Defoe is also typically great. Bobby is such an identifiable character.\n\nBaker uses his lenses to study a part of under-represented America. We don't get a lot of films about struggling families who find it hard to get by, definitely not the typical \"Hollywood\" character story. The film is definitely going to hit a lot of viewers hard at the end. Its a rather beautiful ending that reflects the innocence of the mischievous but ultimately innocent children. This could really be an Oscar contender.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Florida Project", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1923202841", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNmMDk3YjgtMjM2OC00Y2RjLWIwNDQtM2IwM2RmMDM4ZDYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNmMDk3YjgtMjM2OC00Y2RjLWIwNDQtM2IwM2RmMDM4ZDYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 2", "uploadDate": "2019-09-04T17:06:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7737419/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brooklynn Prince"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm7737419?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Moonee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6566215/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Aiden Malik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm6566215?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dicky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8557023/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Valeria Cotto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm8557023?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jancey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8458915/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bria Vinaite"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm8458915?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Halley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8912883/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jasineia Ramos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm8912883?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Luci"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8912884/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rosa Medina Perez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm8912884?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bertha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7698037/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Krystal Nicole Watts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm7698037?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Case Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8912886/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kelly Fitzgerald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm8912886?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Twistee Treat Girl's Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8912882/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christopher Rivera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm8912882?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Scooty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5339860/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Josie Olivo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm5339860?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Grandma Stacy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3208044/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Edward Pagan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm3208044?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dicky's Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5706763/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Patti Wiley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm5706763?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Amber"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000353/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Willem Dafoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm0000353?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bobby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6438617/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mela Murder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm6438617?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ashley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8912885/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bronwyn Valley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5649144/characters/nm8912885?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Twistee Treat Girl"}]}]}

Instead of taking care of a real child she is paid to look after a life-like doll and pretty soon she begins to think that it's actually alive.\n\nI must admit that I'm a little surprised that THE BOY has gotten so many positive reviews because I found it to be rather lame in most spots. I think there's a great movie here but sadly it is buried behind a bunch of cheap and rather annoying jump scares that are never actually scary.\n\nThere are moments in the film where it actually works and this is when there's more of a psychological nature where we really don't know if the doll is alive or if perhaps the nanny is just losing her mind. I couldn't help but think how much better this aspect would have been but THE BOY is a PG-13 rated horror film meant to shock and scare teenagers so obviously they need jump scares. As I said, none of the scares are every scary and it should come as no shock that the majority of them are silly dream sequences.\n\nAnother problem with this film is that there's really not enough atmosphere to make anything else all that creepy. The film basically takes elements of CHILD'S PLAY, ANNABELLE, THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and BAD RONALD and puts it into a blender. The only problem is that it's just not all that good. I thought Cohan and Rupert Evans were good in their roles but this can't save the picture."}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2191504665", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDgyNTYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTcwMTc3NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDgyNTYyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTcwMTc3NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An American nanny is shocked that her new English family's boy is actually a life-sized doll.", "uploadDate": "2016-01-21T15:45:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659348/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lauren Cohan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm1659348?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Greta Evans"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3609439/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Russell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm3609439?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brahms Heelshire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0362051/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Diana Hardcastle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm0362051?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Heelshire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4810527/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jett Klyne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm4810527?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brahms (Child)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0908022/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matthew Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm0908022?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Taxi Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1140344/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rupert Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm1140344?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Malcolm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0636235/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jim Norton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm0636235?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mr. Heelshire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4466085/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ben Robson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm4466085?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cole"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7846408/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lily Pater"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm7846408?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Emily Cribbs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1107254/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stephanie Lemelin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3882082/characters/nm1107254?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sandy"}]}]}

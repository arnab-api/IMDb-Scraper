So when I heard that a sequel was in the making, I was excited but understandably cautious since the Disappointing Sequel Syndrome is all too common nowadays. I also disapproved of the director switch, fearing that yet another low-budget gem will be Americanised by Hollywood, made far too slick for its own good.\n\nSo to say 28 Weeks Later was a pleasant surprise would be an understatement. Fresnadillo managed to maintain everything that was good in the original and add his own flair. The rage virus, the zombies and the gore are all still here. But most importantly, what keeps the series shockingly vivid is the willingness to flaunt the naked truth: we humans are the real monsters. Under such extreme circumstances, mankind's self-preservation instincts kicks in and it is an ugly sight to see. It might be the necessary thing to do, but that still doesn't make it feel right.\n\nThe film starts off at an odd pace but soon settles into a familiar terror-stricken rush. The cast was well selected, nothing out of the ordinary but no obvious weak links either. The Americanisation was not as severe as I had previously dreaded, and I actually quite welcomed Rose Byrne and Jeremy Renner leading the plot. The shots of post-apocalyptic London may have been done already but they're still as effective as ever, and John Murphy's score is brilliant as always.\n\nAll in all, a worthy sequel to Days and very few fans will be disappointed, I hope.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "28 Weeks Later", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4088594713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAyMDE1NzYtMjg3ZC00MjE4LThjOGMtYmZiOTUwOTY5MjA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAyMDE1NzYtMjg3ZC00MjE4LThjOGMtYmZiOTUwOTY5MjA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T03:11:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001015/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Carlyle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0001015?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Don"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719637/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jeremy Renner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0719637?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Doyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001517/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Catherine McCormack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0001517?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1782299/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Imogen Poots"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm1782299?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tammy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0907510/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amanda Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0907510?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sally"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0604669/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Garfield Morgan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0604669?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Geoff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1570666/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jordan El-Balawi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm1570666?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Boy in Cottage"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0991334/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stewart Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0991334?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Military Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0126284/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rose Byrne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0126284?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Scarlet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0674782/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Harold Perrineau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0674782?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Flynn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0252961/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Idris Elba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm0252961?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Stone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2369208/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mackintosh Muggleton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm2369208?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Andy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1693067/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shahid Ahmed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm1693067?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jacob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2387806/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Emily Beecham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm2387806?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Karen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2395629/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Meghan Popiel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463854/characters/nm2395629?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "DLR Soldier"}]}]}

Drishyam is a remake of the Malayalam movie by the same title.\u00a0The movie is nestled in a Goan village, the kind where everyone knows one- another. The protagonist is a middle-class Goan\u00a0Vijay Salgaonkar( Ajay Devgn) for whom his family's well being is paramount.\n\nAjay plays the role of a 5th class school-dropout who runs a local cable-service provider shop. He is a big movie-buff and spends most of his time at work looking at the motion pictures. \u00a0\n\nVijay has a cozy life with his wife Nandini(Shriya Saran) , elder daughter( Ishita Dutta, 'Poonam\u00a0 from Ek Ghar Banaunga'\u00a0 & Tanushree Dutta's sister) and younger daughter(Mrinal Jadhav).\u00a0 The coziness of his family is shattered one night following an offhand chain of events.\n\nVijay's character development is myriad throughout the film and it compels you to think away from the extreme principles of black vs white,\u00a0 right vs wrong, yin vs yang.\u00a0 His strong will and steadfastness to protect his family at all costs forms the backbone of the story.\n\nThe unfateful night's chain of events leads to a massive police search headed by the stern and steely IPS Meera Deshmukh (Tabu).\n\nTabu's acting is top-notch in multiple interrogation\u00a0 scenes throughout the movie with a distinct no-nonsense persona on display at all times.\n\nIshita Dutta is remarkable in her Bollywood debut with a wide palette of emotions. Mrinal Jadhav plays the role of the innocent and adorable younger daughter splendidly, generating a few interspersed audience laughs.\n\nRajat Kapoor has a knack for playing the upper-class, businessmen \u2013roles and is casted perfectly as Tabu's husband. However his character is a bit monochromatic, probably due to the script.\n\nThe movie has multiple twists arousing the curiosity of the audience culminating into a superb climax.\n\nEven though the film is 2 hours and 43 minutes long, it binds the audience to their seats till the very last scene.\n\nI strongly recommend this film, especially to the thriller genre lovers.\n\nP.S. The film also teaches you why watching movies can impart you with paramount life-skills. So, definitely a connect with the movie buffs :)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Drishyam trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1972222745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWViN2I2MjktOGNkNC00NDQzLTg0OGYtNjAxYmM1YWUwYjRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWViN2I2MjktOGNkNC00NDQzLTg0OGYtNjAxYmM1YWUwYjRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Desperate measures are taken by a man who tries to save his family from the dark side of the law, after they commit an unexpected crime.", "uploadDate": "2018-06-14T07:51:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0222426/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ajay Devgn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4430212/characters/nm0222426?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vijay Salgaonkar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007102/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tabu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4430212/characters/nm0007102?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "I.G.

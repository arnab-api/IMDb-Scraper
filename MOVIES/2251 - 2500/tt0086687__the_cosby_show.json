Some felt the show went a little to far as showing a black family being to successful. The heads of the house were both rich and successful \"Cliff\" a doctor and Clair a lawyer. I enjoyed this show for the funny moments it brought. The adventures of the Huxtable kids always found entertaining never a dull moment was found with Sondra, Denise, Theo, and little Rudy. Most important the character of Bill Cosby that being Dr. Heathcliff \"Cliff\" Huxtable was the one to watch. I always looked at Bill and even his character as a role model for the good advice that was given. \"Cliff\" and even Bill Cosby always did listen and give great advice to a person. Both made great father figures, no wonder \"The, Cosby Show\" was such a hit and made Bill Cosby so popular and wealthy in the entertainment business. You can still watch the reruns of this hit series on TBS so watch your friend many times again that being Bill Cosby and Dr. Heathcliff."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Cosby Show: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2297430297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFiODRjNGQtYjM5Mi00NmQyLWFlMDMtZmRiNGZjZWNmZDZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXJoYW5uYWg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFiODRjNGQtYjM5Mi00NmQyLWFlMDMtZmRiNGZjZWNmZDZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXJoYW5uYWg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Urban Works", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:36:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001070/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bill Cosby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086687/characters/nm0001070?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Heathcliff 'Cliff' Huxtable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "197 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0700443/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Keshia Knight Pulliam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086687/characters/nm0700443?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rudy Huxtable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "177 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0088144/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tempestt Bledsoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086687/characters/nm0088144?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Vanessa Huxtable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0711118/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Phylicia Rashad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086687/characters/nm0711118?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Clair Huxtable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "194 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0912528/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Malcolm-Jamal Warner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086687/characters/nm0912528?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Theo Huxtable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "176 episodes, 1984-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000956/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lisa Bonet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086687/characters/nm0000956?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Denise Huxtable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "120 episodes, 1984-1991"}]}]}

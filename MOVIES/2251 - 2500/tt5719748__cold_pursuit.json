Beware, it's not the movie you think it is. The trailer basically committed some of the most blatant fraud I've seen in Hollywood, ever. Once I knew what I was getting into, the movie got very enjoyable. For people expecting a typical revenge movie, they were probably very, very unhappy.\n\nI will probably buy this movie when it comes out, simply because it deserves it. I can rewatch this a few more times. Yes, some things were predictable, but I think much of it was intentional, right down to Liam Neeson's casting and his reputation. It's a satire of these sorts of action movies.\n\nI actually think this movie is deserving of a Best Movie nomination but I know that will never happen. It was very well-done, kudos to the people who made the film. Very original. Yes, I know this was based on a foreign movie that is a few years old, thank you.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2021964313", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2ZiOTIxMDktZjY2NS00YWVjLThjNTMtOTc4ZTU3YTBjODM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2ZiOTIxMDktZjY2NS00YWVjLThjNTMtOTc4ZTU3YTBjODM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Liam Neeson stars as Nels Coxman, a family man whose quiet life with his wife (Laura Dern) is upended following the mysterious death of their son.

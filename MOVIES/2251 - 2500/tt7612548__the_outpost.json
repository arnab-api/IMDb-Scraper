I did initially give up before even finishing the first episode, but she didn't.\n\nThis is one of those shows that gets better with each episode, the actors, mostly if not all, unknown, seem to grow into their parts as the show goes on, very similar to other low budget shows that start out with the acting a bit amateurish and get much better if you persevere. As I have been told over and over by my partner you have to stick with it past the first couple of episodes to really get entertained.\n\nI now have a much better appreciation of low budget shows like this one, it has really grown on me and I look forward to season three.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Outpost Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3940465433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5MjJiOGMtMWNkZi00NDQ5LWIyZGEtY2RlNWJlNTBhYWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5MjJiOGMtMWNkZi00NDQ5LWIyZGEtY2RlNWJlNTBhYWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-07-16T16:52:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4880301/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jessica Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7612548/characters/nm4880301?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Talon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3652548/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anand Desai-Barochia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7612548/characters/nm3652548?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Janzo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424453/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Adam Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7612548/characters/nm0424453?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Munt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "29 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0539137/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Robyn Malcolm"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7612548/characters/nm0539137?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "The Mistress"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3940484/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jake Stormoen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7612548/characters/nm3940484?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Captain Garret Spears"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7068024/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Imogen Waterhouse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7612548/characters/nm7068024?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lady Gwynn Calkussar"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4477956/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aaron Fontaine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7612548/characters/nm4477956?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tobin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2019-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2201022/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Reece Ritchie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7612548/characters/nm2201022?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Zed"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 2019-2021"}]}]}

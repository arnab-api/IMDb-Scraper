He is a solitary man in both his personal and professional life, only helped by his assistant Stan (early deceased John Cazale of Deer Hunter) , as they are watching a young couple (Cindy Williams , Frederic Forrest , Coppola's fetish actor) when Harry begins to suspect that they are murder targets . The professional eavesdropper haunted by the time his bugging cost the lives of some people and terrified that it is happening again , as he has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered . As Harry refines and re-refines the recording, he interprets what he hears in different ways . As Harry discovers shattering revelation believes that the lives of the young couple are in jeopardy .\n\nThis interesting flick turns out to be a powerful statement about privacy , guilty and responsibility ; being \u00a8surveillance\u00a8 as the basis and theme of the film . The picture contains thrills , emotion , thought-provoking issues and plot twists during the last reel . Very good acting by Gene Hackman as a freelance surveillance expert as well as an intensely private and solitary mature man . His mood of isolation and loneliness is pretty well established . The \u00a8Tapper\u00a8 Gene Hackman learned to play the saxophone especially for the film . Gene Hackman later plays a former NSA agent who is a surveillance expert in \u00a8Enemy of the state\u00a8 (1998) by Tony Scott , and the images of his character in his younger days are taken directly from this film . Secondary cast is frankly good , such as John Cazale as his business associate , Allen Garfield as Bernie Moran , Frederic Forrest as Mark , Cindy Williams as Ann and special appearance by Robert Duvall as the Director . In addition , a pre-stardom Harrison Ford , Billy Dee Williams and Teri Garr appear in minor characters . \n\nDavid Shire's original music was composed prior to production and played for the actors prior to their scenes to get them into the proper moods. Evocative and appropriate cinematography by Bill Butler and Haskell Wexler as uncredited director of photography . This well-made motion picture was stunningly directed by Francis Ford Coppola . In fact , this is Francis Ford Coppola's personal favorite of his movies. Coppola had written the outline in 1966 but couldn't get financing until The Godfather (1972) became a success. \u00a8The Conversation\u00a8 resulted to be one of the best films of the 70s . Rating : Better than average , don't blink during throughout the film . Essential and indispensable seeing for thriller lovers and Gene Hackman fans .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Conversation", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3367419417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgxNTM1NGEtNmNhMS00MTc0LTk5NGQtNGY1YzY3MTRlNzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgxNTM1NGEtNmNhMS00MTc0LTk5NGQtNGY1YzY3MTRlNzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2020-02-26T17:03:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000432/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gene Hackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0000432?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harry Caul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0307255/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Allen Garfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0307255?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bernie Moran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930286/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cindy Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0930286?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534281/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Elizabeth MacRae"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0534281?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Meredith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000148/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harrison Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0000148?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Martin Stett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0793248/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Robert Shields"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0793248?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "The Mime"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001030/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Cazale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0001030?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002078/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frederic Forrest"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0002078?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mark"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383449/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Higgins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0383449?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000414/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Teri Garr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0000414?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Amy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0923913/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mark Wheeler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0923913?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Receptionist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0018675/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Phoebe Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071360/characters/nm0018675?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lurleen"}]}]}

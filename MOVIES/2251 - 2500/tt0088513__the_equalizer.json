Robert McCall was a company man with a guilty conscious who tried to find redemption through doing good works.  Robert must have broken many cold war eggs to make many omletes. McCall's skills were now used to help the defenseless.  This show like many other great 80 shows had a similar story lines.  Where the Equalizer differed is with his method of intelligence.  Like an intelligence officer Robert plotted, probed, planned, and visualized.  Luck and the ability to out wit the opponent made for an interesting television show.  Nice seeing this over the self centered tripe of todays TV.  I never seen another show like this on TV. They should make this into a movie.  I bet the old BBC show the Naturalizer was an influence for the shows producers.  8 out of 10 baby", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "DVD Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3400188185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU1NmZlODQtNTIxZS00MmM2LThmNzMtZmI3ZDNmNWZlNzA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU1NmZlODQtNTIxZS00MmM2LThmNzMtZmI3ZDNmNWZlNzA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A retired Intelligence Agent turned private detective helps various threatened clients to equalize the odds.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-22T10:43:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940919/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Edward Woodward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088513/characters/nm0940919?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert McCall"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 1985-1989"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0843775/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Keith Szarabajka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088513/characters/nm0843775?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mickey Kostmayer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 1985-1989"}]}]}

The trigger that made me actually go and watch it in the Cinema was the fact that the jokes shown on the trailers were hilarious. The film was better.\n\nI was laughing so much, that I missed in between dialogue by some of the characters and it was the perfect film to help you unwind after doing a days worth of work or revision.\n\nWhen the opening scene started, I was so worried that the whole film was going to turn out as some kind of adaptation of high school musical and there'd be a song every 15 minutes. But it wasn't the case.\n\nThis Movie really proved that Efron is not an Amateur who just dances and sings a lot. It proved he is a skilled Actor and his acting brought back memories of Chandler in Friends. In some places, he seemed so much like Matthew Perry which is difficult to pull off for most Amateur actors.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is because some people I watched this movie with believed it had an 'abrupt ending' but I thought you can't have too much of a good thing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "17 Again: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2523529241", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTc2OTM0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ0NDkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwMTc2OTM0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ0NDkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Mike O'Donnell (Perry) has lived a life full of regrets.

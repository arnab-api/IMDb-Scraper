Once again, Boyle succeeds with 127 Hours.\n\n127 Hours is the true story of a man named Aron Ralston who gets trapped under a boulder whilst canyoneering near Utah.\n\nDanny Boyle once again makes a fantastic film that managed to keep me on edge the entire time. What I really loved about 127 Hours was how personal it felt. We're with Ralston for the whole movie and so I felt a connection with him as he went on this expedition. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. The shakyness and close ups whilst Ralston was under the boulder created a claustrophobic and intense feeling that left me on edge till the end. Boyle is a stylish director and brought a lot of style to the film with some of the shots and the use of flashbacks and hallucinations. I wish Boyle held back a bit with his style as it would have made the film feel more raw and gritty but at the same time it actually brought me closer into the mind of Aron Ralston. It helped create a personal connection between him and the audience as we got an understanding of his perspective of the situation.\n\nJames Franco is truly outstanding here. This film is a one man show and so there is a lot of weight he has to carry but he does really well. I wholeheartedly believed the pain and struggle he was going through especially during the climax which is certainly not for the faint hearted. The editing was sharp, clocking in at 95 minutes, but some of the techniques like the split screen got a bit repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite that, 127 Hours is another triumph for Danny Boyle. The film was engaging and tense throughout and James Franco delivered a knockout performance.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "127 Hours: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi768149785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNjI4MDI4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxMzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNjI4MDI4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxMzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A mountain climber becomes trapped under a boulder while canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah and resorts to desperate measures in order to survive.", "uploadDate": "2010-10-09T09:40:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0290556/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Franco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0290556?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aron Ralston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848554/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amber Tamblyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0848554?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Megan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3218960/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Koleman Stinger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm3218960?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aron Age 5"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1482833/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Lawrence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm1482833?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4121613/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bailee Michelle Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm4121613?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sonja Age 10"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0993242/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0993242?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0135221/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lizzy Caplan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0135221?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sonja"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0115764/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Pieter Jan Brugge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0115764?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Eric Meijer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0544718/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate Mara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0544718?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kristi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2505304/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sean Bott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm2505304?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aron's Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001852/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Treat Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0001852?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aron's Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0123632/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kate Burton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0123632?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Aron's Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2287070/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Parker Hadley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm2287070?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Aron Age 15"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0703744/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Fenton Quinn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm0703744?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Blue John"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4041503/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter Joshua Hull"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1542344/characters/nm4041503?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Boy on Sofa"}]}]}

David Jason plays Derrick (Del Boy) Trotter, a likable rip-off merchant who runs Trotters Independent Traders. Although Del Boy's cockney speech is riddled with malapropisms (such as saying goodbye with words like \"bonjour\"), he manages to con the public into buying (stolen) goods they don't really want, pay for services they don't really need, or basically give up large sums of money for whatever doomed enterprise he happens to be peddling that week.\n\nDel Boy's gift of the gab comes in handy whenever he has to placate his gauche brother Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst), who, unlike Del Boy, happens to have principles. Rodney allows himself to be talked into the most ridiculous, humiliating situations, thanks to Del Boy's twisted logic and specious arguments.\n\nGrandad is the third member of the team; often the butt of Del Boy's pranks, his cookery skills leave a lot to be desired. He spends most of the time taking care of the flat (filled with all kinds of gaudy junk) and watching two televisions. Grandad was later replaced by Uncle Albert, whose experiences in the Navy have provided him with a limitless store of anecdotes that invariably begin with \"During the war...\"\n\nAmong my favourite episodes are \"The Yellow Peril\", where Rodney has to paint the grotty kitchen of a Chinese takeaway. \"The Russians Are Coming\" is (or was) a timely episode where the Trotters spend time in their own nuclear fallout shelter and Del Boy ponders the idea of procreation with mutants. \"A Touch of Glass\" has the team cleaning 17th Century chandeliers. That episode also proves that the best solution to a problem is to run away from it.\n\nJohn Sullivan was originally going to call this show \"Big Brother\". But then he decided that people take more notice of long titles. Sullivan also sings the catchy theme song. Each episode of \"Only Fools and Horses\" is laughter guaranteed."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0419248/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Jason"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081912/characters/nm0419248?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1981-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0516181/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Roger Lloyd Pack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081912/characters/nm0516181?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Trigger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "38 episodes, 1981-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0149998/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Challis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081912/characters/nm0149998?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Boycie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "33 episodes, 1981-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0528525/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nicholas Lyndhurst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081912/characters/nm0528525?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rodney Trotter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1981-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0581467/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Buster Merryfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081912/characters/nm0581467?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Uncle Albert Trotter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "37 episodes, 1985-1996"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0531811/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kenneth MacDonald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081912/characters/nm0531811?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mike Fisher"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 1983-1996"}]}]}

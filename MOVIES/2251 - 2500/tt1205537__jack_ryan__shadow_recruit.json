Beyond a some what similar back-story, the doctor soon to be wife, and that he works for the CIA, Ryan is not Ryan. They turn him more into a spy/field agent than the brainy analyst that he's meant to be. As a result, there is nothing in this movie that makes it stand out from the rest of it's genre. It's just another spy movie with an over the top villain that's plotting world domination. It's predictable and generic. They sacrificed what made the Jack Ryan character unique. \n\nI'm not saying that the movie didn't work as some Bond/Bourne/Mission Impossible wannabe with bits and pieces slapped together from every spy thriller ever made. It captured successful elements from those films pretty well. It's just a shame that they relied on recycling tired and over used narrative when there is still a bunch of great Ryan books that they have yet to adapt. There should be no reason to slap together this films story when a much more talented writer like Clancy still has more stories to draw from. I agree with Peter Travers comment \"It's a product constructed out of spare parts and assembled with computerized precision.\"\n\nDespite following a predictable formula very closely instead of the source material, the movie still works as entertainment. Chris Pine is great, despite the writers failing him, and he really carries the movie. He could be a great Jack Ryan if they actually wrote the character correctly. Branagh delivers a pretty good villain, even though he's more suited for a Bond film. There are a couple of scenes that deliver good suspense. It's just not a Jack Ryan movie. It seems that they only used Jack Ryan for the brand name rather than faithfully trying to tell a story about him.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3398346777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NTM1OTI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODczNzM0MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2NTM1OTI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODczNzM0MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Jack Ryan, as a young covert CIA analyst, uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack.", "uploadDate": "2013-10-16T07:04:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1517976/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Pine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm1517976?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack Ryan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000126/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin Costner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm0000126?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thomas Harper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0473814/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lenn Kudrjawizki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm0473814?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Constantin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0027800/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Peter Andersson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm0027800?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dimitri Lemkov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1996829/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nonso Anozie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm1996829?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Embee Deng"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272173/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Colm Feore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm0272173?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rob Behringer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4391958/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Aleksandar Aleksiev"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm4391958?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cherevin's Bodyguard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0494749/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Derek Lea"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm0494749?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cherevin's Bodyguard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461136/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Keira Knightley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm0461136?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cathy Muller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000110/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kenneth Branagh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm0000110?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Viktor Cherevin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4110469/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alec Utgoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm4110469?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aleksandr Borovsky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2015010/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Elena Velikanova"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm2015010?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Katya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1341829/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Seth Ayott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm1341829?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Teddy Hefferman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2110418/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gemma Chan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm2110418?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Amy Chang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1794753/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Andrew Byron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1205537/characters/nm1794753?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Cherevin's Bodyguard"}]}]}

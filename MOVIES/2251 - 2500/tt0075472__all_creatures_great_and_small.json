Then, the series appeared on PBS and I enjoyed what I saw, which in turn motivated me to read the books. The books are wonderful, almost in the realm of Fantasy (perhaps, the books are my second favorite set of books next to Lord of the Rings) if it weren't so grounded in reality. Sure Herriot smooths some of the rough edges off of his real life, but it still seems real. And this series captures the same feel that the books had, which no small achievement in my opinion. Most of the characters, major and minor, ring true to the depictions in the books and I have little trouble using the images when I re-read the books. Both the books and the series explore triumphs and failures that make life what it is. It makes common sense statements about life without being heavy handed about it. You almost feel you've lived the important, meaningful episodes of someone else's life as if they were your own. What more could be asked from auto-biographical (or semi-auto-biographical) material?"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "All Creatures Great And Small", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1244070681", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJkYWI3ZjgtODBkYy00MmFmLWE0MWYtMTgyNmJhMWMxYjY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJkYWI3ZjgtODBkYy00MmFmLWE0MWYtMTgyNmJhMWMxYjY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Clip: Do I look so smug?", "uploadDate": "2009-02-15T06:05:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0863790/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Christopher Timothy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075472/characters/nm0863790?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Herriot"}, {"url": "#", "name": "90 episodes, 1978-1990"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0205749/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter Davison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075472/characters/nm0205749?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tristan Farnon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "65 episodes, 1978-1990"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383662/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mary Hignett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075472/characters/nm0383662?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Hall"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 1978-1980"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0362735/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Hardy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075472/characters/nm0362735?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Siegfried Farnon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "90 episodes, 1978-1990"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0069019/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lynda Bellingham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075472/characters/nm0069019?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Helen Herriot"}, {"url": "#", "name": "47 episodes, 1988-1990"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0237958/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Carol Drinkwater"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075472/characters/nm0237958?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Helen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 1978-1985"}]}]}

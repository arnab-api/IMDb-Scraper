Upon first glance at the trailer you would think its the story of the founder of McDonalds who comes from nothing and works hard to start a global fast food chain. That's really not what this was about. I would say this film is quite unique; I never expected the roots of a popular fast food chain to get a film. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued to see the film though. Overall, I'd say its a mixed bag with a stronger first section than second.\n\nMichael Keaton plays Ray Kroc, a down out of luck milk shake mixer salesman, who one day stumbles upon a restaurant owned by the McDonald brothers. This restaurant innovative service where orders are made in 30 seconds or less, through the technical setup of equipment, staff, and assembly line-like practices. Kroc becomes enamored with the idea of fast food chains and eventually sets into motion multiple stores around the country, much to the brothers behest. Kroc is not a lovable guy at all, if anything he is an extremely selfish, self-motivated snake who betrays his partners and family. Keaton is perfectly fine in this yet again continuing his acting resurgence.\n\nThere is betrayal and greed at every turn, thus the films marketing doesn't prepare you for the type of greedy character seen in Kroc. It is what it is and this is probably how many business men get ahead in life. It was interesting to hear the McDonald brothers story and seeing just how the first store started up. As stated earlier, the film starts off very engaging but goes through lapses of being uninteresting despite being in an unfamiliar place from a storytelling perspective.\n\nI wasn't sure if this was going to be one of the Oscar season pictures but after seeing it I can see why it isn't because it becomes too generic and doesn't really offer much worth talking about besides a story that may be shocking to people. I'm not really sure if its a film we needed but at the very least you may be interested to see the history of probably the most recognizable fast food chain in the world. They should rename this film The Thief.\n\n6.5/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1128052249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5Mzg4NDg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkwNDEwMTI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5Mzg4NDg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkwNDEwMTI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Ray Kroc, a struggling salesman from Illinois, meets Mac and Dick McDonald, co-operators of a burger restaurant in 1950s Southern California.", "uploadDate": "2017-01-04T04:28:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000474/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Keaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4276820/characters/nm0000474?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ray Kroc"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002253/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Carroll Lynch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4276820/characters/nm0002253?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mac McDonald"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1145983/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "B.J.

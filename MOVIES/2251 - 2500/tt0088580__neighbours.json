Although the plots are sometimes a little obscure (the whole psycho Sindi thing, for example), the characters are on the whole extremely well developed and realistic. There is a great sense of community and family about the show, both on and off set. The street is always sunny, and a great sense of comedy balances the more dramatic story lines. Neighbours is now branching out into even more dramatic stories than before, and each episode leaves the viewer on a tantalising cliff hanger. With the return of Paul Robinson, we can expect even more explosive story lines. Having said this, Neighbours is still a family show, and the stories are all character driven. Neighbours has a winning formula that will ensure it lasts another twenty years and more."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "2019 Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1317191961", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGFkYjU0MjAtN2Q2MC00MjUzLWEzN2QtYzVlZjM1Njc4Nzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGFkYjU0MjAtN2Q2MC00MjUzLWEzN2QtYzVlZjM1Njc4Nzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-10-05T12:57:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0219558/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Stefan Dennis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088580/characters/nm0219558?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Robinson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "4,233 episodes, 1985-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0647016/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tom Oliver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088580/characters/nm0647016?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lou Carpenter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,935 episodes, 1988-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597236/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ryan Moloney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088580/characters/nm0597236?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Toadfish Rebecchi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,547 episodes, 1994-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0281936/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alan Fletcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088580/characters/nm0281936?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Karl Kennedy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "4,039 episodes, 1987-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940182/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jackie Woodburne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088580/characters/nm0940182?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Susan Kennedy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,605 episodes, 1994-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3348958/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chris Milligan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088580/characters/nm3348958?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kyle Canning"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,035 episodes, 2008-2021"}]}]}

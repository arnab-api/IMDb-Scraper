During every scene your attention is not focused on what's going on in the scene instead your eyes are drawn to the movies background seeking out the masked shaped figure who has been stalking our main characters as they are \"Totally!\" oblivious of what's to come we know what will happen it's fate but the fun is in the hunt not a jumpscare which is something modern day horror movies have yet to learn.\n\nThe beauty of this movie is in it's soundtrack and the atmosphere it creates during key moments of the movie the sound of the sharp and low tones of the piano make the hairs on the back your neck stand up making you fear what maybe waiting in the dark.\n\nHalloween also introduced (Jamie Lee Curtis) who plays the main character Laurie who thanks to the massive success of Halloween Curtis made a name for herself and became the original scream queen for her role in Halloween and many other Horror/Slasher movies.\n\nHalloweens main star was veteran actor (Donald Pleasence) who played Doctor Samuel Loomis and who's performance is definitely the best part of the movie so much so that (Donald Pleasence) took part in four Halloween sequels and after Halloween II he became the only memorable thing about the sequels and the only reason anyone went to see them was because of his amazing performance as Doctor Loomis.\n\nHalloween was made by then unknown director and writers (John Carpenter) and (Debra Hill) and it wasn't common for such veteran actors like (Donald Pleasance) to take a role in such a low budget, independent movie but after reading the script and getting to know both Carpenter and Hill and seeing the unique vision they had for this movie he signed on and his part as character Doctor Samuel Loomis would become one of the most memorable of his career.\n\nI highly recommend watching this movie if your a horror/slasher movie fan and if by some miracle you haven't already seen this classic movie do yourself a favour and watch it if your of a new generation who hasn't seen the original Halloween movie yet I recommend watching it properly not just a casual viewing.\n\nAs a quick side note I reviewed Halloween after watching the 35th Anniversary edition on Blu Ray which is a fairly decent transfer the lighting is a little better the sound is a little clearer other than that it's pretty much the same as the DVD version of the movie although the special features are decent and includes an over 50 minute featurete entitled \"The Night SHE! Came Home\" which follows Jamie Lee Curtis stepping back into the spotlight in horror movie conventions after many, many years an interesting watch also in the special features is footage that was included in the cut for TV edition of the movie which are nothing special but do give us a look at a young Michael Myers in Doctor Loomis care and a scene that shows Loomis meeting the hospital board trying to get Michael put away for life. Having never seen the TV cut version myself I liked that this additional footage was added as a bonus feature.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Halloween", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi330039577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTcxNGNjNDctZjYxNy00MWJjLTgzMGEtZGE5YTA3ZWEwYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTcxNGNjNDctZjYxNy00MWJjLTgzMGEtZGE5YTA3ZWEwYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Anchor Bay Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:22:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000587/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Donald Pleasence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0000587?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Loomis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0477341/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nancy Kyes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0477341?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Annie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0194234/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charles Cyphers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0194234?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brackett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0028584/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brian Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0028584?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0827111/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nancy Stephens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0827111?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marion"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0944749/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mickey Yablans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0944749?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Richie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390866/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Adam Hollander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0390866?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Keith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0602985/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tony Moran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0602985?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Myers (Age 23)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000130/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jamie Lee Curtis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077651/characters/nm0000130?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laurie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001753/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "P.J.

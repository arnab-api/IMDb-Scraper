Most of them are extremely shallow or violent or forced funny. The very few I have really enjoyed over the years are MASH, TAXI, and Northern Exposure. That's not many, in over 40 years of viewing.\n\nAll 3 of the series I've enjoyed have common threads - they are set in unique locations, have a broad array of quirky characters, are extremely well-written and acted, are genuinely funny in just the right places, and most of all, leave you with a really genuine \"message\" about life and relationships. Without fail.\n\nOf the 3 I mention, Northern Exposure is the best, in my opinion. My favorite is the episode where Maggie and Maurice go half-and-half to buy and build a small airplane, have a falling out that ends up just perfect, and the final scene, with the airplane flying during the funeral was so emotional that it brings tears to my eyes every time I see it.\n\nUnfortunately, when Rob Morrow left the show, it was never the same. I suspect the same would have happened if any of the 5 or 6 key characters had departed. After 5 years it was probably time anyway. But it lives on via DVD sets."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Northern Exposure", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi949616921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJiYjYwNmEtODM0MS00ZmUzLWE5MTAtODkxZjY0ZjdjNjQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmJiYjYwNmEtODM0MS00ZmUzLWE5MTAtODkxZjY0ZjdjNjQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:17:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179224/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Barry Corbin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098878/characters/nm0179224?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maurice J.

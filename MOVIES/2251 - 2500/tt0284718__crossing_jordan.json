In fact, I can't figure out why he suggests that the show started well but isn't worth watching any more. I agree that the show has changed slightly, but if it didn't no one would watch (it would be quite boring).\n\nTo the contrary, I think this show is just getting better. Jill Hennessy (still very sexy after her \"Law & Order days) is really fun to watch. I love the fact that they're giving her a chance to show the rebellious side her fans have seen in a few movies, which to most people's misfortune they have not. Miguel Ferrer as Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Macy holds the line Jordan seems to keep crossing as best he can. The rest of the cast, most of whom have been on the show since it began, are usually up to the task. And the addition of Jerry O'Connell as \"Woody\" Hoyt just adds to the fun.\n\n\"Crossing Jordan\" may not be the best show on TV, certainly not the greatest of all time, but it's definitely worth watching...despite what some people might tell you. 7/10 stars."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3833511449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZjMjM3NTUtMmQ0MS00OGE4LThhM2QtYTYwNTVjMWM3MTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZjMjM3NTUtMmQ0MS00OGE4LThhM2QtYTYwNTVjMWM3MTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-28T23:22:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005007/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jill Hennessy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0284718/characters/nm0005007?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh"}, {"url": "#", "name": "117 episodes, 2001-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0438500/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ravi Kapoor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0284718/characters/nm0438500?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Mahesh 'Bug' Vijayaraghavensatanaryanamurthy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "117 episodes, 2001-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1063517/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kathryn Hahn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0284718/characters/nm1063517?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lily Lebowski"}, {"url": "#", "name": "115 episodes, 2001-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397432/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ken Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0284718/characters/nm0397432?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Max Cavanaugh"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2001-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001208/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Miguel Ferrer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0284718/characters/nm0001208?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Garret Macy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "117 episodes, 2001-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0884313/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Steve Valentine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0284718/characters/nm0884313?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Nigel Townsend"}, {"url": "#", "name": "117 episodes, 2001-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005278/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jerry O'Connell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0284718/characters/nm0005278?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Detective Woody Hoyt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2002-2007"}]}]}

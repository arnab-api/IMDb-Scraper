So let's forget all we know about the long run of this series and just talk about its premiere season. \n\nYears after his run as Sheriff Andy Taylor, Andy Griffith finally got another regular job. This time he is playing Ben Matlock, an Atlanta lawyer who talks like Sheriff Andy. It's a comfortable role in a tried and true format; a mix of \"Perry Mason\" and \"Columbo\". \"Columbo\" veteran Dean Hargrove dreamed up the series and shared executive producer duties with Fred Silverman. \n\nThe focus is on the title character and Griffith is great fun to watch. He charms and sweet talks his way through each case, getting everyone to let down their guard because they underestimate this good old boy as much as they did the seemingly scatterbrained \"Columbo\". Both series revolved around the main character's ability discern something incriminating in seemingly innocent little things and to pick up on a guilty party's casual slip of the tongue. \n\nIn the \"Perry Mason\" tradition Matlock is not bound by the conventional rules of evidence or procedural requirements once he gets into a courtroom. He can say anything and introduce any sort of evidence simply by reassuring the judge that his line or questioning will eventually become relevant. Be prepared for the obligatory breakdowns and confessions on the witness stand. The prosecutors can only shake their heads and bluster helplessly in the face of Matlock's cunning strategy. \n\nMatlock is assisted by the show's version of Perry Mason's Paul and Della. In season one these are his daughter and partner Charlene Matlock (Lori Lethin in the pilot-Linda Purl in the regular episodes) and his investigator Tyler Hudson (Kene Holliday). His junior partner Michele Thomas (Nancy Stafford) would not join the team as a regular until the nest season and it wasn't until 1988 that Don Knotts reprises his Barney role as Ben's neighbor Les \"Ace\" Calhoun. \n\nSeason One's episodes #6 and #7 (a two part story titled \"The Don\") featured William Conrad as District Attorney James \"Fatman\" McShane. The next year the producers took this character, changed his name slightly to Jason Lochinvar 'Fatman' McCabe, and with Conrad created the long-running series \"Jake and the Fatman\". Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Matlock: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1590607129", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2NmYTk4ODctNmE0NS00ZGEyLWJjOTYtOTU5NGM4OGRlNDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2NmYTk4ODctNmE0NS00ZGEyLWJjOTYtOTU5NGM4OGRlNDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Matlock: Season 1", "uploadDate": "2019-04-06T21:18:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0341431/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Andy Griffith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090481/characters/nm0341431?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ben Matlock"}, {"url": "#", "name": "181 episodes, 1986-1995"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0813940/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julie Sommars"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090481/characters/nm0813940?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julie March"}, {"url": "#", "name": "95 episodes, 1987-1994"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0821328/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nancy Stafford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090481/characters/nm0821328?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michelle Thomas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "109 episodes, 1986-1993"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0319739/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Clarence Gilyard Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090481/characters/nm0319739?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Conrad McMasters"}, {"url": "#", "name": "85 episodes, 1989-1993"}]}]}

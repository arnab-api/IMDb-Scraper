But when my younger brother was watching it one day and I watched it as well, I found that my first impressions had been dead wrong. The show's humour never ceases to make me crack up because it's subtle, simple, and not the immature bathroom and slapstick humour usually shown in shows. I'm at least 3 years older than the characters in the program and yet I still find it completely funny. Even though the show isn't necessarily revolved around humour, like a sitcom might be, funny situations are constantly occurring. In addition to the fact that this show makes me laugh profusely, the characters are very realistic and don't fall into the typical stereotype. Zoey isn't the typical main adolescent girl, obsessed with boys and full of self-esteem issues, which is a relief in these sorts of shows. In contrast, Zoey is actually depicted as perfect, which is my only complaint with the show. In conclusion, not only is this show down-to-earth and realistic, but hilarious, as well. Not to mention original. I'd recommend it for anyone of any age."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "DVD Trailer - Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4177575449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRkYjE0MWItODkwOC00MDk1LWFjMTMtZGZjNDFmYjNjNDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRkYjE0MWItODkwOC00MDk1LWFjMTMtZGZjNDFmYjNjNDQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Zoey Brooks and her brother, Dustin, attend their first day at Pacific Coast Academy, a private boarding school that enrolls girls for the first time in its history.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-06T09:29:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1086604/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jamie Lynn Spears"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm1086604?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Zoey Brooks"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1814260/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christopher Massey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm1814260?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Barret"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1662296/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Matthew Underwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm1662296?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Logan Reese"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1842439/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Victoria Justice"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm1842439?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lola Martinez"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1054247/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alexa Nikolas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm1054247?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nicole Bristow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2005-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124703/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Paul Butcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm0124703?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dustin Brooks"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1139258/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Erin Sanders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm1139258?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Quinn Pensky"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0024960/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sean Flynn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm0024960?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chase Matthews"}, {"url": "#", "name": "52 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2397582/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Abby Wilde"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm2397582?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Stacey Dillsen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2006-2008"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0759345/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jack Salvatore Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0415463/characters/nm0759345?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mark Del Figgalo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2005-2008"}]}]}

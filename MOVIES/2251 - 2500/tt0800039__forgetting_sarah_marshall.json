Peter goes to Hawaii to try and forget about Sarah, which proves to be a poor choice when he finds Sarah is not only in Hawaii, but they are staying at the same hotel. Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill and Mila Kunis co-star.\n\nThis was a funny movie! It's a more mature than your average comedy. It survives comedically without leeching off too many other bits of pop culture, unlike Knocked Up. There is the exception of some funny spoofs of CSI and Ghost Whisperer, two fatted calfs rip for killing. Everyone is allowed to be funny, even the women, and they are. I enjoyed the occasional \"Scrubs\" style cut-aways which were frequently funny. The best one has to be the week Peter spent in the same pair of sweat pants.\n\nThis was a lucky stroke from from first time director Nicholas Stoller and first time writer (in addition to lead actor) Jason Segel. I hate making comparisons to other actors, but I kept thinking of Judge Reinhold when I saw Segel. Not that that's a strike against him.\n\nSegel is a fresh face in the comedy genre, and is adept at playing sympathetic slacker and funny man in one. Kirsten Bell acts much better in this than Heroes, and it's a nice change of pace to not recognize Paul Rudd in appearance and character immediately. Bill Hader is funny as always. What really comes across in this film is that everyone, even Sarah Marshall, seems like a 3-dimensional character. Hopefully the days in comedies when people are bitchy or vile just for the hell of it are gone. Even the shallow pop star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), who is the rival to Peter, is likable. There's no animosity between the two men. It's nice to have a comedy where we don't have to demonize anyone.\n\nIt's a cute film, sometimes hilarious, but the first half is definitely funnier than the second half. I might pick it up on DVD sometime.\n\nB+", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Forgetting Sarah Marshall", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1722941721", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3NDg1ODM4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE2NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3NDg1ODM4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE2NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Forgetting Sarah Marshall Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-02-22T13:05:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0781981/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jason Segel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm0781981?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Bretter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005109/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mila Kunis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm0005109?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rachel Jansen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352778/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bill Hader"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm0352778?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brian Bretter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0857215/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maria Thayer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm0857215?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Wyoma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1711334/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Taylor Wily"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm1711334?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kemo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0484688/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Steve Landesberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm0484688?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dr. Rosenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0748620/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Paul Rudd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm0748620?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Chuck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0730211/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kalani Robb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm0730211?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Helpful Hawaiian Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068338/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kristen Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm0068338?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sarah Marshall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1258970/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Russell Brand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm1258970?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aldous Snow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1560199/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Liz Cackowski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm1560199?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Liz Bretter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1442113/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jack McBrayer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm1442113?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Darald"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1229681/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Da'Vone McDonald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm1229681?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dwayne the Bartender"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1706767/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jonah Hill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm1706767?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Matthew the Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1156827/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kala Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800039/characters/nm1156827?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Greg"}]}]}

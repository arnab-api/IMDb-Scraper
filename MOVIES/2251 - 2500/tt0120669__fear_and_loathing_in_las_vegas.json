Hunter S. Thompson gets a call to go to Las Vegas to cover a motorcross race.  Using the advance money to purchase a load of drugs he sets out on a road trip with his crazed Samoan lawyer.  However as their trip continues they encounter all manner of insanity and paranoia in their drug fuelled trip into the American dream\u0085\n\nNever read the book, never been a big fan of this particular culture and ever felt inclined to read any of this sort of work \u0096 however, really enjoyed the movie.  The plot is, well, a trip rather than anything concrete or logical.  There is a message tacked on somewhere near the end but really this is more of an experience than a story.  To me the film mainly succeeded due to Terry Gilliam.  His crazed sense of humour is fed through the whole piece, stopping it being indulgent or pretentious as it could easily have been.\n\nInstead it manages to be a drug movie but also be very OTT and very. Gilliam's imagination really made Thompson's trips come to life.  It must be hard to actually put something like that on film and I thought he did very well.  This vision is well supported by a brilliantly pitched performance by Depp.  He is on the very edge of ham with this one but gets it just right \u0096 making Thompson funny and exaggerated.  De Toro is as good but is very much playing second fiddle on this one.  An all star list of cameos including Maguire, Barkin, Busey, Ricci, Harmon, Penn (of & Teller), Diaz and Lyle Lovett are all enjoyable and don't detract from the film in the way cameos sometimes can (`oh look it's etc').\n\nThe film may be very loose and aimless but what did you expect?  Those wanting tightness of plot and a set narrative may be let down (though there is a car chase for the teens!).  However this is well worth a look as it is a funny, very imaginative film that proved a lot of people wrong when they said that it could never be filmed.  Certainly anyone who likes the films of Terry Gilliam will find much of his madness here to enjoy."}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Criterion Collection", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2996149273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NGQ4ZjItODE5My00MjNiLWE2NjYtMjNhYWE3OGY3YThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NGQ4ZjItODE5My00MjNiLWE2NjYtMjNhYWE3OGY3YThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Three Reasons Criterion Collection Trailer for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", "uploadDate": "2011-06-23T03:16:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Raoul Duke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001497/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tobey Maguire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0001497?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hitchhiker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0147738/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Larry Cedar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0147738?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Car Rental Agent - Los Angeles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001340/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Katherine Helmond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0001340?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Desk Clerk at Mint Hotel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0081572/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Craig Bierko"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0081572?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lacerda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001319/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mark Harmon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0001319?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Magazine Reporter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0726223/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Richard Riehle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0726223?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dune Buggy Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0628170/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Laraine Newman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0628170?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Frog-Eyed Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001125/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Benicio Del Toro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0001125?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Gonzo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324672/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michael Lee Gogin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0324672?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Uniformed Dwarf"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0494040/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brian Le Baron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0494040?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Parking Attendant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0913258/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Michael Warwick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0913258?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bell Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0452601/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tyde Kierney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0452601?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Reporter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0859772/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tim Thomerson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0859772?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hoodlum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0309616/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ransom Gates"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120669/characters/nm0309616?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Dune Buggy Passenger"}]}]}

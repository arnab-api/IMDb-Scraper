Chill! It was a good movie", "reviewBody": "I have to admit, I was sick of the over advertising, but I decided to give Madagascar a chance. Lately, I've actually been getting more into the computer animation flicks and wanted to see what Madagascar was all about. I don't get why there are a lot of users here on IMDb that absolutely hate this film or didn't really get into it, because I thought it was a very cute and enjoyable film for the kids and adults.\n\nMarty, Meldman, Alex, and Gloria are all zoo kept animals who are pampered all day and entertain humans on a constant schedule. Marty wants more though, he wonders where he comes from and what it would be like to be in the wild. Alex, the lion, is truly against this and will have no part of it, but tries to find Marty after he escapes. The rest of the gang follows, but they are caught by the animal catchers and are sent back, but accidentally fall of the boat shipping them home and they end up on an island called Madagascar. They are \"welcomed\", if that's the right word, by other animals and must learn how to survive, but it's going to be hard when Alex is starving for meat! \n\nI loved the American Beauty and Chariot of Fire references, I thought they were just so funny! There are more than a few good laughs in this film and I felt like it was being unfairly rated here on IMDb, yes, it's not as great as The Incredables, but I really feel like anyone could love this film. I'm actually going to be on my way to buy it, I loved it that much, so please give this movie a fair chance. Believe me, it's worth your time.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H26M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Madagascar", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1602270745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNTQyOTA2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ2MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNTQyOTA2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ2MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Madagascar", "uploadDate": "2016-10-01T02:01:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001774/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ben Stiller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0001774?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001710/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "David Schwimmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0001710?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Melman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0056187/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sacha Baron Cohen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0056187?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Julien"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0725200/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Andy Richter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0725200?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mort"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0971017/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Christopher Knights"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0971017?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Private"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0970447/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Conrad Vernon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0970447?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0184748/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Cowgill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0184748?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Police Horse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0672330/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Elisa Gabrielli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0672330?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Old Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001674/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chris Rock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0001674?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000586/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jada Pinkett Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0000586?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gloria"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0147825/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cedric the Entertainer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0147825?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maurice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569891/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tom McGrath"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0569891?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Skipper"}, {"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0569891?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Fossa"}, {"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0569891?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Panicky Man on Subway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1844237/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chris Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm1844237?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kowalski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0201509/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Eric Darnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0201509?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Zoo Announcer"}, {"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0201509?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lemur #1"}, {"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0201509?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Fossa"}, {"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0201509?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Subway Car Announcer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0032151/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Steve Apostolina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0351283/characters/nm0032151?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Police Officer"}]}]}

CHiPs was everything a young child wanted to see and much more ... it had great looking people, it had cop uniforms and cop cars, it had fast cars (hotrods), and yes it had Disco! What more could you want? Not to mention, you had Larry Wilcox and Erik Estrada (who had become a 70's sex symbol). You just can't say anything bad about this show, because it was meant to entertain! Thats right ... it wasn't supposed to be a \"stupid\" reality show, like all we see today, it was meant to entertain and it did just that! I praise the producers for what they did with this ... because they made it huge and I still enjoy watching it today! There were many fine looking actresses then too and to quote a Hollywood exec. who once made the remark about Rock Hudson -- \"They sure don't make them like that anymore\"!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Chips: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1253966105", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcxZmE3MjgtMTJkNi00MmRjLThkZmYtNWJlODhiNjA0YWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcxZmE3MjgtMTJkNi00MmRjLThkZmYtNWJlODhiNjA0YWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:23:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0683986/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Pine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075488/characters/nm0683986?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sgt.

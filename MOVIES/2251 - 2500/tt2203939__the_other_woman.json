Some reviewer are giving low scores because of no depth of characters, plot holes etc etc, but come on - did you really expect that from this kind of movie? This (kind of-) movie is like a simple action movie, you must not expect too much realism, it is simply made for making you laugh. I know I did.\n\nThankfully, this movie is not so much about revenge which has been so many times, but rather about the development of the odd friendship between the ladies and their conspiracy towards the man in the film, Mark, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau.\n\nCameron Diaz is actually rather good in her role, and her character Carly's way of dealing with the situation is quite refreshing (trying to just walk away). Leslie Mann is hilarious and together they pulls through the movie. Kate Upton does not bring much to the movie though, but her role is also of a lesser part of the movie.\n\nI'm putting a 8, maybe it only deserves a 7.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2422712345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1NDY2NTgyMzZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUwNTAzODAx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1NDY2NTgyMzZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDUwNTAzODAx._V1_.jpg", "description": "After discovering her boyfriend is married, a woman tries to get her ruined life back on track.

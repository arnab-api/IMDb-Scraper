This is proved with Pixar's unmatched (touching wood) winning streak and Dreamworks' surprise turn \"How To Train Your Dragon\", which proceeds to continue the ever- increasing \"golden years\" of computer-animated films. Universal's \"Despicable Me\" is yet another gem in an already quite-heavy bag of diamonds.\n\nWith nice direction, the filmmakers were able to combine two quite unoriginal plots into one with ease and without force, and they managed to add wit, charm and smart humor to it as well. Not to mention heart. I have never heard of the filmmakers before, but this is a heck of a debut from two first-time animated film directors. The humor is also not too over the top, yet utterly hilarious and ingenious when they pop up. Most of the jokes had the entire audience rolling in the aisles. The three girls end up being adorable and lovable characters, as per the main character/protagonist/villain, whom you can't help but cheer on and care for, no matter what he does. Steve Carell is spot-on as Gru and he makes the role funnier than it should be, I mean his voice and humorous style is there behind the funny accent. And what Gru plots and does is beyond ridiculous and far too funny to be deemed \"serious\" by any cynic. Some hilarious supporting characters round out the primary cast, most notably Gru's assistant Dr. Nefarious played by Russell Brand, and I could not believe Julie Andrews was Gru's mother, I hardly recognized her voice at all! Jason Segel was hilarious as Gru's vain nemesis Vector. And let's not forget the utterly adorable and hilarious minions and their wacky antics.\n\nTechnical wise, the animation is gorgeous, bright and nicely rendered with a deft touch of simplicity to it, causing it to be not too overly glossy and polished. This makes the animation look less artificial and more fluid, and this especially shows when it comes to the practical jokes. The music score is just wonderful and suits the moods of the film as they come along. The 3D is great and used quite a number of times in the movie during many effect-driven scenes, which is very impressive considering the poor up-conversion to 3D of MANY movies of late.\n\nOverall, this animated film is a great fun time for the kids and family to see, and even some teens will get many laughs out of it as well. This is a very adorable film, full of charm and heart, and with a funny and lighthearted storyline, and may the powers that be reward this at the box office, if the mediocre \"Eclipse\" isn't taking all of its viewers already. Looks like Universal's animation days are returning.\n\nEntertainment value: 10/10\n\nOverall: 7.5/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Despicable Me: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1581384729", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNzkxMDU1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkzNzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNzkxMDU1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkzNzgyMw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A trio of orphan girls cause the normally deplorable Gru to rethink his plan to steal the moon.", "uploadDate": "2010-03-27T11:24:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0136797/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Carell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm0136797?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gru"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1258970/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Russell Brand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1258970?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Nefario"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004715/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Will Arnett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm0004715?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mr. Perkins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1388927/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Miranda Cosgrove"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1388927?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Margo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3220568/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Elsie Fisher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm3220568?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Agnes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719208/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chris Renaud"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm0719208?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dave the Minion"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1442113/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jack McBrayer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1442113?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Carnival Barker"}, {"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1442113?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tourist Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1411676/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mindy Kaling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1411676?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tourist Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0781981/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jason Segel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm0781981?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Vector"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000267/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Julie Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm0000267?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gru's Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1325419/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kristen Wiig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1325419?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Miss Hattie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3269138/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dana Gaier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm3269138?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Edith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1853544/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pierre Coffin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1853544?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tim the Minion"}, {"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1853544?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bob the Minion"}, {"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1853544?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mark the Minion"}, {"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1853544?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Phil the Minion"}, {"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1853544?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stuart the Minion"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1318596/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jemaine Clement"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1318596?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jerry the Minion"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1144419/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Danny McBride"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1323594/characters/nm1144419?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Fred McDade"}]}]}

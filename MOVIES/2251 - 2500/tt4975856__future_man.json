It manages to be blunt with action and violence and subtle at the same time, making many jokes that could go by unnoticed if you aren't paying attention. And despite cookie cutter character archetypes, all of the actors give convincing performances that make me care about them and excited to be along for the ride.\n\nIf you enjoy sci-fi/action movies from the 80's and 90's,then I can't imagine how you wouldn't love, \"Future Man,\" a series that both celebrates those films and pokes fun of them at the same time.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1959508505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM3OTU0MWMtOTVmYy00YmY0LWEyMDEtOWMyMjlkYzRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM3OTU0MWMtOTVmYy00YmY0LWEyMDEtOWMyMjlkYzRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Stars Josh Hutcherson as \"Josh Futturman,\" a janitor by day/gamer by night who is recruited by mysterious visitors to travel through time in order to prevent the extinction of humanity.", "uploadDate": "2018-12-12T16:26:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1242688/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Josh Hutcherson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4975856/characters/nm1242688?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Josh Futturman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "34 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3738901/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Derek Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4975856/characters/nm3738901?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Wolf"}, {"url": "#", "name": "34 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2255288/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eliza Coupe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4975856/characters/nm2255288?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tiger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "34 episodes, 2017-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005286/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Haley Joel Osment"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4975856/characters/nm0005286?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Stu Camillo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "18 episodes, 2017-2019"}]}]}

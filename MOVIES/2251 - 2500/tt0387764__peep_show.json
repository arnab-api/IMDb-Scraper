The idea is much more than a gimmick; it forms the backbone and provides a lot of the most hilarious and often shocking moments of the show.\n\nLike all good concepts that are given a successful platform to work from, you wonder why the idea wasn't more popular beforehand. Webb and Mitchell have a dark, dry sense of humour that will appeal only to certain individuals not so bound by convention, somewhat bohemian if you will. People not afraid to admit that their own thoughts and actions can seem completely bizarre when given a different perspective.\n\nTo really appreciate the show you definitely have to put yourself in the shoes of the two leads. You have to share in their shame, humiliations and triumphs - literally getting out what you put in. This is no soap opera that you tune into so that you can tune out, this is one that demands your full attention.\n\nWebb and Mitchell have a lot of calibre as actors as this show is obviously very difficult to film, being as it is almost entirely filmed through the eyes of the duo. A lot of tricky close camera situations and complex edits are used and work seamlessly.\n\nIt certainly won't appeal to everyone - if it did it wouldn't be a very good show would it? - but those ready for challenging, dynamic television should buy the first two seasons on DVD and enjoy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer: Season 9", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1217052185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI0MTk2NWYtOGM1Ny00ZjY1LWJmMzAtNjBjMWEyNjYzNWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTI0MTk2NWYtOGM1Ny00ZjY1LWJmMzAtNjBjMWEyNjYzNWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-04-07T13:52:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0593267/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0387764/characters/nm0593267?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mark Corrigan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "54 episodes, 2003-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0455057/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matt King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0387764/characters/nm0455057?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Super Hans"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2003-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0916267/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Webb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0387764/characters/nm0916267?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeremy Usborne"}, {"url": "#", "name": "54 episodes, 2003-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1469236/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Olivia Colman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0387764/characters/nm1469236?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sophie Chapman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "33 episodes, 2003-2015"}]}]}

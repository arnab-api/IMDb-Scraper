Did I mention boring?  It took me 3 installments to get through this.  My mind kept wandering to thoughts like \"Why is Ethan Hawke's hair so greasy\" and Julie Delpy's teeth being disturbing.  Not good signs.\n\nWhoever said Ethan Hawke (was it Mrskunk?) had 2 expressions was exactly right.  Most of the time he smirked.  And the dialogue!  Were we supposed to find it interesting?  Amusing?  To me, it was the musings of immature adults, and why were their musings any more interesting than yours or mine? Maybe that was the point - maybe the director was parodying the self-importance of teenagers and those slightly older.  Was there any insight at all in all that talking?  I couldn't find any.  Not one single insight.  Did you happen to notice that the whole time they talked about themselves?  I include their philosophical comments, because they are about their own philosophy, not anyone else's.  As far as they (and those of us who were trapped in their universe) were concerned  the world did not exist. They wouldn't notice anything happening outside themselves.  Could you ask for a better example of solipsism?\n\nI can't believe people think this is one of the greatest films ever made, a great romance, etc.  If you want to see a great romance, rent \"Notorious\" or \"Live Flesh\" or, I could go on and on.  Just like the movie.  But I won't.\n\nI fear that this is a case of the \"Emperor's New Clothes.\"  Some critics called it a great film, so others jump on the bandwagon to show that they too have good taste.\n\nBelieve me, this is not great filmmaking and this is not a great film. It's just an extremely boring film.\n\nYou were warned."}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Before Sunrise", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2797142297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ3ZTRjNGItNjFmMC00YjNhLWE5NDYtNGNjNjUwNmZiYTA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQ3ZTRjNGItNjFmMC00YjNhLWE5NDYtNGNjNjUwNmZiYTA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Before Sunrise", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:29:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000160/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ethan Hawke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0000160?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jesse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0248600/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Andrea Eckert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0248600?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Wife on Train"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0115690/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Karl Bruckschwaiger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0115690?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Guy on Bridge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0542278/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Erni Mangold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0542278?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Palm Reader"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0125379/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Haymon Maria Buttinger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0125379?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bartender"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0422115/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bilge Jeschim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0422115?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Belly Dancer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0918326/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hans Weingartner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0918326?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cafe Patron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0400059/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Peter Ily Huemer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0400059?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cafe Patron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000365/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Julie Delpy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0000365?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "C\u00e9line"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0702541/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hanno P\u00f6schl"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0702541?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Husband on Train"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0748239/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tex Rubinowitz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0748239?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Guy on Bridge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0144635/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dominik Castell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0144635?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Street Poet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0906464/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Harald Waiglein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0906464?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Guitarist in Club"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0475991/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kurti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0475991?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Percussionist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0528951/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Liese Lyon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112471/characters/nm0528951?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Cafe Patron"}]}]}

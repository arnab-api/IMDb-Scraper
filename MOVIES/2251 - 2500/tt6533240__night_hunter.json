But newbie writer, director and producer David Raymond should've maybe had one lesser top-lead and invested in a seasoned screenwriter and editor - of where this film failed drastically in a missed golden opportunity.\n\nThe screenplay had major plot and technical issues, that could've been easily avoided, or edited properly. Then the editing in general was atrocious. A few scenes popped in and out within seconds and made no sense. The music/score was so overbearing it was annoying, and in some scenes louder than the dialogue. Raymond's lack of directing experience was evident in the poor shaky-cam shots, as it was in his failure to direct his sub-cast properly (the seasoned pros clearly handled their own). Brendan Fletcher was perfectly cast and great playing the character of Simon. But casting Henry Cavill was a huge mistake. His acting was stale and unconvincing, as well as annoying with his monotonic dialogue and poorly executed macho demeanor.\n\nNevertheless, for a newbie writer and director (this film being his 2nd/3rd resume entry as a filmmaker), it was surprisingly decent all things considered. Too bad it could've been great with proper editing and screenplay review. Still, a solid and well deserving 7/10 from me.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Night Hunter", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2931277593", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU5NTc3OTUtNjE5ZS00MGNhLWI3MGUtMDM0ZDE4ZmNmMDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU5NTc3OTUtNjE5ZS00MGNhLWI3MGUtMDM0ZDE4ZmNmMDgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-08-28T17:10:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0147147/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Henry Cavill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm0147147?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Marshall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1275259/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alexandra Daddario"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm1275259?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rachel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0281956/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brendan Fletcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm0281956?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Simon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0277213/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nathan Fillion"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm0277213?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Quinn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4590173/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Emma Tremblay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm4590173?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Faye"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0491871/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Daniela Lavender"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm0491871?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dickerman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1481926/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Beverly Ndukwu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm1481926?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Biggs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1307094/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Will Woytowich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm1307094?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Traffic Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001426/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ben Kingsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm0001426?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001804/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Stanley Tucci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm0001804?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Commissioner Harper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1310368/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Minka Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm1310368?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Angie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461945/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mpho Koaho"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm0461945?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Glasgow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4107867/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Eliana Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm4107867?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4650424/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jason Tremblay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm4650424?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2497076/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lauren Cochrane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6533240/characters/nm2497076?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Waitress"}]}]}

Brian de Palma seems to have a powerful attraction for violence and the mafia, this being his second major film on the subject (the first, if I'm not mistaken, was \"Scarface\"), but there is no doubt that his work was good and deserves congratulations. The story is told from the point of view of law enforcement, which is a novelty since most of the films that focus on Al Capone tend to show his life, or moments of his criminal course. This film shows him as the big villain he was and glorifies police officers, easily transforming Eliott Ness (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner in one of the most interesting works of his career) into a paladin of justice and law. Robert De Niro revisits his gangster movies (\"The Godfather\", \"Goodfellas\" etc.) in a curious and comic interpretation of Al Capone, and Sean Connery plays a street policeman of Irish descent. In fact, it was precisely in this character that Connery got his only Oscar, despite all actors have fulfilled my expectations. The film is well constructed, looking to alternate epic action scenes (sometimes recalling in my mind the glory of cavalry battle charges) with moments of great psychological depth and some suspense. At times, however, the film seems a bit forced, with exaggerated appeals to sentimentality, as it does in the final sequence, often parodied or imitated in later films. Another problem with the film is that it is not faithful to historical events. Al Capone's arrest was not like that, nor was Ness behind it. The film contains some scenes of great violence and is inadvisable for children, adolescents and impressionable people.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Untouchables", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1450115097", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk4ZDJkNTItNTQwZi00YWE2LThiZmUtZTJlYTdmYmQ1ZTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk4ZDJkNTItNTQwZi00YWE2LThiZmUtZTJlYTdmYmQ1ZTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-10-29T03:58:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000126/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Costner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094226/characters/nm0000126?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eliot Ness"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001747/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charles Martin Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094226/characters/nm0001747?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Oscar Wallace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000134/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robert De Niro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094226/characters/nm0000134?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Al Capone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0444955/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jack Kehoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094226/characters/nm0444955?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Payne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236711/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Billy Drago"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094226/characters/nm0236711?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nitti"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0195101/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Vito D'Ambrosio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094226/characters/nm0195101?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bowtie Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0043892/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Peter Aylward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094226/characters/nm0043892?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lt.

I Think So", "reviewBody": "This has always been a unique crime movie, like no story I have seen before or since. In numerous ways, it's a sick film...but utterly fascinating, even after a handful of viewings. It's a certainly a trademark of director David Lynch with its bizarre story and twists and strange characters.\n\nThis movie has one of the most evil characters ever put on screen: \"Frank Booth,\" played by Dennis Hopper. The latter is known for playing psychotic killers and this role tops them all. Hopper was never sicker. Almost as bizarre as him is the female victim in here, \"Dorothy Vallens,\" played a mysterious Isabella Rossellini.\n\nKyle MacLaclan is good as the nosy late-teen who just has to find out what is going on in Dorothy's apartment while girlfriend Laura Dern gets caught up in his curiosity.\n\nIn a movie that features strange characters, the strangest scene of them - and there are a number - is in Booth's apartment with Dean Stockwell and his friends. Stockwell's lip-synching to an old Roy Orbison song is really freaky. Make no mistake, though: as bizarre as this film can get, it's mostly a very suspenseful crime story that can get very uncomfortable to watch at times. The language in this film was surprisingly tame.....until Hopper enters the scene. He's about the only character who uses profanity but he makes up for the others by using the f-word in about every sentence. He is so over-the-top, though, that after the initial shock seeing this movie once or twice, I know almost laugh out loud at him and way he acts. \n\nVisually and audibly, this is another interesting Lynch movie with superb colors, creepy camera angles and a diverse soundtrack. You hear everything from lush classical music to old rock 'n roll songs, and a bunch of bizarre noises (sound effects). \n\nFrom discussions I've had, this seems to be a film people love or hate. There is not much room for middle ground. Lynch has done much \"nicer\" films such as \"The Straight Story,\" crazier films (\"Wild At Heart,\" \"Eraserhead\") and classier movies (\"The Elephant Man\") but this will be his trademark film: the one above others he will be remembered for, good or bad.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi438091289", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTViNzAwZTItNWY5Mi00ZGFmLWE1MmUtMmExNTZmZTE2MTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTViNzAwZTItNWY5Mi00ZGFmLWE1MmUtMmExNTZmZTE2MTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-01T11:01:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000618/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Isabella Rossellini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0000618?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dorothy Vallens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000454/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dennis Hopper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0000454?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Frank Booth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0486136/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hope Lange"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0486136?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0225419/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "George Dickerson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0225419?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Detective Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0062844/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Frances Bay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0062844?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Aunt Barbara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0832944/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ken Stovitz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0832944?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0620756/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jack Nance"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0620756?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0337792/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dick Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0337792?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Don Vallens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001492/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kyle MacLachlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0001492?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeffrey Beaumont"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000368/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Laura Dern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0000368?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sandy Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001777/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dean Stockwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0001777?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0688467/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Priscilla Pointer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0688467?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mrs. Beaumont"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0367558/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jack Harvey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0367558?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mr. Beaumont"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000374/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brad Dourif"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090756/characters/nm0000374?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Raymond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0402853/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "J.

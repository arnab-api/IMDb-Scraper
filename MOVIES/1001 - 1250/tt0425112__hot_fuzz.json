Hands down this fantastic film is the new benchmark in British comedies!\n\nSimon Pegg throws you into the extremely tongue in cheek narrative with its quick pace edits, booming sounds and terrific camera work that we have come to expect from Edgar Wright since Shaun of the Dead. Simon Pegg has really exceeded my expectations and credit must also go to Nick Frost who plays the classic sidekick which he accomplishes so well. The aforementioned crafty work by Edgar Wright proves that his style creates some of the best action sequences in the business. Whether it be the shoot'em ups, chase scenes or the jump out of your seat surprises, Wright can really make a film move and does this one ever!!!\n\nThis is definitely one of those films you have to watch at least twice to come close to getting every single joke, because they come so hard and fast it is sometimes hard to stop laughing at the previous one in time to hear the next.\n\nEven though the film does take a lot of twists and turns there isn't really a moment where it lacks energy. Sure there are parts that slow it down, but it needs this to build momentum to one of the most climactic and hysterical pieces in film history. \n\nSpeed is the key! It keeps this insanely funny narrative flowing while at the same time giving a huge insight into the extremely detailed characters. Each character brings something to the table. It is an inventive yet classic comedy that reaches most audiences with its tongue in cheek and witty humour. \n\nPeople who thought the cop-comedy genre was finished should definitely see this creative film which will pluck those heart strings and have you slapping that knee while feasting your eyes on the adrenaline fueled action!!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hot Fuzz", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1020176665", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJhNzg2NjMtYTUzZS00M2NkLTg4NjQtYWU0YWU2MDMwMDRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJhNzg2NjMtYTUzZS00M2NkLTg4NjQtYWU0YWU2MDMwMDRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 2 for Hot Fuzz", "uploadDate": "2013-08-04T04:26:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0670408/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Simon Pegg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0670408?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicholas Angel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0631490/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bill Nighy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0631490?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Met Chief Inspector"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0180428/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Joe Cornish"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0180428?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0556702/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Eric Mason"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0556702?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bernard Cooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0296545/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nick Frost"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0296545?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "PC Danny Butterman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212626/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Julia Deakin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0212626?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mary Porter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2593268/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Troy Woollan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm2593268?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Underage Drinker #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0047155/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bill Bailey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0047155?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sergeant Turner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0293509/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Martin Freeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0293509?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Met Sergeant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0691583/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robert Popper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0691583?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "'Not' Janine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1632389/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chris Waitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm1632389?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0925794/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Billie Whitelaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0925794?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joyce Cooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0927835/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Peter Wight"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm0927835?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Roy Porter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2597970/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tom Strode Walton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm2597970?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Underage Drinker #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2595311/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rory Lowings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0425112/characters/nm2595311?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Underage Drinker #3"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK", "France"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["20 April 2007 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Hot Fuzz"], "Filming Locations": ["Barn Theatre, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England, UK"], "Budget": ["GBP8,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$5,837,000,", "22 April 2007"], "Gross USA": ["$23,637,265"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$80,743,363"], "Production Co": ["Universal Pictures", "StudioCanal", "Working Title Films"], "Runtime": ["121 min"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS-ES", "Dolby Digital EX", "DTS", "(DTS: X)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

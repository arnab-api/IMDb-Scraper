Worst Show EVER!", "reviewBody": "Dan Scneider back at it again with another terrible sitcom. This show is TRASH!!!\n\nJace Norman is a terrible actor and has one the most punch-able faces on T.V. He is not cute at all either. Bug eyes and stupid ugly faces.\n\nCharlotte is boring and completely unfunny. Riele Downs has the most annoying voice ever. Who choose this actress. She sucks.\n\nJasper is extremely annoying and useless. He is also the butt monkey of the show and is abused by Henry's little sister. Charlotte and Henry, and Jasper are supposed to best friends, but they don't act like it. They act they don't want to be around Jasper, and Jasper and Piper act more like brother and sister than Henry does with her.\n\nPiper is one of the worst characters I've ever seen. She's a rude and obnoxious spoiled brat. She adds nothing to the show and is a pointless character. Why does Ella Anderson scream all her lines. Ugh.... No redeeming qualities at all. \n\nThe parents are basically never around, but when they are they're boring. The dad is also a butt monkey and gets treated terribly. The mom is hot...and that's it. They also let Piper get away with murder and boss them around.\n\nCaptain Man is lame and not funny. Schwoz looks like a pedophile creep. Oliver and Sydney are useless characters.\n\nPoor pacing, lame jokes, unlikable and annoying characters, zero character development, bad writing, horrible acting, stupid plots/story lines. \n\nWho at Nickelodeon greenlits this garbage??? People actually like this crap?? Don't let your kids watch this trash and lose brain cells! I'm so glad I grew up with 90's Nickelodeon."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Henry Danger: The Musical", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2785393689", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVhODBjZTEtY2JkOC00N2U0LWI2ZjYtZDlmZDhjNjFiNTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVhODBjZTEtY2JkOC00N2U0LWI2ZjYtZDlmZDhjNjFiNTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Henry Danger: The Musical", "uploadDate": "2019-07-17T13:07:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5836557/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jace Norman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3596174/characters/nm5836557?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Henry Hart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "121 episodes, 2014-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1987953/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Riele Downs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3596174/characters/nm1987953?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charlotte Page"}, {"url": "#", "name": "121 episodes, 2014-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3993221/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ella Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3596174/characters/nm3993221?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Piper Hart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "121 episodes, 2014-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1467955/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jeffrey Nicholas Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3596174/characters/nm1467955?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jake Hart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2014-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1640173/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cooper Barnes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3596174/characters/nm1640173?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ray Manchester"}, {"url": "#", "name": "121 episodes, 2014-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4051119/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sean Ryan Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3596174/characters/nm4051119?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jasper Dunlop"}, {"url": "#", "name": "121 episodes, 2014-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2159995/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael D.

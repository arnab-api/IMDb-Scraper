A far cry from his breakout role as a motorcycle gang leader, and an even further cry from his awkward performance in Guy Ritchie's unique (and hopefully never-to-be-repeated) view of young King Arthur as a slum thug.\n\nProps to audiences worldwide who are connecting with a 2 hour and 20 minute opus that is as far from the new Transformers attempt as the earth is from the moon. Shows that quality film-making will always find an audience.\n\nWould have been nice if the script were historically accurate but perhaps that is asking too much. \n\nIronically, because of the internet, the amount of solid new archaeological evidence being released each 24 hours in today's world would be the equivalent of ten years of time in Fawcett's era. In particular, I am referring to the material of late which suggests lost civilizations submerged in both the Atlantic and the Pacific over 12,000 years ago (see Graham Hancock's lectures for more, most free on Youtube) would explain how Brazil, centered between the two, could indeed have hosted a \"lost city\" which, thousands of years ago, entertained guests from both realms.\n\nFinally -- for hard-core history buffs only -- the written diagrams preserved even today in the Archives of Rio de Janeiro (\"Folio #512\") which constitute the last known \"communication\" from the ACTUAL final, ill-fated, Fawcett expedition were discredited because \"experts\" of the day claimed they contained elements of different language roots, not one root, and hence \"must\" be fake. However, if indeed the area was a centerpoint between two now-lost civilizations originating in two different oceans, the multiple language roots would be expected and natural, and not an indication of fraud.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H21M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2198189593", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJmNDY4MjYtYmE0MC00NTNkLWE0YjQtOWY2ZDJhNTEzMWUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU4NjY5MzM@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzJmNDY4MjYtYmE0MC00NTNkLWE0YjQtOWY2ZDJhNTEzMWUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU4NjY5MzM@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Based on David Grann's best-selling book of the same name, The Lost City of Z is the true-life drama which centers on British explorer Col.

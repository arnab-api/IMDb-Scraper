This series is really funny, really different, and has an amazing cast.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the best casts assembled in a long time. Everybody makes me laugh (especially Eric and Fez).  All of the characters are likable and each actor puts in that little something each week that is needed to make a television series survive.  Topher Grace is really great and I still can't believe that he didn't have any acting experience prior to this show.  That's one of the best things about this show - all of the actors really had no acting gigs and just fell into the roles immediately.\n\nThe writers are extremely funny.  Although the writing is simple at times, it's unpredictable the next, and that's what I like.  Each episode has good scenarios/plots and always makes me laugh.\n\nEverything about it is good and it's not the same as all of the other shows that are currently on TV.  It stands out with an excellent cast (and an excellent theme song.  That thing gets stuck in my head so easily.)  I like the seventies, I like this show, but was \"That '80s Show\" really necessary?"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "That '70s Show: Season Six", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi285255449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg0YzVlZDAtYjE4NS00NTYzLTk2MzQtN2IzYzRlMzFmMzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg0YzVlZDAtYjE4NS00NTYzLTk2MzQtN2IzYzRlMzFmMzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for That '70s Show: Season Six", "uploadDate": "2013-02-01T06:29:34Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005109/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mila Kunis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0005109?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jackie Burkhart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "200 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0696059/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Prepon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0696059?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Donna Pinciotti"}, {"url": "#", "name": "200 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0750468/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Debra Jo Rupp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0750468?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kitty Forman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "200 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0823155/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Don Stark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0823155?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bob Pinciotti"}, {"url": "#", "name": "200 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0333410/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Topher Grace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0333410?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eric Forman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "178 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005194/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Danny Masterson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0005194?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Steven Hyde"}, {"url": "#", "name": "200 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005519/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wilmer Valderrama"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0005519?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Fez"}, {"url": "#", "name": "200 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001748/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kurtwood Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0001748?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Red Forman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "200 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005110/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ashton Kutcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0005110?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Michael Kelso"}, {"url": "#", "name": "183 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000617/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tanya Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165598/characters/nm0000617?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Midge Pinciotti"}, {"url": "#", "name": "81 episodes, 1998-2004"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["23 August 1998 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Feelin' All Right"], "Filming Locations": ["Ventura Boulevard, Studio City, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Carsey-Werner-Mandabach Productions", "20th Century Fox Television", "Carsey-Werner Company"], "Runtime": ["22 min", "(200 episodes)"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

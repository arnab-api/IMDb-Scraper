Delightful and innovative, it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until Kelly, a sailor in the \"Pomeranian Navy,\" wearing a striped shirt and a beret, shows him how to dance\u0085 \"Look at me, I'm dancin'!\" says the gleeful mouse king...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1630781209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWZhMzAwNTktMWIxMS00ZmFmLThlZWQtOWQxYmE4MmVjMDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWZhMzAwNTktMWIxMS00ZmFmLThlZWQtOWQxYmE4MmVjMDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-11-27T17:18:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000069/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frank Sinatra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0037514/characters/nm0000069?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clarence Doolittle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000037/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gene Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0037514/characters/nm0000037?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joseph Brady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001777/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dean Stockwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0037514/characters/nm0001777?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Donald Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0706533/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rags Ragland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0037514/characters/nm0706533?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Police Sergeant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642180/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Henry O'Neill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0037514/characters/nm0642180?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Adm.

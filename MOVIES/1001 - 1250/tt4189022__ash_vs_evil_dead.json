They hardly promote ash vs evil dead outside of america. but here in australia theres a big fan base. this is not groovy. not at all. This series should be given how ever many seasons it wants to tell the story it wants to. No rushing. No messing with what Rami has in mind. No other series, EVER. Has continued a story so well from movies bring brought to tv and retaining the same feel. This show in some ways is historic for TV and should be setting presidents for all other rebooting/continuation whatever hollywood is doing right now. IT shows that new generation still likes real entertainment along with the old wanting more of the same great stuff they grew up with. Im in the middle ground at 28. And its just.. this show puts such a big smile on my face when i watch it. Its really rare for even straight up comedies to make me grin this hard", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 1 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1270199065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5OTkzNjk2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMwMzMyNjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5OTkzNjk2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMwMzMyNjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Ash has spent the last 30 years avoiding responsibility, maturity and the terrors of the Evil Dead until a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind and Ash becomes mankind's only hope.", "uploadDate": "2015-07-12T05:44:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132257/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4189022/characters/nm0132257?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ashley 'Ash' J.

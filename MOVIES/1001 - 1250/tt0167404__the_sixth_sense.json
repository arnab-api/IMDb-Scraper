It was very good but I didn't find it as \"the greatest movie ever\" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.\n\nI enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in \"Unbreakable,\" to name another fairly-recent movie) The story is slow-paced but it sure is not boring. In a way, it's nice to see a slower-paced film be a big hit, as this was.\n\nOsment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.\n\nThis isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Sixth Sense", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1906613529", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGViM2JkYTItZGU2ZC00ZGFlLWJlNDEtNDg5MTMzODBmZjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGViM2JkYTItZGU2ZC00ZGFlLWJlNDEtNDg5MTMzODBmZjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-03-13T06:53:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0000246?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Malcolm Crowe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001057/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Toni Collette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0001057?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lynn Sear"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0605080/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Trevor Morgan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0605080?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tommy Tammisimo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848534/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Peter Anthony Tambakis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0848534?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Darren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0635769/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bruce Norris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0635769?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stanley Cunningham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0939731/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Greg Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0939731?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mr. Collins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0868125/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Angelica Page"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0868125?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mrs. Collins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0051479/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Firdous Bamji"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0051479?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Young Man Buying Ring"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005286/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Haley Joel Osment"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0005286?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cole Sear"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931404/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Olivia Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0931404?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anna Crowe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005531/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Donnie Wahlberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0005531?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Vincent Gray"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1005688/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jeffrey Zubernis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm1005688?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bobby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0280245/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Glenn Fitzgerald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0280245?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0059215/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mischa Barton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0059215?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kyra Collins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0838655/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lisa Summerour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0167404/characters/nm0838655?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bridesmaid"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Latin", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["6 August 1999 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Sixth Sense"], "Filming Locations": ["Pennsylvania, USA"], "Budget": ["$40,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$26,681,262,", "8 August 1999"], "Gross USA": ["$293,506,292"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$672,806,292"], "Production Co": ["Hollywood Pictures", "Spyglass Entertainment", "The Kennedy/Marshall Company"], "Runtime": ["107 min"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

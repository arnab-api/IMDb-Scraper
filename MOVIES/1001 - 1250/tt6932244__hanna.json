She should be more on the spotlight, with shininess and more crazy good performances. She is like a human \"Bionic\" girl with awesome abilities and amazing aiming. The producers & writers really need to understand that and give her increased brilliant spots to shine (martial arts and guns alike).\n* Sandy (\u00c1ine Rose Daly) was one of the highlight of the season. She's a talented and beautiful actress who has the potential to become a really bad yet powerful smart girl in the series.\n* Nothing of real interest for Marissa, aside adding mother-like behaviors to her collection in the show; Although, her personal style of handling guns are one of the best I saw in women and men alike.\n\n\n Again, I ask the producers, to give to series aim & purpose and squeeze it into a powerful beam for it to really deliver and shine.\n\nLess \"useless\" characters and more of Hanna in action.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2335227417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlYjZhMzktMjMwOC00MWQzLTlhMDUtMzE5N2U3MGMwOTY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlYjZhMzktMjMwOC00MWQzLTlhMDUtMzE5N2U3MGMwOTY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In Season Two, Hanna risks her freedom to rescue Clara from the clutches of the Utrax program.

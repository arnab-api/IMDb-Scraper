Though one must note that absinthe hallucinations are intrinsically musical and similarly embedded. (Don't try this at home: thujone, the active ingredient in absinthe is so pernicious that is the only drug that has been successfully outlawed in the civil world. Think about that. Then imagine an absinthe bar on every corner and in every Parisian artist's life 100 years back.)\n\nHaving mentioned all the ordinary elements, this film is the most fun I ever remember having in front of a screen. Everything to the smallest element is coordinated to be a single, transporting vision. And what a vision! The camera has character here -- it is a performer, it dances, laughs, cries -- it is detached voyeur, then intimate partner. Everything is so original in vision, and so coherent it amazes. This is close to scifi -- it conveys us to an alternative not-quite-real world we can barely reach.\n\nThe actors play to a knowing camera-audience. There is an amazing sequence in the elephant when the Duke first interrupts the writer and the inner play's cast makes up and acts out the play in front of us. This of course includes self-reference of the current situation. We are so swept up in the exuberance that we lose our place. What layer where we in?\n\n(A talking sitar that can tell no lie? A narcoleptic Argentinian? The dadaist Latrec as the story's stable center? A connubial elephant? -- Glorious prostitution.)\n\nThe layer shuffling happens again with a more edgy and sinister tone with a Tango to Sting overlain with other music and emotions: the 'real' action with Satine and the Duke. We lose our detachment again because the layers of self-reference are juggled. The finale echos this.\n\nNicole does the best job of her career. She is so totally open here one worries for her -- I suppose this is the Emily Watson effect.\n\nBaz is now among my top three directors. This is a near perfect film in execution. The one flaw comes from that perfection. Broadbent is a perfect Zidler. But he has played this same role before -- recently, and in a similarly nested play: 'Topsy Turvey'. It takes a small chip away from the originality if the film.\n\nSee this. See it twice in a row, the second time for the absinthe, and allow yourself to be ravished deeper than you knew you existed visually."}, "duration": "PT2H7M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Moulin Rouge", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1821835545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNhNzIwNzQtN2UxMi00ZWZlLTk4NTMtNjY2YTM5NWUzNzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNhNzIwNzQtN2UxMi00ZWZlLTk4NTMtNjY2YTM5NWUzNzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:06:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000173/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicole Kidman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0000173?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Satine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000491/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Leguizamo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0000491?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Toulouse-Lautrec"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0746896/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richard Roxburgh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0746896?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "The Duke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0464522/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jacek Koman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0464522?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "The Unconscious Argentinean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0907942/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kerry Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0907942?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0031655/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Christine Anu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0031655?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Arabia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0611677/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lara Mulcahy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0611677?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "M\u00f4me Fromage"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001541/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kylie Minogue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0001541?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "The Green Fairy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000191/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ewan McGregor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0000191?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000980/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jim Broadbent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0000980?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Harold Zidler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0567769/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Garry McDonald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0567769?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "The Doctor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0974592/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Matthew Whittet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0974592?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Satie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640266/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Caroline O'Connor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0640266?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Nini Legs In The Air"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413238/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Natalie Mendoza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0413238?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "China Doll"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0920992/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "David Wenham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0203009/characters/nm0920992?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Audrey"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Australia", "USA"], "Language": ["English", "French", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["1 June 2001 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Moulin Rouge"], "Filming Locations": ["Fox Studios, Moore Park, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"], "Budget": ["$50,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$167,540,", "20 May 2001"], "Gross USA": ["$57,386,607"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$184,935,320"], "Production Co": ["Twentieth Century Fox", "Bazmark Films"], "Runtime": ["127 min"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

The children are not perfect nor are they drug addicted or sex-crazed or alcoholic or parent-hating brats. The oldest son hanging out in boxer shorts? My son did that. The middle child, the daughter, trying to find her place in the school social order but often coming up short? Who hasn't failed at something in life? And the youngest child, the little boy who often repeats things in a whisper, is sweet and loves his parents. These kids make you laugh both from their unintentional humor and from recognition. And I especially like the fact that each episode ends on an upbeat note. The family members, no matter what crazy circumstances they may find themselves in, love each other and accept their lot in life without bitterness and anger. Far removed from the pop culture norms we've been fed lately, people living in 'The Middle' may actually exist after all.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Middle: Always Wanted Glasses", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2292825369", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA4ZWU4ZjEtZmRlMS00ZmQ4LWEyNTItYjU3ZjNiMmNiYTYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA4ZWU4ZjEtZmRlMS00ZmQ4LWEyNTItYjU3ZjNiMmNiYTYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Middle: Always Wanted Glasses", "uploadDate": "2019-03-16T17:13:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005004/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Patricia Heaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1442464/characters/nm0005004?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frankie Heck"}, {"url": "#", "name": "215 episodes, 2009-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1668208/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charlie McDermott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1442464/characters/nm1668208?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Axl Heck"}, {"url": "#", "name": "215 episodes, 2009-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2557831/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Atticus Shaffer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1442464/characters/nm2557831?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brick Heck"}, {"url": "#", "name": "215 episodes, 2009-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0283568/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Neil Flynn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1442464/characters/nm0283568?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mike Heck"}, {"url": "#", "name": "215 episodes, 2009-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1311329/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Eden Sher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1442464/characters/nm1311329?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sue Heck"}, {"url": "#", "name": "215 episodes, 2009-2018"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["30 September 2009 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Middle."], "Filming Locations": ["Columbia/Warner Bros.

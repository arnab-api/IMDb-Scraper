Babylon 5 was a breath of fresh air.\n\nUnlike some sci-fi shows, Babylon 5 was an ongoing epic. What happened in one episode impacted on another episode and so on. It was set on Babylon 5 (a space station)where five solar systems who have been at war try to make peace. The representatives of these races are all based on Babylon 5 trying to create lasting peace (not unlike the real life League of Nations/United Nations).\n\nAs I said, what happened in one episode impacted on another. There was no jetting off to planets, creating a mess and then jetting off again. There was action, political intrigue and plenty of excitement which made this show stand out in 1994.\n\nJ. Michael Straczynski did a great job with Babylon 5. It's actually a very good allegory of life on Earth in the 20th century. There have been two major wars this century. The League of Nations was set up following World War 1 but they soon became defunct and the United Nations were set up following World War 2 to try and bring peace to the world. Of course it's hard to find peace with so many different governments pulling in different directions. That is why I liked Babylon 5. It was realistic; there were no quick solutions for peace and there were setbacks along the way just like we have in real life.\n\nI strongly urge anyone who hasn't seen Babylon 5 to check it out."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi678149657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY1ZDI5ZmMtM2MzMS00NzNhLTkyYzQtNzI0MmZhZDYyOTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY1ZDI5ZmMtM2MzMS00NzNhLTkyYzQtNzI0MmZhZDYyOTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-06T01:29:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001245/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mira Furlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0105946/characters/nm0001245?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Delenn"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1993-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0299122/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stephen Furst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0105946/characters/nm0299122?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vir Cotto"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 1994-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0432867/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Peter Jurasik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0105946/characters/nm0432867?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Londo Mollari"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1993-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0612621/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bill Mumy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0105946/characters/nm0612621?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lennier"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 1994-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0160004/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Claudia Christian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0105946/characters/nm0160004?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cmdr.

One of the many questions you find asking yourself as soon as you pick up the DVD or Video of this film. Well firstly before you dare to watch this film you must be one of these three types of people to be able to sit and watch this film (in my opinion) 1)A person who knows fast cars, 2)A person who likes to see these cars, and 3)A person who knows why you race them.\n\nIf you aren't one of these people and just want to watch Vin and Paul in action then I'm afraid to tell you that you won't do this film any justice (although they are great in this film). I believe that the character that Vin plays was made for him and so was Pauls' character. Vin already has the style, the mood of Dominic Tretto (we have seen this in XXX) i personally couldn't have picked a better actor for the job for no one could pull it off like what Vin does. As for Paul i think it's great that they have used a so-called \"tall, lean, blonde pretty-boy\" for the part of Brian O'Conner because it brings out the fact that he is an under-cover cop. He's new in the field, it's his first mission and therefore he needs to look it too. We see his character evolve in the second film, which is also truly brilliant. So from me i think that the film should be at least rated at a 7 or 8 out of 10 even though the story does seem to drag on for awhile it is still a pretty good film and i hope you will agree. So from me watch this film and enjoy it too."}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Re-release Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2048898073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NDczNzAwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA2NzUwOTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NDczNzAwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA2NzUwOTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the re-release trailer for the movie that started it all, 'The Fast and the Furious.'", "uploadDate": "2016-06-01T07:57:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0908094/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0232500/characters/nm0908094?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brian O'Conner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0735442/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michelle Rodriguez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0232500/characters/nm0735442?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Letty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0950935/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rick Yune"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0232500/characters/nm0950935?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Johnny Tran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0835001/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Johnny Strong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0232500/characters/nm0835001?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Leon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0505971/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ted Levine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0232500/characters/nm0505971?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sgt.

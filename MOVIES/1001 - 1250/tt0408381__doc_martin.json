Some dedicated viewers really don't understand why they are so hooked! So I shall tell them why they love Doc Martin. Doc Martin is real. I am a registered nurse and have worked in the Operating Room (theater, if you are picky) and I can tell you this man exists. That is why I switched to the Medical Floor, to get away from the Doc Martins of the hospital. Good grief, they are intimidating. It takes years to find out how weak and vulnerable and sad they are. When a patient codes and doesn't make it, the Doc Martins of the world are left to handle their grief and feelings alone. Isn't that sad? We notice (and love) Doc Martin first of all because he oozes alpha male chemistry and we react to that with a mixture of love and hate, contempt and admiration. We love him second of all because he has transcended most of his feelings (unlike us) and has moved to a higher plane of capability because of it and we benefit from his capability and confidence. We love him thirdly because he needs our love and he has been so mistreated and has such voids within him. There are all kind of subtle clues that Doc Martin is wonderful, but none so telling as the fact that dogs love him and are not impressed by his screams and sneers. You cannot fool a dog! Why does America love this series so much? Because the British do a much finer job than we do at so many many film endeavors. From the impeccable casting to the brilliant writing and believable dialogue to the ability the British have to plumb the depths and soar the heights of human drama and comedy without having holes and gaps that need filled with obscenity or worse. Thanks to the British for their genius. They are even brilliant in the way they use color to match the characters to the environment and create an ambiance that disarms the viewer. I love British films and \"Doc Martin\" best of all. I suspect another reason America is enthralled with the Doc Martin series is because we Americans are having socialized medicine crammed down our unwilling throats, and watching socialized medicine in action adds a certain little touch of horror spice to the story that Brits probably do not even notice.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Doc Martin: Series 8", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2606414105", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU0NDQ5NTctYjJmOC00MmRjLWEwYzItYjNjYzllNTY2YWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU0NDQ5NTctYjJmOC00MmRjLWEwYzItYjNjYzllNTY2YWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Doc Martin: Season 8", "uploadDate": "2017-10-19T16:04:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167340/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Martin Clunes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0408381/characters/nm0167340?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Martin Ellingham"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2004-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0573862/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ian McNeice"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0408381/characters/nm0573862?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bert Large"}, {"url": "#", "name": "70 episodes, 2004-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0549855/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Marquez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0408381/characters/nm0549855?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "PC Joe Penhale"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 2007-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3353432/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jessica Ransom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0408381/characters/nm3353432?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Morwenna Newcross"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2004-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0146414/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Caroline Catz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0408381/characters/nm0146414?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Louisa Glasson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2004-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0009424/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joe Absolom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0408381/characters/nm0009424?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Al Large"}, {"url": "#", "name": "65 episodes, 2004-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0128135/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Selina Cadell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0408381/characters/nm0128135?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mrs. Tishell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2004-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0040586/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eileen Atkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0408381/characters/nm0040586?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ruth Ellingham"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2011-2019"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["1 January 2004 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Doc Martin"], "Filming Locations": ["Fern Cottage, Roscarrock Hill, Port Isaac, Cornwall, England, UK"], "Production Co": ["Buffalo Pictures", "Homerun Productions"], "Runtime": ["46 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

Unfortunately, this one was a huge mess.\n\nI love the way the first IT didn't want to be JUST a horror movie, but rather took time to build up a story, emotional connection. That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.\n\nThe worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.\n\nWhat I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.\n\nI guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT2H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi962640921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWFkY2MzMGUtMmMxYS00ZWU2LWE0NjMtYTcxNTNlYjIyODdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWFkY2MzMGUtMmMxYS00ZWU2LWE0NjMtYTcxNTNlYjIyODdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg", "description": "Twenty-seven years after the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, he has returned to terrorize the town of Derry once more.

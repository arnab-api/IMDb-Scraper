It was so funny, you must admire the emergency services scene! it was a total shame to have only 6 episodes in the 1 series! I hope series 2 comes out soon because this is by far the best series i have ever watched and will be my all-time favourite TV show ever! Moss is a great character and definitely suits the program well as his witty funny lines fits everywhere they are mentioned! \"If there were such a thing as a drudgeon, that is what we'd be to them.\" Class ;) The IT Crowd is A perfect 10/10 a must see.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The IT Crowd", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi81050905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDJjNzJlOTYtY2U0MC00MDE4LWIxNDgtMGIxMDcyODg0NTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDJjNzJlOTYtY2U0MC00MDE4LWIxNDgtMGIxMDcyODg0NTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The IT Crowd", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T09:03:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1483369/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris O'Dowd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0487831/characters/nm1483369?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roy Trenneman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2006-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1817670/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Katherine Parkinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0487831/characters/nm1817670?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jen Barber"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2006-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1547964/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Richard Ayoade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0487831/characters/nm1547964?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maurice Moss"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2006-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1546196/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Matt Berry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0487831/characters/nm1546196?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Douglas Reynholm"}, {"url": "#", "name": "17 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["3 February 2006 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The IT Crowd"], "Filming Locations": ["Thomas More Square, main building, Wapping, London, England, UK"], "Production Co": ["Talkback Thames", "Channel 4 Television Corporation"], "Runtime": ["25 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

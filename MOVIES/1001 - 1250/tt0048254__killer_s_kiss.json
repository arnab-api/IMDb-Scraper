He decided to go with Film-Noir.\n\nThe film is filled with Kubrick trademarks through and through.  He uses boxing (which was the subject of his very first short Day of the Fight [1951]), zooming techniques, flashbacks (also used in his next film The Killing [1956]) and narration.  The cinematography is exquisite, as usual, with many shots (particularly in the boxing studio and the train station) being backlit with a soft, grey light to give it a disconnected, almost rear-screen-projection feel.  However, it is obvious that this is the early, naive Kubrick at work here.  The entire movie, like Fear And Desire, is post-dubbed (much like a Fellini film), with all of the sound effects being done over by a meticulous Kubrick.  And, of course, the Film-Noir.  Davey Gordon (played to perfection by Jamie Smith) is the almost-stereotypical Noir anti-hero, with Irene Kane (aka journalist Chris Chase) as his anti-heroine.  Frank Silvera, who had the lead role in Fear And Desire, is the slimy villain, whom you actually want to die (a good sign [for a villain]).\n\nThis Kubrick film can most be compared to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) or Barry Lyndon (1975), in that, once you get past a slow beginning, the end is absolutely riveting.  Kubrick knows that he wants to grab his audience, and he does so with perfection.  Some of it is padded (the ballet sequence is not particular interest), but the rest it great, from the initial boxing sequence to the chase scene at the end.  If you're a fan of Kubrick, see it. If you're a fan of great cinema, see it.  If you're a fan of Film-Noir, see it (but take it with a pinch of salt).  If you're none of these things, see it, and you will be.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H7M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0798826/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frank Silvera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0798826?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vinnie Rapallo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0437325/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Irene Kane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0437325?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gloria Price"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0199073/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mike Dana"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0199073?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gangster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2204844/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Shaun O'Brien"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm2204844?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Landlord"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0891020/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "David Vaughan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0891020?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Conventioneer #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0731501/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ralph Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0731501?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bouncer #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0271001/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Arthur Feldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0271001?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Policeman #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011848/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Skippy Adelman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0011848?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mannequin Factory Owner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0808600/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jamie Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0808600?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Davey Gordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0418911/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jerry Jarrett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0418911?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Albert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0649939/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Felice Orlandi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0649939?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Main Gangster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0104440/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Barbara Brand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0104440?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Taxi Dance Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0748002/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alec Rubin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0748002?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Conventioneer #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2739995/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Phil Stevenson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm2739995?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bouncer #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0298587/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bill Funaro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0048254/characters/nm0298587?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Taxi Driver"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["1 October 1955 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Kiss Me, Kill Me"], "Filming Locations": ["3156 Perry Avenue, Bronx, New York City, New York, USA"], "Budget": ["$75,000", "(estimated)"], "Production Co": ["Minotaur Productions"], "Runtime": ["67 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Mono"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

Comics done right...", "reviewBody": "Went to a sneak preview of this movie today, and I was blown away. Over the years people have tried to emulate the feel of comics on the screen, and met with mild success(Dick Tracy), minor failure(Hulk), and solid success(Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow). This is hard to do, but Sin City hits this dead on. The film is entirely in black and white(Except for about 20 seconds that I noticed in one scene.), except for highlights of color(Gorgeous eyes, splattered blood, and red Converse All-Stars to name a few.). This gives the film a feel that immerses you into the storyline. Add to this the overly corny duologue and scenes where scantily(And I DO mean scantily) clad women pull Uzi's out of literally nowhere, and you have all the right makings for a transfer of a comic book to the screen. The duologue had me laughing almost constantly, but it's easy to tell that they wanted you to laugh, even when they lines were incredibly corny and melodramatic...\n\nThe performances in the movie were great as well. I believe my favorite male character was Marv, played by Micky Rourke, and my favorite female character was definitely Miho, played by Devon Aoki. It seems that everyone and their dog was either in this movie, or lent some of their talents to it, and it shows.\n\nI would definitely suggest that you see this in the theatre the very first time, because it will NEVER have the same impact on your TV at home as it does on a 30-foot screen in a dark theatre. I was actually able to note a few times where the digital cameras were able to outperform anything film could do.\n\nA lot of violence in this movie, although most of it is either totally cartoon-style, or off camera, and some gore as well... A good amount of nudity in the film, ALL of it on camera, so you'll probably want to leave the kiddies at home.\n\nAll in all, one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and I'll probably go see it again while it's in the theatres, so that my fianc\u00e9 can enjoy it as well...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sin City", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi667983385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ1YmQ4ZjItZWMyZS00YjUwLTgxYmUtODNhYmIwZWNjYzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ1YmQ4ZjItZWMyZS00YjUwLTgxYmUtODNhYmIwZWNjYzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:46:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004695/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jessica Alba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0401792/characters/nm0004695?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nancy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0088127/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alexis Bledel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0401792/characters/nm0088127?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Becky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1617514/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cara D.

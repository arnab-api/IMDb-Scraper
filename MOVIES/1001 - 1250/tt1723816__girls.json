So in a nutshell:\n\nI really dig this show. I think it has an extremely unique vibe to it, that kinda reminds me of \"How to make it in America\" (with a pinch of Woody Allen). It's nothing like \"Sex and the City\"... well it's about a group of Girlfriends, that happen to live in New York City and well... yes Sex is an issue. But still, it's nothing like \"SATC\". It's much more down-to-earth, realistic and... different. I like all the girls and their facets. The casting is great. Though they work with some (New York) clich\u00e9s in the show, I really have the feeling that I know people like that from my own life and experiences. The early 20s, an age where you're on your own for the first time of your life, grown up but still clueless about life and what to expect from it. It's kind of an adventure to figure out who you are, what you want and where to go. I really feel that \"GIRLS\" makes a great job capturing that feeling. Lena Dunham, creator, director and protagonist of this show is crazy talented. People will hear (even more) from her in the future. Mark my words.\n\nHopefully HBO won't axe this show as they did with \"How to make it...\". It's a great show and I really enjoy watching it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2586031641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MzIyNDMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU4NTcwMTI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4MzIyNDMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU4NTcwMTI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Write the final chapter: Watch the Season 6 trailer for \"Girls\"", "uploadDate": "2017-01-10T04:48:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2501633/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lena Dunham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723816/characters/nm2501633?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hannah Horvath"}, {"url": "#", "name": "62 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3733434/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jemima Kirke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723816/characters/nm3733434?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jessa Johansson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "53 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0541082/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Zosia Mamet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723816/characters/nm0541082?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Shoshanna Shapiro"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0710330/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Andrew Rannells"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723816/characters/nm0710330?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Elijah Krantz"}, {"url": "#", "name": "35 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4129745/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Allison Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723816/characters/nm4129745?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marnie Michaels"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3485845/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Adam Driver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723816/characters/nm3485845?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Adam Sackler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1493163/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alex Karpovsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723816/characters/nm1493163?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ray Ploshansky"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0609114/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ebon Moss-Bachrach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723816/characters/nm0609114?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Desi Harperin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["15 April 2012 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Girls"], "Filming Locations": ["New York Bay, New York, USA"], "Production Co": ["Apatow Productions"], "Runtime": ["28 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

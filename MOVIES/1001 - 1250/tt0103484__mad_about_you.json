I used to be a hopeless romantic, and I used to watch this show hoping that someday my life would turn out like this show. I wanted to meet that special someone in some quirky way, have actual friends who were also couples. Have dinners and go places and talk about inconsequential things like where to place a couch. - Well that never happened. But at least I still have the show! - I watched this show when it aired. I joined the internet message board for this show back when the internet was invented (go ahead - try to find it - it still exists!). I bought the VHS copies. I bought the book (What's your Mad About You IQ?). I bought the DVDs. I bought more DVDs on eBay. I got the complete series on DVD last year. I'm a fan. I'm a huge fan. I'm a fan from the way back. - This show was amazing. The actors, the cadence of the speaking parts, the dog, the sets, the plots, the drama, the lack of drama, the guest stars, all of it just still resonates with me and is a part of me to this day. Oh - and the HEART. This show had heart in spades. - Did you know there's an excellent Podcast about this show? It's called \"Mad About Mad About You\" and I highly recommend it! Seriously go check it out now wherever you kids these days do podcast things. Thank me later. - If you've never seen the show, you are doing yourself an incredible disservice. It is hands-down my absolute favorite TV show of all time!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mad About You: Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi320059929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRlMTdjMGQtZWE5Ni00ODRiLTgzNmYtZWMwNTVhZjI4Njg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRlMTdjMGQtZWE5Ni00ODRiLTgzNmYtZWMwNTVhZjI4Njg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Series Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-01-11T17:20:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001663/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Reiser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103484/characters/nm0001663?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Buchman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "174 episodes, 1992-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0659601/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Pankow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103484/characters/nm0659601?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ira Buchman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "152 episodes, 1993-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0708867/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anne Ramsay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103484/characters/nm0708867?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lisa Stemple"}, {"url": "#", "name": "130 episodes, 1992-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364576/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cynthia Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103484/characters/nm0364576?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sylvia Buchman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "81 episodes, 1993-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000166/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Helen Hunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103484/characters/nm0000166?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jamie Stemple Buchman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "174 episodes, 1992-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005087/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Leila Kenzle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103484/characters/nm0005087?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Fran Devanow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 1992-1999"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1214446/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maui"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103484/characters/nm1214446?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Murray"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 1992-1999"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0957922/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Louis Zorich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0103484/characters/nm0957922?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Burt Buchman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "70 episodes, 1993-1999"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["23 September 1992 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Mad About You"], "Filming Locations": ["Old Town Bar and Restaurant, 45 E. 18th Street in Flatiron District, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA"], "Production Co": ["Comedy Dynamics", "In Front Productions", "Nuance Productions"], "Runtime": ["22 min", "(164 episodes)"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "Dolby"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

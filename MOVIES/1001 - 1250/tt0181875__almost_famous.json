Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical story of an aspiring rock journalist who goes on tour with a band in the 1970's. If it sounds familiar, it's probably because the story is hardly new. There have been dozens of movies made about the rock and roll lifestyle: the drugs, the sex, the fights, and all the bumps on the road to success.\n\nSo what sets Almost Famous apart? The acting, for one. Frances McDormand was brilliant as William's (newcomer Patrick Fugit) well-meaning but overbearing mother. Fugit, for his part, had a convincing performance as the shy, awkward teenager struggling to be a journalist but at the same time aching to belong. Kate Hudson, in her breakout role as groupie \"Penny Lane\", gave her character depth beyond what might have been a limiting role. And Billy Crudup, as band Stillwater's charismatic lead guitarist, shines. Jason Lee is always good, and as Stillwater's lead singer, this role is no exception. And I can't review this film without giving a shout-out to the chronically and criminally-underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in with his portrayal of legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs.\n\nThe writing in the film also contributes to its effect. Many of the great lines belong to McDormand but there are plenty of others to go around. In addition, the music of the era can't be beat. Everything from Simon and Garfunkle to Alvin and the Chipmunks shows up at some point in the movie's extensive musical score.\n\nThe plot may not be particularly original, but it rings true. I of course am approaching this review as a music fan and someone interested in the industry. Nonetheless, I believe that even people who couldn't care less about rock music will enjoy this movie, since it's not so much about the music as it is about life. A central theme is the conflict of William: Should he remain a detached but lonely outsider so as to be an impartial journalist, or allow himself to make friends with these people and feel like he belongs? Aside from bringing up questions of journalistic ethics, this dilemma mirrors much of what people in all wakes of life deal with daily.\n\nAlmost Famous is realistic, funny, touching, and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you've gained something just for having seen it. It's too bad that they say rock and roll is dead, cause we could sure use more movies like this one!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Almost Famous", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2943458841", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTRmOGU3MjktN2I2OC00OWRiLWI5ZWQtNWYzMjVlMzM5MTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTRmOGU3MjktN2I2OC00OWRiLWI5ZWQtNWYzMjVlMzM5MTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks", "uploadDate": "2011-12-01T06:05:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001082/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Billy Crudup"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0001082?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Russell Hammond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005028/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kate Hudson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0005028?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Penny Lane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0297578/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patrick Fugit"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0297578?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "William Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0029400/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Angarano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0029400?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Young William"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000103/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Fairuza Balk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0000103?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sapphire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0270152/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John Fedevich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0270152?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ed Vallencourt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000450/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Philip Seymour Hoffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0000450?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lester Bangs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0266422/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jimmy Fallon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0266422?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dennis Hope"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000531/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Frances McDormand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0000531?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Elaine Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005134/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jason Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0005134?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jeff Bebe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0221046/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Zooey Deschanel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0221046?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anita Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001593/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Anna Paquin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0001593?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Polexia Aphrodisia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0852965/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Noah Taylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0852965?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dick Roswell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0468820/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mark Kozelek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0468820?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Larry Fellows"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005459/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Liz Stauber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0181875/characters/nm0005459?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Leslie"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "French"], "Release Date": ["22 September 2000 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Uncool"], "Filming Locations": ["Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - 7000 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$60,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$2,314,646,", "17 September 2000"], "Gross USA": ["$32,534,850"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$47,385,836"], "Production Co": ["Columbia Pictures", "Dreamworks Pictures", "Vinyl Films"], "Runtime": ["122 min", "162 min", "(director's cut)", "152 min", "(DVD extended cut)"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

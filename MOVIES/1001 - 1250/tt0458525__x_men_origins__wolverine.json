I have read X-Men comics in my past, but it's been years. I don't remember every detail of every relationship and back story, so I'm not a huge X-men expert. I LOVED the original X-Men movie and X2.\n\nI was so excited when I heard they were making a Wolverine movie. He and Gambit were my two favorite characters from the comics, and Wolverine was by far the best written and one of the best acted characters in the X-Men franchise. I thought, \"This should be good!\" I counted down the days until it came out. And I went to the theatre, and came out not disappointed, but not excited either. It was a middle-of-the-road movie, which seemed to not know what it wanted to be. But I would say go see it if you're an X-Men or Hugh Jackman fan.\n\nThe main crime committed in Wolverine is in the writing. I always say writers don't get enough credit on a good movie. But no amount of good acting (pretty much everyone in Wolverine does well with what they're given) and okay directing can cover up crappy writing like this. The script was all over the place. It didn't have any of the jaunty yet edgy feel of the first two X-Men movies. Wolverine's wisecracks and smart wit were all but forgotten. That would've maybe been okay if they had chosen to make Wolverine the dark, nearly evil character that he was supposed to have been before he lost his memory. But they didn't. He was neither good nor evil. This was ambivalent Wolverine. Kind of Emo Wolverine. Not above doing bad, but not really into it because it made him Feel Bad. No really interesting lines or plot points either way. The writers didn't seem to even know how to develop the relationship between Wolverine and Sabertooth. And was the love story put in by the studio just to satisfy us chicks who wouldn't go a see a comic-book movie without it? If so, the studio did us a great disservice, because if you wanted to make a story about Wolverine the lover (which, hey, I would go see), this movie wasn't that either. \n\nAnd when I saw in the trailer that Gambit was in the movie, too, I was thrilled! Gambit in a movie, at last! But here he is, the underdeveloped and kind of confusing Gambit. Couldn't he at least have had his New Orleans accent? The cards were cool, but he was mostly underutilized and didn't feel like Gambit that much.\n\nThe movie does have some good moments in it where you actually say, \"Yes!\" I'm not putting spoilers, so I won't tell you what they are, but for me, they made the movie worth seeing. While I wouldn't put it anywhere on my worst-movie list, I wouldn't rank it with X-Men and X2 on my favorites list, either.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "X-Men Origins: Wolverine -- Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi520356633", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MTY1ODYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAyMTkzMg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MTY1ODYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAyMTkzMg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An origins story that chronicles the early life of James Howlett (Jackman) and his relationship and eventual falling out with Victor Creed/Sabretooth (Schreiber), and his fateful entry into the Weapons X project.", "uploadDate": "2009-03-10T14:39:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413168/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hugh Jackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0413168?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Logan"}, {"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0413168?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Wolverine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396812/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Danny Huston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0396812?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stryker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1211488/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lynn Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm1211488?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kayla Silverfox"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597480/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dominic Monaghan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0597480?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Bradley"}, {"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0597480?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bolt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2024644/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Daniel Henney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm2024644?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Agent Zero"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2992710/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tim Pocock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm2992710?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Scott Summers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0191504/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Max Cullen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0191504?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Travis Hudson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3111353/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael-James Olsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm3111353?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Young Victor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000630/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Liev Schreiber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0000630?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Victor Creed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1443238/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Will.i.am"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm1443238?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John Wraith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0243806/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kevin Durand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0243806?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fred Dukes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2018237/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Taylor Kitsch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm2018237?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Remy LeBeau"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005351/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ryan Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Wade Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0086611/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Julia Blake"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm0086611?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Heather Hudson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2931989/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Troye Sivan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0458525/characters/nm2931989?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "James"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["1 May 2009 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Wolverine"], "Filming Locations": ["Auburn, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia"], "Budget": ["$150,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$85,058,003,", "3 May 2009"], "Gross USA": ["$179,883,157"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$373,062,864"], "Production Co": ["Twentieth Century Fox", "Marvel Enterprises", "Dune Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["107 min", "119 min", "(extended cut)"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

I mean, the plot is not supposed to be plausible, it's supposed to be comedy, and a feel good show, and that's exactly what it is, with a little cynical twist added from Kat Dennings. Kat Dennings run the show, and she is the main reason I follow this series. For people who like Kat Dennings kind of humor, this is a show for you, where she gets to play a little more freely with her puns than she has been able to do previously in movies and other shows. I love it!It might not be a very popular show, like Glee or all these other vampire shows that people are into now, but that's why I like it, it's plain and simple, back to old school stories of the rich and the poor, but I'm not gonna be surprised if this is one of those shows that aren't gonna be around for long since it's not main stream popular. It's a shame if it wont last.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "2 Broke Girls: The Complete Second Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1094496793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc4ZGNmODItMDdlYi00NWFhLThjNjAtY2Y2ZjU3YWZiZjJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc4ZGNmODItMDdlYi00NWFhLThjNjAtY2Y2ZjU3YWZiZjJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for 2 Broke Girls: The Complete Second Season", "uploadDate": "2015-12-13T07:01:34Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0993507/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kat Dennings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1845307/characters/nm0993507?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Max Black"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0606541/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Garrett Morris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1845307/characters/nm0606541?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Earl"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3211555/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Matthew Moy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1845307/characters/nm3211555?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Han Lee"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3396631/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Beth Behrs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1845307/characters/nm3396631?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Caroline Channing"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1745277/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jonathan Kite"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1845307/characters/nm1745277?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Oleg"}, {"url": "#", "name": "138 episodes, 2011-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177639/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jennifer Coolidge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1845307/characters/nm0177639?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sophie Kachinsky"}, {"url": "#", "name": "124 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Korean", "Yiddish", "Hebrew", "Spanish", "Arabic", "Ukrainian"], "Release Date": ["19 September 2011 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Two Broke Girls"], "Filming Locations": ["Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Michael Patrick King Productions", "Warner Bros.

Because comedies generally try to do nothing other than make you laugh, it's easier to let plot and character development (etc) slide, as you might not with other genres of movies. This is the typical R rated comedy of this day and age - over the top, raunchy comedy that focuses mostly on human anatomy jokes. If you hate those movies, avoid it at all costs. If you like them, then you'll probably like this. \n\nAt the screening I saw this at just about everyone after the film was talking about how they liked it, and there was certainly a lot of laughter in the theater throughout the movie. \n\nThis movie had a few moments of truly laugh out loud hilarity, outside of those few moments the rest of the comedy was there, but it was pretty generic.\n\nLook, you know what type of movie this is (raunchy comedy).

Playing a talented but dysfunctional writer in the middle of a mid-life crisis, Duchovny's character is spot on. He can't pass a whiskey glass or a skirt and they even throw in a Porche for him to drive, in case your mind drifts. Only this is his mid-life crisis so we can laugh at it. It's OK. Natascha McElhone, having survived the Hungarian Revolution on The Company, gets to do something fun this time. This is good. She's both talented and HOT! \n\nI laughed pretty much through the entire first episode and I'm looking forward to just how badly Moody...yeah, a guy having a mid-life crisis named Moody...can screw up his life this season.\n\nI am so IN!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Californication: The Third Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2489817369", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjlhYWViY2QtM2FiNS00ODA2LWFkMzYtNTMzNGJjNzdhYWFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjlhYWViY2QtM2FiNS00ODA2LWFkMzYtNTMzNGJjNzdhYWFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Californication: The Third Season", "uploadDate": "2010-11-07T03:06:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000141/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Duchovny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0904208/characters/nm0000141?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hank Moody"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 2007-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0359577/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Evan Handler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0904208/characters/nm0359577?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charlie Runkle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 2007-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1502383/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Madeleine Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0904208/characters/nm1502383?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Becca Moody"}, {"url": "#", "name": "73 episodes, 2007-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001523/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Natascha McElhone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0904208/characters/nm0001523?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Karen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 2007-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0781899/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pamela Adlon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0904208/characters/nm0781899?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Marcy Runkle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2007-2014"}]}]}

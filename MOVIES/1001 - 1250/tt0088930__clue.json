Based off of the famous board game, Clue is a fantastic movie for people of all ages. I, myself, was drawn to this movie at the age of seven or eight, and it has faithfully been my favorite movie ever since!\n\nThe movie starts with six guests (Mr. Green, Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum, Miss. Scarlet, Mrs. White, and Mrs. Peacock) all being invited to a large mansion in New England for a dinner party, of which they know absolutely nothing about. At the party they all find out that they have more in common than they first realized, and the murders begin, starting with Mr. Boddy, the seventh guest! And as the night goes on, suspicion lands on each of the guests, as well as the butler Wadsworth. So not only is the movie uproarious, but it's actually a very intriguing mystery!\n\nThe acting is absolutely spot on in Clue! Eileen Brennan plays Mrs. Peacock, a talkative politician's wife. Madeline Kahn is Mrs. White, my favorite character in the movie! Mrs. White is a widow who may have more to do with her husband's death than she's letting on! Christopher Lloyd does a terrific job as Professor Plum, the ladies man wannabe! Michael McKean plays the hopelessly clumsy Mr. Green. Martin Mull is Colonel Mustard, the man who tries to act as if he knows exactly what is going on. Lesley Ann Warren is awesome as Miss. Scarlet the temptress, and of course you can not forget the amazing Tim Curry who plays cool and composed Wadsworth, the butler.\n\nAs I said before, this is a movie for people of all ages. In fact, just recently I got my six-year-old brother to watch it, and he too claims it is his favorite movie! Does he understand every single joke? No, of course not! But the upbeat, fast pace of the movie has him watching it over and over, and acting out the famous \"Wadsworth Explains Everything\" scene! I fully recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a good laugh and tons of fun!"}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Clue", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4206756121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhhM2NlYzYtZTAwNi00MDU3LWFlOTgtMDY3YTY5Mzg2ZTZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhhM2NlYzYtZTAwNi00MDU3LWFlOTgtMDY3YTY5Mzg2ZTZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Paramount", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:28:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0107281/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eileen Brennan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0107281?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mrs. Peacock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001404/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Madeline Kahn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0001404?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mrs. White"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0571106/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael McKean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0571106?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mr. Green"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000690/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lesley Ann Warren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0000690?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Miss Scarlet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0898962/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lee Ving"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0898962?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Boddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005553/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jane Wiedlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0005553?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "The Singing Telegram Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0619990/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kellye Nakahara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0619990?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "The Cook"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0325891/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rick Goldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0325891?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cop #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000347/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tim Curry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0000347?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wadsworth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000502/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Christopher Lloyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0000502?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Professor Plum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0611898/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Martin Mull"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0611898?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Colonel Mustard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0131974/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Colleen Camp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0131974?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Yvette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0376347/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bill Henderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0376347?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "The Cop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0469552/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jeffrey Kramer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0469552?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "The Motorist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0638593/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Will Nye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088930/characters/nm0638593?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Cop #1"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "French"], "Release Date": ["13 December 1985 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Clue: The Movie"], "Filming Locations": ["Paramount Studios - 5555 Melrose Avenue, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$15,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$2,014,166,", "15 December 1985"], "Gross USA": ["$14,643,997"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$14,643,997"], "Production Co": ["Paramount Pictures", "The Guber-Peters Company", "PolyGram Filmed Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["94 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Mono"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

Jack (Tom Cruise , though Johnny Depp, Robert Downey Jr. and Jim Carrey were all considered for this character) and his partners such as Screwball (Billy Barty) , Blunder (Kiran Shah) and Gump (David Bennet , recently his Tin Drum) are disposed to do everything to save the world and rescue princess Lili (Mia Sara) who Darkness intends to make his wife from the hands of this evil devil . A young man must stop the Lord of Darkness , the personification of evil , from both destroying daylight and marrying the young girl (Mia Sara was only 15 during the filming of Legend , she was actually born in 1967, so she was 15 in 1982, which is when production for the film began) he loves . There appears demons , Elfs , Unicorns , fairy , and goblin as Blix (played by Alice Playten whose face was designed after that of Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones) . As Darkness (Ridley Scott was inspired to cast Tim Curry as Darkness after seeing The Rocky Horror Picture Show , he had also considered casting Richard O'Brien as Meg Mucklebones) plans to spread eternal night in the land where this tale takes place , by killing every unicorn (the sound of the unicorns at play is actually a recording of humpback whales) in Earth .\n\nThis breathtaking film contains imagination , magic , thrills , fantasy , adventure and many other things . This is an incredible fantastic movie which features elves , fairies , dwarfs and other mythical creatures . Ridley Scott drew most of his inspiration for \"Legend\" from the 1946 version of \u00a8Belle and the Beast\u00a8, as well as such Disney animated classics as \u00a8Snow White\u00a8 , \u00a8Fantasy\u00a8 and \u00a8Bambi\u00a8. Impressive production , the production was filmed on the Pinewood Studio sound stage that had been originally created for \u00a8The spy who loved me\u00a8 . However , filming was interrupted twice, firstly by the studio burning to the ground and secondly, by the death of Tom Cruise's father. Composer Jerry Goldsmith's original score was removed by the studio after the first round of test screenings. In an effort to appeal to \"the kids\", executives commissioned Tangerine Dream to create a replacement. Until 2002, Goldsmith's original score was heard only with the film's European release. Special mention to brilliant and colorful cinematography by Alex Thomson .\n\nRidley Scott admits that comments made by some pot-smoking attendees at a screening got the director second-guessing himself, and influenced him to cut the film from 150 minutes to 98. The director's cut reveals an alternative ending where Jack remains in the forest and Lily goes home alone with plans to see him again soon. The motion picture was marvelous and glamorously directed by Ridley Scott , at his best and as stylish as ever , similarly his previous film \u00a8Someone to watch over me\u00a8 and others as \u00a8Blade runner\u00a8, \u00a8Black rain\u00a8 , in which his visual style is impressive as well as his speciality ,the historical genre , as \u00a8Robin Hood\u00a8 , \u00a8Kingdom of heaven\u00a8 , \u00a8Duelists\u00a8 and \u00a8Black Hawk down\u00a8 . Rating : Above average . Essential and indispensable watching for Ridley Scott followers", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Legend (1985)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4120183065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRkYjhlMzAtMWI5Yi00MjM4LThiZGUtNzc1Nzk3MDIwNTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRkYjhlMzAtMWI5Yi00MjM4LThiZGUtNzc1Nzk3MDIwNTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:59:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000129/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Cruise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0000129?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000347/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tim Curry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0000347?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Darkness"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0687029/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alice Playten"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0687029?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Blix"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0399155/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cork Hubbert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0399155?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brown Tom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0787449/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kiran Shah"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0787449?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Blunder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000585/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Robert Picardo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0000585?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Meg Mucklebones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519396/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ian Longmur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0519396?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Demon Cook"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0318151/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Liz Gilbert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0318151?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dancing Black Dress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000214/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mia Sara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0000214?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lili"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000908/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "David Bennent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0000908?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gump"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000863/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Billy Barty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0000863?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Screwball"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640990/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter O'Farrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0640990?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Pox"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0487261/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Annabelle Lanyon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0487261?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Oona"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0387525/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tina Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0387525?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186400/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Michael Crane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089469/characters/nm0186400?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Demon Cook"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "UK"], "Language": ["English", "Italian"], "Release Date": ["18 April 1986 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Legend"], "Filming Locations": ["Agnes Scott College - 141 E.

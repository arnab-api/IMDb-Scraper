When the worst of the perpetrators cops a plea and is back out on the streets after a mere three years behind bars, Clyde is forced to take matters into his own hands. But he isn't content merely to bring down the killers themselves but to systematically go after everyone in the legal system \u2013 from strict-constructionist judges to hamstrung attorneys - who helped facilitate the injustice. That's where Nick Rice, well played by Jamie Foxx, comes in, the decent but by-the-book prosecutor who helped set up the deal and has now, along with everyone else involved with the case, become a prime target for Clyde's take-no-prisoners reign of terror and retribution.\n\nThe one thing that distinguishes \"Law Abiding Citizen\" from similar films in the genre is that it's not afraid to have a deeply troubled, possibly even psychotic, character at its core. For Clyde does not fit the mold of the typically lovable antihero. The audience is, in the early stages at least, asked to root him on as a conventional Angel of Retribution dispensing the justice that the court system saw fit to deny him, but so much of what he winds up doing steps so far over the line that we eventually balk at his tactics. It's this moral ambiguity that helps to mitigate some of the implausibility of Kurt Wimmer's screenplay, which often goes for effect at the expense of credibility. Indeed the movie's insistence at making him a sort of omnipotent, omnipresent existential force of nature to be reckoned with takes the movie out of the realm of reality and cheapens some of what it is trying to do. And, in the process of reaching its climax, the movie takes a plot turn so ludicrous and credibility-defying that the whole thing pretty much crashes and burns at the end.\n\nThat being said, Nick's interactions with Clyde are fun to watch and, thanks to taut direction by F. Gary Gray, there are some moments of genuine suspense scattered along the way. So if you can put your skepticism and critical-thinking skills on hold for the duration, you can have a pretty decent time with \"Law Abiding Citizen.\"", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Law Abiding Citizen: \"Don't Even Twitch\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1598816793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MDQ2MTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk2ODA5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MDQ2MTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk2ODA5Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A clip from the movie Law Abiding Citizen.", "uploadDate": "2009-10-15T13:30:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004937/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jamie Foxx"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0004937?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nick Rice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000538/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Colm Meaney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0000538?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Detective Dunnigan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004753/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Leslie Bibb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0004753?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sarah Lowell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411857/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gregory Itzin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0411857?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Warden Iger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2986062/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Emerald-Angel Young"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm2986062?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Denise Rice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179960/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Annie Corley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0179960?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Judge Laura Burch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0205626/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Viola Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0205626?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mayor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1577637/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Josh Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm1577637?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rupert Ames"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124930/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gerard Butler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0124930?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Clyde Shelton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569226/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bruce McGill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0569226?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jonas Cantrell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0409831/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Irby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0409831?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Detective Garza"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0356021/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Regina Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0356021?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kelly Rice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0831601/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Christian Stolte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0831601?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Clarence Darby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0692466/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Richard Portnow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0692466?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bill Reynolds"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0446672/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Michael Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1197624/characters/nm0446672?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bray"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["16 October 2009 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Law Abiding Citizen"], "Filming Locations": ["Girard Point, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA"], "Budget": ["$50,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$21,039,502,", "18 October 2009"], "Gross USA": ["$73,357,727"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$127,944,208"], "Production Co": ["G-BASE", "The Film Department", "Warp Films"], "Runtime": ["109 min", "118 min", "(director's cut)"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "DTS", "SDDS", "Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

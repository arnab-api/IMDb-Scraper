One of the most overused element in cinema and often mis-used and unnecessary. I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used sex scene could make the movie feels cheap. \n\nThis movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all other elements that were done well in the movie.\n\nThematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple elegant design.\n\nThe story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.\n\nThe music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable. The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add everything together.\n\nIt isn't a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved here and there. The last part was also a small disappointment for myself. But it is a damn unique movie that you have to watch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Handmaiden", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3452614681", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2NDk5ODktNWQ3Zi00N2RkLWEwZWYtYTMyYWNmOGIyN2FkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2NDk5ODktNWQ3Zi00N2RkLWEwZWYtYTMyYWNmOGIyN2FkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Handmaiden", "uploadDate": "2018-02-17T17:15:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3892241/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kim Tae-ri"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm3892241?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sook-Hee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8621196/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Min-chae Yoo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm8621196?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ggeut-dan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1390122/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kim Hae-sook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm1390122?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Miss Sasaki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1978402/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jung-woo Ha"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm1978402?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Count Fujiwara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7955709/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Si-eun Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm7955709?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Maid 2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1133320/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rina Takagi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm1133320?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hideko's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3796951/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Geun-hee Won"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm3796951?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Butler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12214775/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Han-sun Jang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm12214775?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kouzuki Porter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1079857/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Yong-nyeo Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm1079857?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bok-soon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6771561/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dong-hwi Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm6771561?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Goo-gai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1195119/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kim Min-hee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm1195119?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lady Hideko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8621199/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kyu-jung Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm8621199?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Maid 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8621200/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Si-yeon Ha"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm8621200?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maid 3"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2437361/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cho Jin-woong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm2437361?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Uncle Kouzuki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8129612/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jong-Dae Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4016934/characters/nm8129612?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mansion Driver"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["South Korea"], "Language": ["Korean", "Japanese"], "Release Date": ["1 June 2016 (South Korea)"], "Also Known As": ["The Handmaiden"], "Filming Locations": ["Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"], "Budget": ["KRW10,000,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$92,129,", "23 October 2016"], "Gross USA": ["$2,006,788"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$37,767,206"], "Production Co": ["CJ Entertainment", "Moho Film", "Yong Film"], "Runtime": ["145 min", "168 min", "(extended)"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Dolby Atmos", "Dolby Surround 7.1"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

They had everything-action, women in bikinis, bad guys, cool cars, they had the lot.\n\nIn my opinion, this series was Tom Selleck's finest hour. Magnum P.I. lived in a mansion in Hawaii where he had to put up with Higgins who was looking after the house for Mr. Masters. Both had respect for each other obviously but they were always getting on each other's nerves and Magnum also had to put up with two dogs-Zeus and Apollo if my memory serves me correctly-who didn't like him at all.\n\nOf course, like most 80's heroes Magnum had a cool car which he used to parade around Hawaii solving all types of cases involving crooks both small-time and big time. Magnum used to investigate the cases and then engage in a good old fight at the end.\n\nAll in all, a good show. And who can forget Magnum's shirts?"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Magnum, P.I.: The Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2657854233", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUxZTI0YzktZWYyYi00MGE2LTg5YmUtNDllMGRlYWZjNGM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQWplbmNvbGo@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUxZTI0YzktZWYyYi00MGE2LTg5YmUtNDllMGRlYWZjNGM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQWplbmNvbGo@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Magnum P.I.: The Complete Series", "uploadDate": "2012-04-29T03:21:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000633/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Selleck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0080240/characters/nm0000633?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Magnum"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 1980-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0608853/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Roger E.

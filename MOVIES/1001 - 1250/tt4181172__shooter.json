It has to hit. That is the new reality in TV. There are just too many options. That said, hang in there. The pilot was not Mr Robot. That was one of the best pilots ever. \n\nI was going to bail but recorded the series on DVR and episode 3 hit the target! That was good TV. I want to see a loner trying to evade getting caught. This is The Fugitive w/great gun skills. \n\nI was critical of trying to recreate the movie and how this would be done. I did not like the female FBI agent casting at first. It was political (black female), but the actress (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) pulled it off. Her acting skill changed my mind. The little girl is excellent as well. Casting is everything. I am still not convinced about the lead of FBI agent (Isaac Johnson) role. New face, but in TV that face needs to convince the audience immediately they are who they are. All to say when his scenes take place, I disconnect just a bit. Same with Ryan Phillippe. I wasn't sold on him, but he plays the role as needed. I think because they play the Bourne movies non-stop, I/we are tired of Mr Everything, the persona of someone who is a rebel (detached from his core unit) but super skilled in every way, able to out think law enforcement at will, a McGyver ability to escape any place at any time. This is old news today. Stallone perfected this in Rambo. It is 2016. Time to re-think this role.\n\nI hope this series remains highly intelligent. There is no excuse for stupid. It all comes down to production and storytelling. Timing and pace. Music that connects. \n\nFor myself, I like specific scenes. I loved the mini-mart scene is Ep 3 and how it was performed. Producers should ask the audience what scenes they rewound their DVR's at--that scene you had to see over again. Again, no excuses today for not doing your homework! All you have to do is recreate the greatest scenes from similar genres. Make them your own, but find those \"gold\" moments and give them to us.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi466401561", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE1MDM0N2ItMWE1MS00MjQ5LTg4NWUtYzNhZDA5ZmI4NjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgzNjU0ODU@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE1MDM0N2ItMWE1MS00MjQ5LTg4NWUtYzNhZDA5ZmI4NjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgzNjU0ODU@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 2 trailer", "uploadDate": "2017-07-18T19:08:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000202/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Phillippe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4181172/characters/nm0000202?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bob Lee Swagger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1870963/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cynthia Addai-Robinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4181172/characters/nm1870963?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nadine Memphis"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7652057/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lexy Kolker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4181172/characters/nm7652057?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mary Swagger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2754138/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Matt Shallenberger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4181172/characters/nm2754138?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Wheeler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 2017-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1416900/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Shantel VanSanten"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4181172/characters/nm1416900?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Julie Swagger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004898/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Omar Epps"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4181172/characters/nm0004898?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Isaac Johnson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103038/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jesse Bradford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4181172/characters/nm0103038?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Harris Downey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "17 episodes, 2017-2018"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["15 November 2016 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Shooter"], "Filming Locations": ["Santa Clarita, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Closest to the Hole Productions"], "Runtime": ["60 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

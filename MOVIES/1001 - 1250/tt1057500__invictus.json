There was the bitter experience that white South Africans saw in their neighboring countries,i.e., Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and other nations where the White colonialist had been replaced by Black African politicians and a stable government had been replaced by corrupt, self-serving regimes where those in power feathered their nests after seizing the assets of their former White citizens and placed all their friends in positions of authority with the result of the country going to the dogs. The scene where the Afrikaaner newspaper remarks, \"Mendela can get elected but can he run a country,\" and the superb Morgan Freeman remarks to his bodyguard that the headline raises a good point.\n\nIn a sense, this film is about Mandela. The rugby team becomes a metaphor of what he faced when ascending to the presidency, a nation divided. Noting that the Black South Africans were cheering for the opposition in the face of the old Apartheid guard whose love of rugby unified them. It's easy to forget that there was a great division among White South Africans, i.e., the descendants of the Boers, Afrikaaners, and the rest. There was even a middle ground with the \"Coloreds,\" Asian South Africans, being caught between these two worlds and there were bitter rivalries among the competing African political interest groups as well.\n\nMandela's focus on reviving the national rugby team and making it a symbol of a new united nation homes in on the role of Matt Damon, an Afrikaaner who's the captain of the team. Francois is the catalyst that makes this story work and Damon, the rugged Mick from Boston, does a fantastic job showing the transition from hopelessness to hope as many White South Africans felt at that time. The wonderful thing about this film is its touching on all the levels. It goes beyond being merely the story of a single man or group of men. Sure, we love a \"feel good\" movie and of course we love an \"underdog can win\" flick, but this film works works because its about people working together to rebuild something new for everybody.\n\nThe film reeks with great moments: Pienaar visiting the cell where Mandela spent more than 20 years of his life, thinking and planning; The New Zealand Rugby team doing their Maori threat dance before the match; the jet buzzing the field before the game-- and so on. See it. Enjoy it. And, don't forget, it's a bit of history. Romanticized? Somewhat. Mandela wasn't able to solve all of South Africa's big problems, but he did one bang-up job for the Springboks.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H14M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Invictus", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1889666329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMTI5ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkxOTg4MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMTI5ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkxOTg4MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A look at life for Nelson Mandela after the fall of apartheid in South Africa during his first term as president when campaigned to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup event as an opportunity to unite his countrymen.", "uploadDate": "2009-10-29T15:21:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000151/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Morgan Freeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0000151?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nelson Mandela"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0450961/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tony Kgoroge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0450961?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Tshabalala"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1340604/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Matt Stern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm1340604?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hendrick Booyens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0027957/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Adjoa Andoh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0027957?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brenda Mazibuko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0452009/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Leleti Khumalo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0452009?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236069/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Penny Downie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0236069?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Pienaar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1973790/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bonnie Mbuli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm1973790?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Zindzi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3227023/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Louis Minnaar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm3227023?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Springbok Coach"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000354/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matt Damon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0000354?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Francois Pienaar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0595680/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Patrick Mofokeng"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0595680?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Linga Moonsamy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428484/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Julian Lewis Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0428484?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Etienne Feyder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3325268/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Marguerite Wheatley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm3325268?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nerine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0529300/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Patrick Lyster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm0529300?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mr. Pienaar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3705791/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sibongile Nojila"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm3705791?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Eunice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3206284/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Shakes Myeko"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1057500/characters/nm3206284?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Minister of Sport"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Afrikaans", "Maori", "Zulu", "Xhosa", "Southern Sotho"], "Release Date": ["11 December 2009 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Human Factor"], "Filming Locations": ["South Africa"], "Budget": ["$60,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$8,611,147,", "13 December 2009"], "Gross USA": ["$37,491,364"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$122,426,792"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Spyglass Entertainment", "Revelations Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["134 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "DTS", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

Evil, as in the Source, is very clever and wears many disguises. This is what's great about this show. Evil is never fully defeated, although the lackeys are destroyed quickly, the greater evil persists.  This presents a constant challenge to the Power of Three and they must always be on their guard. Other WB shows allow the hero or heroine to win very easily and the hero or heroine is too sarcastic. Charmed, however, has the right mix of all elements and the writers appreciate that evil forces that are truly dangerous and formidable create a more rich, tense atmosphere.  The fourth season was very good, and I liked Rose as Paige very much.  The chemistry between the sisters also carries the show and their personalities seem real and three-dimensional, while other shows of this genre fail in that regard.  This is one of the best written shows on television. It really deserves more critical recognition and respect, but if that doesn't happen, I'll still enjoy it."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Charmed: Charmed: The Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4152736281", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVkYTBmOWMtZjcxMC00MGNkLTgyYmUtNzU1OGNiNjllODc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODVkYTBmOWMtZjcxMC00MGNkLTgyYmUtNzU1OGNiNjllODc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Blu-Ray Release", "uploadDate": "2018-10-26T17:06:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001061/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Holly Marie Combs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0158552/characters/nm0001061?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Piper Halliwell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "179 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0470182/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brian Krause"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0158552/characters/nm0470182?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Leo Wyatt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "145 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339797/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dorian Gregory"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0158552/characters/nm0339797?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Darryl Morris"}, {"url": "#", "name": "70 episodes, 1998-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0573037/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Julian McMahon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0158552/characters/nm0573037?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cole Turner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2000-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000192/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alyssa Milano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0158552/characters/nm0000192?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Phoebe Halliwell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "178 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000535/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rose McGowan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0158552/characters/nm0000535?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Paige Matthews"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 2001-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001147/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Shannen Doherty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0158552/characters/nm0001147?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Prue Halliwell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "67 episodes, 1998-2005"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["7 October 1998 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Charmed"], "Filming Locations": ["1329 Carroll Avenue, Central Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Spelling Television", "Northshore Productions", "Paramount Pictures"], "Runtime": ["42 min", "(178 episodes)"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

Who can forget such horrors as the Cosby Show or Diff'rent Strokes? Married was different. It dared to push the envelope of what was considered (at the time) right and proper. The family wasn't nice to each other all the time (or even any of the time!) and the show had a more real feel to it as a result.\n\nOf course, reality quickly became subjective in Married, as the episodes became ever more ridiculous and crazy. But every show pandered to some aspect of family life that we can all identify with - car sharing, hatred of our spouses relatives, puberty, dating, work etc. etc. The list is endless. If it's a real life issue, Married has spoofed it in some way or other. Nothing was sacred. Even PMS! Though the writers were reigned in a few times, by all accounts.\n\nThe show ran for eleven seasons and over 250 episodes, which is pretty incredible for a comedy show and really should give you an indication of the dedicated fan base that Married attracted. I suspect the show will be in re-runs somewhere until the end of TV as an entertainment medium.\n\nFor more info on the show I recommend the E True Story documentary on the show, which really gives an insight into how the show started, progressed and finally was cancelled."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Married With Children: Season 10", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi319077657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3NDZhMWQtYTllYi00YmFkLWIyZGEtYzhiZGE0YjEyMTIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3NDZhMWQtYTllYi00YmFkLWIyZGEtYzhiZGE0YjEyMTIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Married With Children: Season 10", "uploadDate": "2019-04-12T04:53:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642145/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ed O'Neill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092400/characters/nm0642145?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Al Bundy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "261 episodes, 1987-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000294/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amanda Bearse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092400/characters/nm0000294?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marcy D'Arcy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "261 episodes, 1987-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004910/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Faustino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092400/characters/nm0004910?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bud Bundy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "261 episodes, 1987-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569337/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ted McGinley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092400/characters/nm0569337?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jefferson D'Arcy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "169 episodes, 1989-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005408/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Katey Sagal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092400/characters/nm0005408?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Peggy Bundy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "261 episodes, 1987-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000775/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Christina Applegate"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092400/characters/nm0000775?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kelly Bundy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "261 episodes, 1987-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1792610/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Buck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092400/characters/nm1792610?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Buck the Dog"}, {"url": "#", "name": "106 episodes, 1987-1995"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308399/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Garrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092400/characters/nm0308399?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Steve Rhoades"}, {"url": "#", "name": "81 episodes, 1987-1995"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Release Date": ["5 April 1987 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Not the Cosbys"], "Filming Locations": ["ABC Television Center - 4151 Prospect Avenue, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Embassy Television", "ELP Communications", "Columbia Pictures Television"], "Runtime": ["22 min", "(262 episodes)"]}}

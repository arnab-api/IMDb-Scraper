Better editing like stuff on YouTube that really digs into the heart and soul of the character. A traditional clip show with the character or actor setting up clips by telling a story. Or Michael Pe\u00f1a's Luis from Antman doing his voice over recaps. Could have mixed comic, animated shows and MCU history to really dive into the lore of the characters.\n\nCould've been something new and fresh but it's just a marketing tool for the real stuff. I'll still watch them as the new shows come out, and I hope they do better longer ones for characters who's stories are more complete instead of just to hype new content.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Marvel Studios: Legends", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3389964569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWI1M2I5NjMtOTIxZS00MDI1LWI2NWEtMjlhZDE2ODZhYTU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWI1M2I5NjMtOTIxZS00MDI1LWI2NWEtMjlhZDE2ODZhYTU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Marvel Studios: Legends", "uploadDate": "2021-01-12T13:02:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": "Error loading cast information -- checked 2021-05-07 22:33:02.581170", "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["8 January 2021 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Marvel Studios: Legends"], "Production Co": ["Marvel Studios"], "Runtime": ["7 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

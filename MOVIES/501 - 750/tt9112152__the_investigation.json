Soren Malling was also in 'A War', as Asbaek's character's defense lawyer, but in The Investigation he's the main character, Jens Moller. Moller's character type will be familiar to fans of police procedurals - he's the hardworking detective with troubles at home. What distinguishes The Investigation from lesser series in the genre, however, is its eschewal of graphic violence and unlikely or fantastic plot developments. The latter can perhaps be explained by the series being a representation of a true story so strange and unique that no over-writing is necessary. The quality of the writing is exemplified when Moller lets down his daughter to attend a calll-out to the pathology lab. While waiting on a bench outside the lab with his junior female partner, she falls asleep on his shoulder, and in that simple moment we see that he is providing the support to her that his daughter needs from him. We are also shown his professional values in the contrasting way he deals with reporters seeking news on the case, and Kim Wall's parents. He promises them all that they'll be the first to know if he has any news, but he only delivers on that promise to the parents. We sense that he has his priorities right. The Investigation's biggest strength is in showing the immense effort that goes in to achieving justice when a murder is committed. Without that effort, justice can't be achieved, and so it is a reminder that justice doesn't come cheaply. But surely that's the way it should be if we're to value human life appropriately.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1023787289", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZiZTg5N2ItZTBjMS00MmY0LWEwMDgtNzE0ZmI4ZDZkMGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZiZTg5N2ItZTBjMS00MmY0LWEwMDgtNzE0ZmI4ZDZkMGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Bring truth to the surface.", "uploadDate": "2021-01-05T16:48:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0540038/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "S\u00f8ren Malling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm0540038?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jens M\u00f8ller Jensen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000278/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Pernilla August"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm0000278?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ingrid Wall"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0159836/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Laura Christensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm0159836?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Maibritt Porse"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0166060/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hans Henrik Clemensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm0166060?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nikolaj Storm"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3420188/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Anders Juul"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm3420188?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Christian Skov"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5519694/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Josephine Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm5519694?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cecilie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5567446/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Brian Hjulmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm5567446?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Efterforsker 1"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4908429/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Christiane Gjellerup Koch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm4908429?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Efterforsker 2"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1561982/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pilou Asb\u00e6k"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm1561982?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jakob Buch-Jepsen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0489858/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm0489858?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joachim Wall"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3874296/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dulfi Al-Jabouri"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm3874296?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Musa Amin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0083260/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Henrik Birch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm0083260?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lars M\u00f8ller"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0612675/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Charlotte Munck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm0612675?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kirstine"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1502351/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Henning Valin Jakobsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm1502351?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Klaus Rasmussen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6952712/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lucas Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9112152/characters/nm6952712?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Anders"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2020"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Denmark", "Sweden", "Norway"], "Language": ["Danish"], "Release Date": ["1 February 2021 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Efterforskningen"], "Production Co": ["Copenhagen Film Fund", "Fremantle", "Miso Film"], "Runtime": ["262 min", "(entire series)"]}}

This is a fantastic show with great characters and amazing plot lins which just get better with every season.\n\nThis show is about Ezra Bridger, a young force sensitive boy who joins a rebel cell with cool new characters like Kanan, Sabine, Zeb and Chopper and we see the early beginning of the rebellion between episode 3 and 4. And I love some of the new characters, especially Zeb, Chopper and Ezra and they have such chemistry together and it is lovely to see how they evolve and how they interact with each other.\n\nI must admit, that I dont like the animation style as much as the Clone Wars style, but it is ok and you get used to it. I get when people call it more kid friendly but still, there are cool plotlines and a good laugh arent something bad in my opinion and I think it gets more adult friendly as the show continues. Ok, there are some filler episodes that arent really relevant and of course there are some stupid episodes, but almost every show has moments that you dont enjoy, but the majority of the episodes are really fun to watch and the bring something new to the World of Star Wars and they expand the Canon. That are the only negative things I could think about and I dont believe that they are really bad or are hurting the show.\n\nWhat else I really like is, that we get a new look on older Characters like Darth Vader, Maul, Ahsoka Tano, Captain Rex, Princess Leia, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Bo-Katan, Hondo Ohnaka and others and they do their part in delivering some cool plotlines.\n\nOn top of that we also get some more new Characters integrated into the Canon, like Great Admiral Thrawn, Agent Callus, The Bendu or the Inquisitors. And all of them bring something new to the world and it is nice to see how the characters evolve over the seasons.\n\nThe only reason why Rebels only gets a 9/10 instead a 10/10 is simply that it isnt integrated as much into the overarching Star Wars Story as for example The Clone Wars and Rebels stands on its own for the most part and even the ending didnt really get a final conclusion and is still left open. But of course that can change in the near future with the second season of the Mandalorian where Bo-Katam and Ahsoka should make their Live-Action debut and maybe we even see other characters returning. And maybe even there will even be some connections to the upcoming Obi-Wan show or the Cassian Andor show. And if that happens and Rebels will have a bigger impact on the entire Franchise, then I am sure I will lift this up to a 10/10.\n\nStill I would recommend it to every Star Wars fan, because it is an amazing addition to the Canon and you should build your own opinion about the show", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Series Finale", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1396160537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDNlOWQ4OGYtMzA1My00YzlkLWJkMDItNWUyYjllOGUwYzAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDNlOWQ4OGYtMzA1My00YzlkLWJkMDItNWUyYjllOGUwYzAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the Series Finale Trailer for \"Star Wars: Rebels.\"", "uploadDate": "2018-02-27T19:11:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2342402/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Taylor Gray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2930604/characters/nm2342402?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ezra Bridger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "73 episodes, 2014-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0551223/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vanessa Marshall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2930604/characters/nm0551223?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hera Syndulla"}, {"url": "#", "name": "68 episodes, 2014-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0089710/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Steve Blum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2930604/characters/nm0089710?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Zeb Orrelios"}, {"url": "#", "name": "67 episodes, 2014-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0048389/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dee Bradley Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2930604/characters/nm0048389?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rex"}, {"url": "#", "name": "37 episodes, 2014-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1396048/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dave Filoni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2930604/characters/nm1396048?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "C1-10P a.k.a.

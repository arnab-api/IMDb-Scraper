The way it was described was misleading, the trailer made some very questionable choices so walking into the theatre I went in completely impartial, I wasn't expecting good I wasn't expecting bad. The film is extremely mediocre and safe, you don't learn anything or come away with a different point of view, which is what the film intended. The frame rate was extremely high and while that sounds like a good thing it was genuinely nauseating. It felt like a rollercoaster with how everything moved and happened. While the cinematography was great the story wasn't. The Villans make unreasonable choices that drive the plot. While at the end there's a decent character arc for the main villain, the hero doesn't. Most characters don't really change and the morale and character traits feel very forced. The film seems somewhat political and while that's not necessarily a bad thing or a film killer it wants to change the opinion of boarder control activists. It boarder line shoves the message down your throat. If your a film buff you may have noticed the plot isn't original, it's leon: the professional. The plot is very similar except for the \"on the run\" aspect of the film, while I don't think it's bad for it to take a little inspiration it doesn't feel original at all. Genuinely it's not as good as I've heard people call it, it's an overbudgeted, safe, unoriginal movie. The characters lack personality and plot feels unnecessary. Good background noise.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3107897625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNkODE5OTUtZTRlNy00MzQ1LWE4MzktYTA4Njc4NDg3NWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNkODE5OTUtZTRlNy00MzQ1LWE4MzktYTA4Njc4NDg3NWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A rancher on the Arizona border becomes the unlikely defender of a young Mexican boy desperately fleeing the cartel assassins who've pursued him into the U.S.", "uploadDate": "2020-12-04T01:20:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10840908/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jacob Perez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6902332/characters/nm10840908?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Miguel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1840708/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Teresa Ruiz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6902332/characters/nm1840708?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rosa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1266915/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sean A.

He had a real feel of, what I perceive to be, the Old West to be really like. He did not go in for all of the frivolousness of later episodes. He did not rely on loud talking and grandiose brashness by the actors.\n\nPeople in the earlier episodes gave the impression that they were ordinary, hard working people who barely eked a living out of a hard land. They did what they had to do to get by, out on the lonely Kansas plains. When they met disaster, it was \"implied\" on screen and the viewer could use his imagination as to what happened. Those shows did not have all of the \"Hollywood\" glitz that pervaded later episodes."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Gunsmoke", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi508213273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg4ZmU4MDEtMGY5Ny00OWQ2LWFkMTUtZmVkZDI5ZWM4NGIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzg4ZmU4MDEtMGY5Ny00OWQ2LWFkMTUtZmVkZDI5ZWM4NGIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-05-08T00:35:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000790/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Arness"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0047736/characters/nm0000790?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt Dillon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "635 episodes, 1955-1975"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0086469/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amanda Blake"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0047736/characters/nm0086469?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kitty"}, {"url": "#", "name": "569 episodes, 1955-1974"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915840/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dennis Weaver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0047736/characters/nm0915840?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chester"}, {"url": "#", "name": "290 episodes, 1955-1964"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0832065/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Milburn Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0047736/characters/nm0832065?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Doc"}, {"url": "#", "name": "605 episodes, 1955-1975"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0193411/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ken Curtis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0047736/characters/nm0193411?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Festus"}, {"url": "#", "name": "306 episodes, 1959-1975"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0833363/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Glenn Strange"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0047736/characters/nm0833363?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sam"}, {"url": "#", "name": "206 episodes, 1961-1973"}]}], "details": {"Release Date": ["10 September 1955 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Marshal Dillon"], "Filming Locations": ["Stage 1, CBS Studio Center, 4024 Radford Avenue, Studio City, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Arness Production Company", "CBS Television Network", "Filmaster Productions"], "Runtime": ["30 min", "60 min"]}}

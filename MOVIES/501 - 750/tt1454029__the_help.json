There are so few roles written for black women and I was thrilled to see such great roles filled by Viola Davis (Abigail) and Octavia Spencer (Minnie) - both should be nominated for supporting roles although in my opinion, along with Emma Stone, all three share top billing.\n\nThe character development in this movie is really outstanding \u2013 I hate movies with flat single dimension characters and these from the lowest to those with the most screen time are just remarkably developed \u2013 even the newspaper editor, the lines they chose for him to keep gave you enough information that even he is a memorable character with only three scenes, maybe 4 in the entire movie. Same for Stuart, Skeeter's love interest \u2013 you actually like him then hate him and he only has maybe 3 minutes of air time. Great great job. Sissy Spacek with so few speaking moments is great as is Cicely Tyson who speaks volumes even in scenes with no words. Admittedly, being based on an amazing book the background story was already set out and tracks the book closely without some of the details but they have done a great job of putting it to film \u2013 \n\nThis movie sets out beautifully a terrible time in our history that unfortunately is not over \u2013 it is better, but not over by a long shot. Being a child of the south and coming up during that time, being raised by such bigoted grandparents and parents, it leaves me pause to wonder how I avoided this rabid virus of hate and takes me back to long hot lazy days in the deep south before every building was air conditioned \u2013 such attention detail right down to the Jesus fans they waved in church \u2013 awesome flick. You FEEL the heat, the tension, the pain, the injustice of the time but still you laugh with them even as you cry for them - both races - ignorance is to be wept over.\n\nHowever, I think this movie does more, goes further in its exploration of the behavior of the privileged during that time. They were rabid toward blacks but were not that much better toward anyone who did not share their socio-economic status (the way the \"Junior League\" treated Celia) and the enormous peer pressure they put on one another (the club encouraging Skeeter's mother to make a poor decision). It visits the sins of the parents passed on to their children \u2013 the bigotry and injustice that is learned at the knee of our elders. OMG it is just an awesome, poignant, moving, NOT TO BE MISSED film.\n\nMesmerizing from start to finish \u2013 never once drags \u2013 just an easy easy easy 10"}, "duration": "PT2H26M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi809278745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgxNjQwMDY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEwMzAwNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgxNjQwMDY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEwMzAwNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Jackson, Mississippi, 1962: aspiring writer Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan (Stone) returns home after college, where unexpected friendships with African-American maids Aibeleen Clark (Davis) and Minny Jackson (Spencer) result in a book that gives a previously unheard voice to a community's suffering.", "uploadDate": "2011-04-20T13:45:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1297015/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emma Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm1297015?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Skeeter Phelan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397171/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bryce Dallas Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm0397171?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hilly Holbrook"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1567113/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jessica Chastain"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm1567113?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Celia Foote"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005049/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Allison Janney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm0005049?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Charlotte Phelan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4554932/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eleanor Henry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm4554932?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mae Mobley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1645313/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chris Lowell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm1645313?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Stuart Whitworth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1036181/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mike Vogel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm1036181?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Johnny Foote"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0450116/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Brian Kerwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm0450116?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Phelan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0205626/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Viola Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm0205626?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aibileen Clark"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818055/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Octavia Spencer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm0818055?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Minny Jackson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1501738/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ahna O'Reilly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm1501738?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Elizabeth Leefolt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2319871/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Anna Camp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm2319871?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jolene French"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4554786/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Emma Henry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm4554786?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mae Mobley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001807/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cicely Tyson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm0001807?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Constantine Jefferson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000651/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sissy Spacek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1454029/characters/nm0000651?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Missus Walters"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["10 August 2011 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Help"], "Filming Locations": ["Clarksdale, Mississippi, USA"], "Budget": ["$25,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$26,044,590,", "14 August 2011"], "Gross USA": ["$169,708,112"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$216,639,112"], "Production Co": ["DreamWorks", "Dreamworks Pictures", "Reliance Film & Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["146 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "SDDS", "Datasat"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

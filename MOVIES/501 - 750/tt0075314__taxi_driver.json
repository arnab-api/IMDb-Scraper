Travis's loneliness is a hyper representation of the same loneliness most humans have experienced at different times in different measures. It is always associated with a nightmare and Martin Scorsese delivers it like a nightmare. Travis, possessed by Robert De Niro at the zenith of his powers, cruises in his taxi enveloped in Bernard Herrman and we, well, we're the passengers and everything looks terrifying and familiar at the same time. Paul Schrader sensational screenplay comes to life with the jolting force of a rude awakening. Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his \"You looking at me\" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it. Jodie Foster awoke the insane devotion of a real life would be killer and New York, the greatest city in the world was shown with its underbelly up. A work of art, a superlative reminder of what film could actually give us and very rarely does.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi474987289", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJhZTNmOTQtN2E5Yy00OTc3LTg2ZjctNGQxNjRkMTZmZTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJhZTNmOTQtN2E5Yy00OTc3LTg2ZjctNGQxNjRkMTZmZTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-09-20T21:52:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007958/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Diahnne Abbott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0007958?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Concession Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0034519/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Victor Argo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0034519?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Melio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0043039/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Garth Avery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0043039?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Iris' Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000983/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Albert Brooks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0000983?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0192276/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Copper Cunningham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0192276?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hooker in Cab"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0225734/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brenda Dickson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0225734?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Soap Opera Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000149/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jodie Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0000149?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Iris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364997/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Leonard Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0364997?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Charles Palantine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0012524/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Frank Adu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0012524?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Angry Black Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0034082/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gino Ardito"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0034082?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Policeman at Rally"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001967/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter Boyle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0001967?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Wizard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0169903/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Harry Cohn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0169903?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cabbie in Bellmore"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000134/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Robert De Niro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0000134?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Travis Bickle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0279206/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Harry Fischler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0279206?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dispatcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0335580/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nat Grant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075314/characters/nm0335580?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Stick-Up Man"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["9 February 1976 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Taxi Driver"], "Filming Locations": ["Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA"], "Budget": ["$1,300,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$116,458,", "19 February 1996"], "Gross USA": ["$28,262,574"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$28,441,292"], "Production Co": ["Columbia Pictures", "Columbia Pictures", "Bill/Phillips"], "Runtime": ["114 min", "110 min", "(cut)"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby SR", "(re-release)", "Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

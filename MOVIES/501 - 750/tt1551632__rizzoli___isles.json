This one set in Boston \"Rizzoli and Isles\" involves the cases of crime and murder in Boston and you have daylight and dark working together on the cases. First enter the tough and by the book seasoned detective Jane Rizzoli(played wonderful by the sexy and exotic beauty Angie Harmon)as Jane always questions the clues and evidence found at the scene, and to make matters more interesting is the educated and witty crime scene medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles(Sasha Alexander)who looks inside the dead bodies for more answers. And both differ on opinions and ways of solving cases still the work ethic and chemistry blends well to form a good crime fighting solving team. Typically the cases they crack are gruesome and cold blooded murders the kind of cases you've seen on TV involving lust killers and serial murders. Usually always in the end the hard work leads to twist and turns with the bad guy being caught.\n\nGood supporting turns are given from Bruce McGill as a supervising detective Vince Korsak and veteran Lorraine Bracco as Jane's overprotected and loving mom Angela. Overall this is a good crime drama series that entertains and it makes you think as most of the gruesome cases take twist then they are solved. And plus it's a nice treat to see the beautiful Angie Harmon at work again especially in a lead role. So check out \"Rizzoli and Isles\" if you haven't.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Rizzoli & Isles", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi32357657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjYxMzdiNDYtZWQyZi00Yzk5LThlMTMtNTQxODIxZTA5ZTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjYxMzdiNDYtZWQyZi00Yzk5LThlMTMtNTQxODIxZTA5ZTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Rizzoli & Isles", "uploadDate": "2019-04-04T22:34:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004990/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Angie Harmon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1551632/characters/nm0004990?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jane Rizzoli"}, {"url": "#", "name": "105 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0108758/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jordan Bridges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1551632/characters/nm0108758?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Frankie Rizzoli Jr."}, {"url": "#", "name": "105 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000966/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lorraine Bracco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1551632/characters/nm0000966?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Angela Rizzoli"}, {"url": "#", "name": "105 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0018734/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sasha Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1551632/characters/nm0018734?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maura Isles"}, {"url": "#", "name": "105 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569226/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bruce McGill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1551632/characters/nm0569226?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vince Korsak"}, {"url": "#", "name": "105 episodes, 2010-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0949810/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lee Thompson Young"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1551632/characters/nm0949810?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Barry Frost"}, {"url": "#", "name": "56 episodes, 2010-2014"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish", "Italian", "Latvian", "Russian", "French", "Scottish Gaelic"], "Release Date": ["12 July 2010 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Rizzoli and Isles"], "Filming Locations": ["Port of Los Angeles High School, San Pedro, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Hurdler Productions", "Ostar Productions", "Warner Horizon Television"], "Runtime": ["60 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

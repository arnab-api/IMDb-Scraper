The generic full of unnecessary gore and a lack of believability storyline was definitely missing from this well written and performed series. Nothing in this genre usually surprises me, but this was something very different.  Looking at the reviews I thought I'd give the first episode at least a quick view to see if this was anything other than predictable. From the off, I was captivated at the beguiling and compelling storyline, something different with twists and turns, which totally sucked me in.  As further episodes unfolded, the acting is so believable from all the cast, although did sit up and take particular notice of Kate Siegel, who plays one of the Crain siblings, that you cannot do anything but sit captivated and neck deep in this Netflix masterpiece. I jumped at times that I thought were safe, questioned parts that I thought I already had a handle on and sat shocked at the route of the already captivating story line. I have only given this an 9 as there is always room for perfection, but the investment I made in the characters of this nothing short of an original piece, was definitely a 10. Great dialogue, acting and unpredictable storyline.., this one has it all going on.

Certainly Vera is moody and temperamental (aren't we all flawed in some ways?),but she gets the job done and gets her team to produce results. While she has her own demons, she's tenderhearted when she needs to be and ultimately kind to her staff if they do their jobs and deserve her kindness. The way she gets people to tell her things is calculated, but the method works on the show and in real life. I find the acting in \"Vera\" to always be superb, and the plots are clever, fresh and full of surprises. Also, David Leon (Joe) is gorgeous--and this from a 75-year-old woman. I'll miss him in upcoming episodes, but I'm sure the shows will still be top quality. Vera is one of the reasons this U.S. Midwesterner has become a fan of British TV. Aside from public television, sports and a couple of series, I hardly watch any U.S. TV anymore.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Vera: Set 5", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi450474777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU5ZWNkNzEtNjZlOC00ZWM5LTgyOWQtMzVlMTQ5NWIwNGMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU5ZWNkNzEtNjZlOC00ZWM5LTgyOWQtMzVlMTQ5NWIwNGMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Vera: Set 5", "uploadDate": "2015-08-16T05:21:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000950/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brenda Blethyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1693592/characters/nm0000950?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "DCI Vera Stanhope"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2011-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4474370/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Riley Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1693592/characters/nm4474370?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "DC Mark Edwards"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2011-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0607201/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jon Morrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1693592/characters/nm0607201?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "DC Kenny Lockhart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "41 episodes, 2011-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0234910/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kenny Doughty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1693592/characters/nm0234910?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "DS Aiden Healy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2015-2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["2011 (UK)"], "Also Known As": ["Vera"], "Filming Locations": ["Wallsend, Tyne & Wear, England, UK"], "Production Co": ["ITV Studios"], "Runtime": ["90 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

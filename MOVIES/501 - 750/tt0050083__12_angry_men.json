My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.\n\nThe acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.\n\nThe writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.\n\nThis is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "12 Angry Men", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3452609817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3MWNhZDYtYjFlMS00MzM4LTg5M2YtYTAwMGY2ZDg0OGY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3MWNhZDYtYjFlMS00MzM4LTg5M2YtYTAwMGY2ZDg0OGY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Three Reasons Criterion trailer", "uploadDate": "2012-08-23T03:04:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000842/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Martin Balsam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050083/characters/nm0000842?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Juror 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002011/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lee J.

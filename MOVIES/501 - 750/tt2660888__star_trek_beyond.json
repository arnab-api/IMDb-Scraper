I was skeptic when I heart J.J. Abrams was not directing it and the writing was done by Simon Pegg and Doug Jong. Fortunately, it turned out to be a solid trek film.\n\nStar Trek Beyond begins with the Enterprise and it's crew on a five year research mission in uncharted space which was assigned to them at the end of the previous movie. Kirk is struggling staying focused as captain of a starship and he is doubting himself if this is the life he wants to live. The Enterprise takes a break from exploring in a massive star base called Yorktown. The star base receives a distress call from an alien woman who lost it's crew on a distant planet. Of course the Enterprise is the best ship to help the alien woman and search for the crew. But this search and rescue mission turns very ugly when they encounter one of the most ruthless villains who's hatred of the Federation puts the whole enterprise crew to the test. \n\nI think they did a marvelous job again and made a Star Trek movie just as great as the previous two installments. The villain was not as interesting as Kahn but the movie makes up for it by focusing on the characters. The story lays more focus on new development like the bond that grows between Bones and Spock and the new female alien character Jaylah (Sofia Boutella, who did a marvelous job) which Scotty encounters. The third act of the movie is the best (with an excellent soundtrack, Beastie Boys and Star Trek mixes very well!) and they once again pull out all the stops with visual and sound effects.\n\nThe only caveat I have with this film is the slow start and the main plot being a bit simplistic. Sometimes it feels just like a regular Star Trek episode, but then again that is also one of it's strengths. \n\nSo definitely check this one out if you liked the previous two Star Trek films, it's a solid and very entertaining journey.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi354465561", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test.", "uploadDate": "2016-07-19T01:11:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1517976/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Pine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2660888/characters/nm1517976?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain James T.

If you liked that one you will like this. It is very much just more of the same. If it ain't broke, you know.\n\nA couple new faces, one of them I really liked seeing. Won't say who it was, but if you're older than 20, chances are good you like the person.\n\nThe action is like last time, it's entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.\n\nThey once again have fun with the fact that the characters \"in game\" represent characters in the movies \"real life\". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think he's taking some serious acting classes, he's getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.\n\nI didn't feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better. So yeah, I was entertained, but it's pretty shallow and won't stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1173208857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU2OTM5NDQtOTcwZi00MWQzLTg4YjUtOTJiOGUxYzIwMjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWU2OTM5NDQtOTcwZi00MWQzLTg4YjUtOTJiOGUxYzIwMjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "A team of friends return to Jumanji to rescue one of their own but discover that nothing is as they expect.

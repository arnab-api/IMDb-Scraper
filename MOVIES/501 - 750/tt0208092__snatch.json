There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens onscreen without it having an effect on the plot.\n\nBy now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once.\n\nThere are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points (Think The Ring vs. Ringu, did we need the \"How long could you survive down there all alone?\" line?). Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully.\n\nThe cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying \"Zee Germans\" and things like \"It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it?\" quite a bit. Naturally, Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen.\n\nSummary: watch the movie, and don't expect to be TOLD everything, expect to have to pay attention."}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Snatch", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1558577433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGU4YzdkNmQtMjJjMS00MDA4LTkwYWUtYjNiNDNhMDMzZDcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Screen Gems", "uploadDate": "2008-05-30T02:10:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001125/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Benicio Del Toro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0001125?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Franky Four Fingers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005068/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vinnie Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0005068?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bullet-Tooth Tony"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0784884/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rade Serbedzija"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0784884?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Boris the Blade"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0285495/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alan Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0285495?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brick Top"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0311563/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Robbie Gee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0311563?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Vinny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001971/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ewen Bremner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0001971?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mullet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011744/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0011744?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tyrone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0065874/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Andy Beckwith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0065874?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Errol"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001199/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dennis Farina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0001199?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cousin Avi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000093/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brad Pitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0000093?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mickey O'Neil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005458/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jason Statham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0005458?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Turkish"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0717372/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mike Reid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0717372?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Doug the Head"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416694/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lennie James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0416694?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sol"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002076/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jason Flemyng"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0002076?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Darren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0065307/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "William Beck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0208092/characters/nm0065307?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Neil"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK", "USA"], "Language": ["English", "Russian"], "Release Date": ["19 January 2001 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Diamonds"], "Filming Locations": ["UK"], "Budget": ["GBP6,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$27,932,", "10 December 2000"], "Gross USA": ["$30,328,156"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$83,557,872"], "Production Co": ["Columbia Pictures", "SKA Films"], "Runtime": ["104 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "SDDS", "Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

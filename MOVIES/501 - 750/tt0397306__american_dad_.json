The sad truth (i really mean sad) is that the jokes, and plot lines in American Dad are much more interesting, humorous, and intelligent than any new Family Guy episode. I loved Family Guy. I say loved because it seems to be the one that has fallen prey to recycled humor and an obvious detachment from its original creator. I don't know if lackluster Stanford grads were picked to write new Family Guy, or its just been watered down for mass consumption, but its return is so stale that MacFarlane needed another outlet source for his genius. It is American Dad. It has the same energy that pre-cancelled Family Guy episodes have. Along with that, it also has the same number of people disliking it for its dry sick humor, and overall intelligence. The fact that the show has generic characters is a joke itself for those who may not have noticed. Its recycled Family Guy lines aren't out of lack of creativity. They too are inside jokes for those who know all the Family Guy lines. If you are a true fan of what made Family Guy great, then American Dad should fill the void of what it now lacks. Another show ahead of its time for MacFarlane, which I hope gets cancelled and becomes rare since its current issues are far too developed for most people with Neilson Ratings boxes in their homes."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "American Dad!: Volume Five", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2612763417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzYmQzOTAtNzI2Zi00NjBlLTk5ZDgtYzdiMTU3ZjQ5NGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzYmQzOTAtNzI2Zi00NjBlLTk5ZDgtYzdiMTU3ZjQ5NGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for American Dad!: Volume Five", "uploadDate": "2010-12-21T06:05:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532235/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Seth MacFarlane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397306/characters/nm0532235?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Stan Smith"}, {"url": "#", "name": "303 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342241/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Scott Grimes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397306/characters/nm0342241?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Steve Smith"}, {"url": "#", "name": "303 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0048389/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dee Bradley Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397306/characters/nm0048389?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Klaus"}, {"url": "#", "name": "303 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0769446/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wendy Schaal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397306/characters/nm0769446?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Francine Smith"}, {"url": "#", "name": "303 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1484134/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rachael MacFarlane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397306/characters/nm1484134?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hayley Smith"}, {"url": "#", "name": "303 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["6 February 2005 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["American Dad!"], "Production Co": ["20th Century Fox Television", "Atlantic Creative", "20th Television"], "Runtime": ["22 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby", "(as Dolby Surround)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

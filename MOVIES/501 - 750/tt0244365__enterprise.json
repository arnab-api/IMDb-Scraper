But I don't really want to rehash everything that everybody else has said, want I want to do is express my disappointment in a majority of the fans.\n\n Back Off!!!  A lot of the comments on this site have been nothing more than whining and nit-picking about what Enterprise \"isn't.\"  The concept of this show has apparently flown past your heads at warp 4.5!  This isn't Trek as we know it!  That is the point, the traditional Trek was a tired dog that was on it's last leg.  The idea here is to do something new, something different that we weren't ready for.  Stop analyzing what it should be, what it could be, and what it has already done wrong.\n\n For those of you who haven't yet seen it, I'm telling you that it is fantastic; it's thrilling, touching, funny, adventurous, and as interesting and curious as the original series.  But, when you watch it, go in with ABSOLUTELY no preconceived notions of what Trek is or what it should be. Berman and Braga have done exactly what they have set out to do and that is to reinvent Trek.\n\n And for those of you who apparently had to bite your lip through this, where the heck is YOUR sense of adventure.  We are seeing the BEGINNING of Star Trek! This is a dream come true!  I mean come on guys,  we got to witness the FIRST time they ever see a Klingon!! How cool is that.  If you would stop trying, endlessly to find something to complain about, you would find yourself enjoying little things like finding out where Kirk's famous speech \"Space, the final frontier...\" actually came from, or seeing how afraid they are of the transporters.  How you can not be slightly giddy seeing  Jonathan Archer pick up a \"Phase Pistol\" and ask, \"What's this?\" These are the nuggets that you are letting slip by because you have this notion that you know what is best for Star Trek.  I have loved all the series'( though Voyager is by far my least favorite) but it was time for something new.\n\n One last beef with the fans, lay off the theme song.  I think its wonderful.  This is another one of those preconceived notions we have of what Trek is supposed to be.  Yes, it is different than what we are used to, but if you stop judging and actually watch the images being shown and actually LISTEN to the words, you may find it slightly inspiring. Not to mention the fact that it is actually a very pretty song, that is, when you haven't already canned it because of being close minded.\n\nThis series is not about the continuation of Star Trek, it is about the beginning of mankind's exploration into deep space; this is why it isn't called Star Trek: Enterprise, but instead it is just Enterprise.  This is not the utopian society of past Trek shows.  These people are flawed, curious, impulsive, and very far from perfect.  They make many mistakes and that is their enduring charm.  They want this so bad and are just learning how to swim.  There are so many other things I loved, such as the grappler and the amazement of a pathetic warp 5, not to mention the fantastic cast and characters (Scott Bakula has always been a personal favorite of mine!,)but I just don't have room to go into detail.\n\n So on that note, stop shooting them down before they get going; I have a feeling its going to be one Hell of a ride!  Let's Go!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 1 Blu-Ray Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2275393049", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmViNzkzNjUtNDNhNS00Mzc0LWJhM2EtZmQ5MGI3NjE1MjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-03-30T13:17:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000836/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Scott Bakula"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0244365/characters/nm0000836?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Capt.

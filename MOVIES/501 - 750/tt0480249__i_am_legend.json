And was deeply, deeply moved.\n\nI've got to start with the scenes of a deserted New York City post-apocalypse. These were so very, very moving; and very, very convincing. The clips in the trailers for the movie were good, but you really have to see the full panoply of close-up shots, distance shots, etc to really appreciate the sheer scale of what this movie is depicting. There's something of On the Beach and Resident Evil and of any number of disaster movies and zombie movies here. But none of them do justice to the New York depicted here. This is a New York City we see large-scale and micro-scale in order to show us the environment in which the main character is acting.\n\nAnd Will Smith is simply brilliant as the sole survivor, Robert Neville. Will delivers movingly and convincingly on a script that really focuses on giving us a picture of \"what it would be like\" ... to be the last man on earth, living off the land in NYC. This is the real strength of this movie: there's really not a lot of blood or gore or zombie scenes at all. Yet I was riveted as Robert goes through his \"typical days\" in NYC. Every moment was full of pathos and full of menace, too. And occasionally we got some relief from Smith's trademark humor that blended seamlessly with the rest of his performance to give us \"what it would be like\" with a powerful delivery that just leaves me almost breathless.\n\nThere's an effective use of flashbacks that partly tell us the story of how we got to where we're at in this grim New York City; and the flashbacks also serve to give us an overwhelming contrast between Life Before and Life After the apocalyptic disaster wiped out the city. Yet use of flashback was sparing, which I found all the more effective.\n\nCinematography was excellent throughout, the storyline and script are brilliant, the use of a dog, Samantha, as a key actor was perfect to show us both Robert as companion and Robert as lonely, isolated survivor.\n\nI won't give away the ending, but think it was satisfying as far as it goes, but not nearly as appealing, from my angle, as the foregoing material. That brings up my one complaint: the title. By the end of the movie, we have some sense of the meaning of the title. Yet it still seems to me to feel cheesy and really unworthy of the movie.\n\nBut that's a minor plaint. If you haven't seen this movie, and would enjoy seeing a really powerful story about a survivor in post-apocalypse New York City, hey, go check out this flick. It's really worth it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "I Am Legend", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3820028185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MTI2MTM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI5MzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MTI2MTM5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI5MzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "I Am Legend trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-11-21T13:25:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000226/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Will Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm0000226?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Neville"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2253071/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charlie Tahan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm2253071?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ethan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2405238/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Willow Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm2405238?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Marley Neville"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0333318/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "April Grace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm0333318?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "TV Personality"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2724906/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joanna Numata"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm2724906?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alpha Female"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2869725/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kona"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm2869725?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0565503/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "James McCauley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm0565503?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Male Evacuee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2857229/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Pedro Mojica"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm2857229?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sergeant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103797/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alice Braga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm0103797?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Anna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0724757/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Salli Richardson-Whitfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm0724757?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Zoe Neville"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0287756/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Darrell Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm0287756?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mike - Military Escort"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005231/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dash Mihok"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm0005231?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alpha Male"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8421984/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Abbey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm8421984?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2677021/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Samuel Glen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm2677021?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Military Driver - Jay"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1677477/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Marin Ireland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0480249/characters/nm1677477?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Woman Evacuee"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["14 December 2007 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["I Am Legend: The IMAX Experience"], "Filming Locations": ["11 Washington Square North, Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA"], "Budget": ["$150,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$77,211,321,", "16 December 2007"], "Gross USA": ["$256,393,010"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$585,410,052"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Village Roadshow Pictures", "Weed Road Pictures"], "Runtime": ["101 min", "104 min", "(Alternate ending)"], "Sound Mix": ["SDDS", "Dolby Digital", "DTS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

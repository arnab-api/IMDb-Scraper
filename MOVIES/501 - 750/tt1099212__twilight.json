The Movie is like getting to see some of her home movies now, but you don't get every detail, and a few of the \"memories\" of how Bella told you the story were a little mixed up and you feel like there is so much more and why couldn't she just have videotaped her whole life for a reality show . . . it's just not fair! Well, at least that's how I felt after seeing the movie :) \n\nBut, having read the book, you can at least feel like you know \"the rest of the story\" and can fill in the missing details of the movie in you mind. I can see where it's \"important\" to see it more than once. The first time, I just kept thinking, \"oh, they missed something\" or \"that's not how it happened\", and it just seemed like chopped pieces of the story here and there. Now, I think I can go and just relax, being excited to review the parts of Bella's home movies that she does have and enjoy those parts of her story visually. The Movie did seem \"Low Budget\", and the make-up didn't seem consistent in some of the scenes, but then, as \"Home Movies\" go, the lighting is never the same and I can just rationalize it that way. Hope this helps you to relax and enjoy the movie, and re-read the book and see the movie again... and, I just can't wait until New Moon is released, or Midnight Sun is finished . . . and hopefully one day, the continuation of the story (please Stephanie)."}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Twilight: TV Spot #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi861339673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE1NjE3NzAzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU1MjIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE1NjE3NzAzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU1MjIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Twilight: TV Spot #1", "uploadDate": "2008-11-05T10:13:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829576/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kristen Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm0829576?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bella Swan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1140952/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matt Bushell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm1140952?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Phil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0083655/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gil Birmingham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm0083655?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Billy Black"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2960208/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gregory Tyree Boyce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm2960208?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0919616/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michael Welch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm0919616?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mike Newton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1589312/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Christian Serratos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm1589312?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Angela"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1553725/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kellan Lutz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm1553725?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Emmet Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1717152/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jackson Rathbone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm1717152?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jasper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1020124/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sarah Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm1020124?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ren\u00e9e"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121605/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Billy Burke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm0121605?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Charlie Swan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1210124/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Taylor Lautner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm1210124?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jacob Black"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2014390/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Justin Chon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm2014390?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eric"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447695/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Anna Kendrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm0447695?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jessica"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1223023/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nikki Reed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm1223023?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rosalie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2230865/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ashley Greene"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1099212/characters/nm2230865?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alice Cullen"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["21 November 2008 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Twilight"], "Filming Locations": ["184 South 6th Street, St. Helens, Oregon, USA"], "Budget": ["$37,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$69,637,740,", "23 November 2008"], "Gross USA": ["$193,962,473"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$408,430,415"], "Production Co": ["Summit Entertainment", "Temple Hill Entertainment", "Maverick Films"], "Runtime": ["122 min"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital", "SDDS", "Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

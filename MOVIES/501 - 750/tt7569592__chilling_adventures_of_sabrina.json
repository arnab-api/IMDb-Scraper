I didn't know that Netflix were bringing the series back to life though, and happened to come across it by sheer random luck. Seeing that it was a delve into the series that I once enjoyed, of course I had to sit down and watch \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\".\n\nRight, well I will say that this 2018 re-visit sure was a notch up in most areas. I liked how they opted for a more mature approach to the series and the characters, and also the dark, gloomy and gothic look that the series had to it.\n\nThe characters, well, some were great, others were bland. But the acting was good and people did do good jobs with their given roles.\n\nOne thing that doesn't sit well with me in this new 2018 series is the familiar Salem. Sure, he was atrocious to look at back in the old \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" series, but he was talking and he had so much humor with him. In the new series, he is an ordinary cat milling about, unable to speak (or at least haven't done so yet) and is obviously not a funny sidekick at all.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the dark and Satanic twist they put into it this time, definitely turning it up from a corny teenage series to a more adult series.\n\nI managed to sit through season one in just one day, but am somewhat uncertain of whether or not to carry on watching it once season two is available. It was good, sure, but just lacked the charming appeal that the old series had.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Part 4 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3795697945", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E3YTE5MDctMjQ4Yy00MDhiLWIxYmMtNDJlZWU2Y2UyMzFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E3YTE5MDctMjQ4Yy00MDhiLWIxYmMtNDJlZWU2Y2UyMzFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "Sabrina's new normal quickly dissolves as menacing spirits set their sights on Greendale.

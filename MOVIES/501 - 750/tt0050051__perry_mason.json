A.s).\n\nCaveat Emptor: The episodes available for broadcast syndication are often (especially the earlier seasons, when network shows ran several minutes longer than now) edited, and the Hallmark Channel showings (when P. M. was running there) were even more edited. Anyone who'd like to know what's been cut should visit www.storrer.com and go to the esg/perrymason page therein. Dr. Storrer obviously has too much time on his hands, as he has written detailed synopses of every single episode, and kindly made them available to all through the miracle (being sarcastic here) of the information superhighway.\n\nOne last note: Many others who've commented here refer to the fine B&W cinematography, but it seems as if every night exterior was shot day for night, which I always find highly amusing, especially when they almost always throw crickets on the soundtrack, just in case we can't figure out it's supposed to be night."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Perry Mason", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi131054873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM2ZWE5M2UtNGM5ZC00ODdmLTk2ODMtMWJmOWU2NzA5N2ZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTM2ZWE5M2UtNGM5ZC00ODdmLTk2ODMtMWJmOWU2NzA5N2ZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Perry Mason", "uploadDate": "2019-04-06T22:27:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000994/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Raymond Burr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050051/characters/nm0000994?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Perry Mason"}, {"url": "#", "name": "271 episodes, 1957-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0394438/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "William Hopper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050051/characters/nm0394438?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paul Drake"}, {"url": "#", "name": "271 episodes, 1957-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848251/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "William Talman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050051/characters/nm0848251?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hamilton Burger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "225 episodes, 1957-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0354853/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Barbara Hale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050051/characters/nm0354853?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Della Street"}, {"url": "#", "name": "271 episodes, 1957-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0172615/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ray Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050051/characters/nm0172615?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Police Lt.

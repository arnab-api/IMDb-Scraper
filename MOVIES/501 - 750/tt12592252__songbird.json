The premise that the Covid-19 pandemic gets only worse a few years from now makes a solid foundation for a movie. Depiction of permanent lockdown, extreme measures, and fear are realistic and bold. Even exterior shots and special effects are decent and realistic. Realistic... Remember that word, because after half an hour all believable concepts will be lost, and the movie will turn into a Millennial fairytale.\n\nSo, before you can say \"TikTok,\" the unarmed (but carelessly handsome) youngster will win the fight(s) against the armored SWAT team (no sweat), he will pass the heavily-guarded checkpoints with just his cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die statements that he has a yellow bracelet, and generally battle (and beat) against every odd the cruel word that we all know and love put in front of him. The armed militia that kills anybody just for the wrong pronunciation of the answer to their question \"who are you?\", corrupt black marketers, his boss - everybody - are so keen to believe every word of the protagonist to degree that they will help him in his endeavor in any possible way. The very end of the movie is far more bearable with the fast-forward (or better - skip) option in your video player. But that doesn't mean the movie is boring. No sir. You'll just bite your nails as a member of one of two groups - the one cheering for the \"Johnny Handsome\", or the one cheering for the guys that want to blow his brain out.\n\nThe one thing that helped me to get through the movie is Demi Moore. She's aged, but unlike the majority of her Hollywood comrades(es), she did not try to cover her age with a knife and plastic. And she looks gorgeous. I (almost) don't regret watching the movie because of her and her acting (it's superb).\n\nEnough said. If you're a fan of the \"Millennial fairytale\" genre, look no further, you'll have a smashing time with the flick. If you are into something more realistic and original, check out Piaget's Last Fear (the book), for instance, or (pretty good and new) \"The Little Things\" with D. Washington and J.

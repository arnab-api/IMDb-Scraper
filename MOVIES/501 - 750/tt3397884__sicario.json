I truly marvel at how this film is so tightly put together and even despite it faults, which it has, especially in script, it just never gives you a chance to breathe and take it all in, thanks to the atmosphere that is established from shot one until the last one, you are always anticipating something's going to happen and that is the sign you are watching a great thriller. You are always on the edge of your seat and in some occasions you are really biting your knuckles. The movie has a way to throw you into the action that is really rare to find, especially in a highway sequence where I literally felt I was there.\n\nAll of this is achieved thanks to probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Deakins does it again, once more playing with a lot of blacks and shadows and once more succeeding one hundred percent. Also remarkable is the use of helicopter shots which don't feel like connective tissue, but actually part of the organic, that's something really hard to pull off. The sound design of this film is flat out amazing, some of the best I have truly ever had the pleasure to experience. It is so in you face, so tight, it really contributes in making you feel a part of this even in the more intimate scenes. Music too is also excellent and while some may say it was a little too ominous and dark I felt it matched the tone perfectly and enhanced some parts magnificently, contributing to a nail-biting building of tension.\n\nOf course one couldn't get past reviewing this film without nominating the three great performances at its center. Del Toro, Brolin and Blunt are each better than the other and continue stealing the screen to themselves scene after scene. There really isn't one stand out, the three of them just excel sky high and give depth to characters that are interesting. The characters are really what holds the film together, they are truly developed three dimensionally and explored in depths that aren't normally reached.\n\nWhat makes the film stumble is the fact that in never has a good enough plot to make things as interesting as they should be. It really has a hard time in setting up which way it's going and in the end it actually doesn't end up with a satisfying resolution. You are certainly left with something to think about because of the themes, the characters, the atmosphere and the intensity, but all in all the plot doesn't offer interesting turns and not enough moral questioning, unlike \"Prisoners\", and so remains slightly one-note for the whole duration. It also has a totally useless character in Blunt's partner, which other than never understanding why he was there or what was his arch in the film, I never understood how he was being played.\n\nStill there is nothing short of amazing in what Villenueve achieves in two hours. What could have been a screenplay turned into a very generic police drama, is actually one of the most atmospheric and tense movies of the year.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Now Playing", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi252490521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MTYzODAzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg0ODc4NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MTYzODAzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg0ODc4NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Sicario is now playing in theaters.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-24T14:29:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1289434/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emily Blunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm1289434?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kate Macer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000982/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josh Brolin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0000982?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matt Graver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1256532/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jon Bernthal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm1256532?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ted"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0232998/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jeffrey Donovan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0232998?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Steve Forsing"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0147814/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Julio Cesar Cedillo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0147814?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Fausto Alarcon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3229268/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bernardo Saracino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm3229268?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Manuel Diaz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0927794/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kevin Wiggins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0927794?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Burnett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2484906/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kim Larrichio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm2484906?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Silvio's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001125/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Benicio Del Toro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0001125?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alejandro"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001255/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Victor Garber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0001255?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dave Jennings"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2257207/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Daniel Kaluuya"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm2257207?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Reggie Wayne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0874232/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Raoul Max Trujillo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0874232?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rafael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0737276/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hank Rogerson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0737276?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Phil Coopers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0380073/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm0380073?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Silvio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1598758/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Edgar Arreola"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3397884/characters/nm1598758?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Guillermo"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "Mexico", "Hong Kong"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["2 October 2015 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Sicario"], "Filming Locations": ["Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA"], "Budget": ["$30,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$401,288,", "20 September 2015"], "Gross USA": ["$46,889,293"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$84,872,444"], "Production Co": ["Lionsgate", "Black Label Media", "Thunder Road Pictures"], "Runtime": ["121 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Dolby Atmos", "Auro 11.1", "DTS", "(DTS: X)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!\n\nThe whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. \n\nThe cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.\n\nWe all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H10M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 -- Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi128621593", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwODM5NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcwODM5NTcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The end begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione go back to Hogwarts to find and destroy Voldemort's final horcruxes, but when Voldemort finds out about their mission, the biggest battle begins and life as they know it will never be the same again.", "uploadDate": "2011-06-17T14:54:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000146/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ralph Fiennes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0000146?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lord Voldemort"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000614/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alan Rickman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0000614?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Professor Severus Snape"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342488/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rupert Grint"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0342488?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ron Weasley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2121541/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Evanna Lynch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm2121541?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Luna Lovegood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0993242/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0993242?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Fleur Delacour"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000457/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0000457?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ollivander"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1113863/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Graham Duff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm1113863?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Death Eater"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324597/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rusty Goffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0324597?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Aged Gringotts' Goblin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002091/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Gambon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0002091?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Professor Albus Dumbledore"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0705356/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Daniel Radcliffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0705356?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Harry Potter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0914612/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Emma Watson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0914612?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hermione Granger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1727304/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Domhnall Gleeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm1727304?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bill Weasley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001116/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Warwick Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0001116?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Griphook"}, {"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0001116?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Professor Filius Flitwick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000307/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Helena Bonham Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm0000307?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bellatrix Lestrange"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4114427/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Anthony Allgood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1201607/characters/nm4114427?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Gringotts' Guard"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["15 July 2011 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 3D"], "Filming Locations": ["Swinley Forest, Bracknell, Berkshire, England, UK"], "Budget": ["$125,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$169,189,427,", "17 July 2011"], "Gross USA": ["$381,409,310"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$1,342,321,665"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Heyday Films", "Moving Picture Company (MPC)"], "Runtime": ["130 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Datasat", "Dolby Surround 7.1", "SDDS", "Sonics-DDP", "DTS", "(DTS: X)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

It turns out they used the opportunity to make one of their best movies yet.\n\nAnt-Man was not at all what I expected. I have been a fan of most of the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic universe, but you don't have to be a fan of super hero movies to enjoy this movie. it has good pacing and holds your interest throughout. There are plenty of action and the fight scenes, but unlike the previous Marvel movies, this movie focuses on a heist. This, along with the comedy throughout, makes it a breath of fresh air in the Marvel universe. No Marvel movie since has so seamlessly bonded the genre of action and comedy. \n\nThe main character, Scott Lange, is not a billionaire or scientist or ancient god, and he doesn't have super strength or intelligence; he is a thief who deals with holding down a job and being able to see his daughter. This makes him incredibly relatable. Being played by Paul Rudd doesn't hurt either. Rudd, along with the rest of the cast, delivers a memorable performance. The idea of a father trying to reconcile his relationship with his daughter may have been used before, but Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas make it work without seeming trite or overused. The role that really stands out is Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket. He is, in my opinion, the most terrifying villain the Marvel universe has seen yet. He doesn't want global domination, he wants money and power, and that makes him a very believable villain. Stoll's performance is more three-dimensional than one might expect in a super hero movie, and adds to the already great cast.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive part of Ant-Man was the visual effects. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D, and the quality was stunning. I don't like most movies in 3D, but this one worked well. The shrinking and growing looked very good as well as the action sequences. Although the action happens on a small scale, it can stand up to any of the other movies Marvel has made. \n\nIf you haven't seen this film yet, I would highly recommend it. The acting, directing, and cinematography all make this film highly enjoyable, even if you haven't seen any of Marvel's previous films.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3829444633", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcxODU1NjcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0MDcxNjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcxODU1NjcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0MDcxNjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, con-man Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.", "uploadDate": "2015-07-05T06:08:35Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0748620/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Rudd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0748620?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Scott Lang"}, {"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0748620?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ant-Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1431940/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Evangeline Lilly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm1431940?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hope Van Dyne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0134072/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bobby Cannavale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0134072?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paxton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339460/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Judy Greer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0339460?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maggie Lang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0671567/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michael Pe\u00f1a"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0671567?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Luis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1939267/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "T.I."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm1939267?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2017943/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hayley Atwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm2017943?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Peggy Carter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0233027/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Martin Donovan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0233027?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mitchell Carson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000140/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Douglas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0000140?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Hank Pym"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1015684/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Corey Stoll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm1015684?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Darren Cross"}, {"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm1015684?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Yellowjacket"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1107001/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anthony Mackie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm1107001?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sam Wilson"}, {"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm1107001?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Falcon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5338858/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Abby Ryder Fortson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm5338858?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cassie Lang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2810287/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "David Dastmalchian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm2810287?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kurt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0365445/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Wood Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0365445?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0805476/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John Slattery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478970/characters/nm0805476?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Howard Stark"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["17 July 2015 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Ant-Man"], "Filming Locations": ["Pinewood Atlanta Studios -

And to my surprise, this was way more fun than I thought it would be.\n\nJust when you think it's another generic, teen angst, alcohol-drinking, sex-thirsting movie, the kills start happening. Not only were they gory, but they were also quite creative. The movie just knows exactly what it is and never takes itself too seriously. Plus, watching mean bullies die in horrific ways was just so satisfying to watch. (Hopefully, I'm not the only one...)\n\nMore importantly, Vince Vaughn is the reason you should watch this. You have this 6-foot-5 giant of a man running around as a teenage girl. From the way he speaks to his subtle mannerisms, it was just plain funny. He's the man-- or the woman, I mean.\n\nAs for the negatives, it mostly has to do with the writing. Basically, everything with the family was boring and predictable. It was probably the most generic part of the movie. They lazily tell you everything you need to know as soon as they're introduced.\n\nI also hate it when movies portray a character as \"ugly\" or \"undesirable\" and the actress is anything but. In other words, they want you to believe that Kathryn Newton's Millie is some kind of weirdo loser, but I just never bought it.\n\nThere's also a disconnect between Newton's Millie, who is shy, timid and quiet, and Vince Vaughn's Millie, who is girly-girl, talkative and fun. They just felt like different people. There's also, sort of, two endings. There was the natural conclusion, and everything was good, but then it goes on for another 10 minutes, and it was just unnecessary.\n\nDespite some annoying tropes and poor writing, this was a fun, self-aware movie with some horrific kills and really funny body swap moments.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10 Overall: Good\n\nRecommended for: Fans of Vince Vaughn, fans of Freaky Friday with a slasher twist, or fans of watching scumbag bullies get what's coming to them.\n\nThanks for reading!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Extended Look Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2381037849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5YzgzYzMtMThkZS00MzNmLWJjY2EtNGM3YTIxYWY3Y2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5YzgzYzMtMThkZS00MzNmLWJjY2EtNGM3YTIxYWY3Y2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "Seventeen-year-old Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton, Blockers, HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies) is just trying to survive the bloodthirsty halls of Blissfield High and the cruelty of the popular crowd.

What I like especially about the movie is the fact that it doesn't try to explain the technical causes of the Financial Crisis but the psychological causes - human failures, which are the real cause for the Crisis: greed, egotism, ignorance. Many scenes in this movie deal with very little dialogue, instead the body language and the unique atmosphere speaks for itself. The ensemble is just brilliant, especially Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons.\n\nThe movie works solely from inside the nameless firm \u2013 apart from minor steps outside. It only portraits the people working inside this company - the \"normal world\" is completely left out. The effect is a very clever one: The life of these bankers seems totally severed from the outside world, they have no real connection with normal people and seem to \u2013 speaking exaggeratingly \u2013 lack an understanding of real human values, that there could be more behind life than just maximizing and making money. They are completely left behind in their own world, which somehow got out of control. Even when the imminent truth reveals and the consequences are becoming more clearer, it always feels like they are cut off; there is a scene in a taxi with Quinto and Badgley that underlines this.\n\nBut one can also witness the cold-blooded atmosphere in the system itself, where every person could easily be mistaken as a number. A key figure of the film, Eric Dale, who gets sacked in the beginning, is confronted with two managers in a scene like from \"Up In The Air\". Either are these women robots or have never experienced something like social warmth. One widely held position is that eventually bankers themselves didn't understand their own system and products with Derivatives and Futures, etc. anymore. Almost hilarious, but sadly true is the fact that many people in these companies seem to have no understanding of Economics and just got into their position due to influence or money. When they are sitting in their conference room and discuss the incident, it feels somewhat grotesque.\n\nAlthough this movie works almost completely without music, the tension is so immense - thanks to the brilliant actors - that one is forced to focus."}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1070504985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMTQ0MDE1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyMjYxNg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMTQ0MDE1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyMjYxNg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A thriller that revolves around the key people at a investment bank over a 24-hour period during the early stages of the financial crisis.", "uploadDate": "2011-08-02T10:40:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000228/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Spacey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0000228?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sam Rogers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000460/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jeremy Irons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0000460?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Tuld"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0046112/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Penn Badgley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0046112?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Seth Bregman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001521/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary McDonnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0001521?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Rogers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001804/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stanley Tucci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0001804?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eric Dale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930053/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ashley Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0930053?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Heather Burke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1978694/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Maria Dizzia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm1978694?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Executive Assistant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002326/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Al Sapienza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0002326?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Louis Carmelo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0079273/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Paul Bettany"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0079273?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Will Emerson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0704270/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Zachary Quinto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0704270?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Peter Sullivan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0048932/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Simon Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0048932?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jared Cohen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000193/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Demi Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0000193?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sarah Robertson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0541902/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Aasif Mandvi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0541902?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ramesh Shah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0085959/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Susan Blackwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0085959?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lauren Bratberg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0658861/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jimmy Palumbo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1615147/characters/nm0658861?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Security Guard"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["29 September 2011 (Germany)"], "Also Known As": ["Margin Call"], "Filming Locations": ["Vornado Realty Trust, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA"], "Budget": ["$3,500,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$561,906,", "23 October 2011"], "Gross USA": ["$5,354,039"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$19,504,039"], "Production Co": ["Before The Door Pictures", "Benaroya Pictures", "Washington Square Films"], "Runtime": ["107 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

You have superstud David Hasselhoff(whom I liked as Michael on \"Knight Rider\"),and others plastic silicons which killed the series which spun off two installments(\"Baywatch Nights\" and \"Baywatch Hawaii\") under the production standards of Mr. Hasselhoff himself(whom serves as executive producer of the both spin offs as well as this series).\n\n2. ONLY on Baywatch could oceans filled with inept swimmers be watched over by lifeguards who ran in slow motion(and swam out to save them on the same formational shot).\n\n3. Not only it was an action packed show,but this sea-foam saga of a part soap opera of one-dimensional personalities with multidimensional bodies was,for a while,the world's most popular show(not in my book it ain't)which says more about the world than most of us care to know.\n\n4. The show made Hasselhoff an international status(which he rocketed \"Baywatch\" to the number #1 most watched show in several countries due to huge ratings overseas---but did you know its biggest audience was in Germany and Sweden?)and made stars of Yasmine Bleeth, Gena Lee Nolin,Erika Elenak,Alexandria Paul,Anna Smith(yes,Anna Nicole Smith)and the Queen of Junk TV,Pamela Anderson-Lee who acted as a human floation device during some of the episodes.\n\nFor one,producers are trying their best to bring this back too...WHY? The most recent was bringing it to the big screen as well and also a made for TV-Movie.

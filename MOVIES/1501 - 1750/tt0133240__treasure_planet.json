A space age version of \"Treasure Island\" ; instead of ships, there are spaceships, and instead of an island, there is a planet . This version also includes androids, laser-weapons and colossal space beasts. Gorgeous and astounding animated film with an outstanding and fantastic starring , Jim Hawkins, and a cyborg cook called Long Silver . Entertaining and solid retelling from Walt Disney in cartoon style with the unforgettable Jack Hawkins and the pirate Long John Silver . Ron Clemens and John Musker adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson pirate adventure with an eyeball-rolling John Silver and a sympathetic Hawkins . Again we live the roaring adventure , this time set in sidereal space . We share the struggles, the heartaches, the laughter of courageous souls who leave their houses they love to dare the wrath of the angry space pirates . Upright men and greedy pirates in conflict with their destiny enacting the Robert Stevenson's most thrilling story in search of the legendary loot of Captain Nathaniel Flint . Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's voice) encounters the artifact that leads to a distant planet where is a buried treasure. Then , the young boy join forces with Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson's voice), Doctor Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) , Ben (Martin Short) , Morph (Dane A. Davis) and of course a boisterous , rogue Long John Silver (voice by Brian Murray) journey to planet of hidden bounty . The young cabin boy Hawkins has a treasure map and a boatload of kill-crazed pirates eager for the riches hidden on Treasure Planet . Jim Hawkins matches with mechanical-legged , a notably snarly Long Silver and adventures go on . But even greater risks lie ahead when Hawkins finds out that his trusted colleague Long John is actually a nasty pirate with mutiny on his mind. \n\nFun story of outland space plenty of adventure , intrigue , fights and action . The whole piece of adventure teems with emotion , thrills , humor , astral atmosphere and being pretty amusing .The first Disney film in which the maquettes were not made entirely by hand, out of clay. Silver's cyborg parts were constructed out of plastic, using laser technology . Appropriately adventurous rendition of Robert Stevenson's often-filmed and spine-tingling tale . In the picture there are humor , rip-roaring adventures , swashbuckling and it's pretty amusing . It's a combo of computer generator and hand-drawn animation by Ron Clemens and John Musker with voices from Brian Murray , Joseph Gordon Levitt , Roscoe Lee Brown , among others . The movie mingles spectacular cartoon with FX computer generator as when the heroes are taking on monsters , battle a supernova, a black hole , and a ferocious space storm . At the film appears usual personages from Stevenson's Treasure island such as Billy Bones , Sara Hawkins , Nathaliel Flint and Mr Arrow . This film was pitched to Disney by John Musker and Ron Clements several times: In 1985, during production on \u00a8the Black Cauldron\u00a8 , but they ended up assigned to direct \u00a8Basil\u00a8. After directing \u00a8The little Mermaid\u00a8 , but they ended up assigned to direct \u00a8Aladdin\u00a8. After directing Aladdin, but the studio wanted them to direct H\u00e9rcules. Musker and Clements agreed to direct that film only if they were allowed to make Treasure Planet right after it. Rating : Above average . Well worth watching , you'll be on the edge of your seat . \n\nOther renditions -being multitudinous remakes , as there are many films made of it- based on this classic novel are the followings : Vintage version by Victor Fleming with Jackie Cooper , Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone ; Disney take on (1950) by Byron Haskin with Robert Newton , Basil Sydney and Bobby Driscoll , respectable full-blooded second-best the classic Fleming version ; European retelling (1974) by John Hough with Orson Welles , Angel Del Pozo , Lionel Stander and Kim Burfield ; Teasure Island (1999) by Marc Charlesbois with Jack Palance , Patrick Bergin and Kevin Zegers ; TV recounting by Fraser C Heston with Charlton Heston , Christian Bale and Richard Johnson .

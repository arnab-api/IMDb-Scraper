The officer then tells the manager to take the girl into her office, strip search her and then hold her there until the police can come get her. COMPLIANCE is a film that has made many people angry and the reports of walk-outs were rather shocking to see because you have to wonder why people would buy a ticket for a film like this and then get upset. I had the misfortune of living in Mount Washington, KY for a few years and this is where the original incident took place. It was at a McDonald's that I've eaten at and I even knew of the people involved in the case. Considering the \"type\" of town this place was it never really shocked me that something like this could happen but apparently it has happened all over the country. Yes, the subject matter is ugly and yes it's incredible that anyone could be so stupid to allow this to happen but it's all based on fact that people can check out. This film is a pretty ugly but I say that in a good way because with a subject like this there's really no way to paint it as something good so I admire the writer-director for just going strongly at the subject. Both Dowd and Walker turn in excellent performances as does the rest of the supporting cast. Again, the subject matter is just so crazy that it has to be true or else you'd start screaming at your television over the characters doing such stupid things. I still have a lot of questions over the actual case and especially consider the character of some involved. Having followed the case there were some major things that I felt were left out but this has little to do with this film. As a film I think it's very effective and ugly just as it should be. One could debate for years about what actually happened and what one would do if they were ever in a similar circumstance."}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1337959705", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MzY4NDU1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxMjgwOA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4MzY4NDU1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxMjgwOA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When a prank caller convinces a fast food restaurant manager to interrogate an innocent young employee, no one is left unharmed.", "uploadDate": "2012-07-04T06:20:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235652/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ann Dowd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm0235652?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sandra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2439111/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dreama Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm2439111?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Becky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3464684/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Philip Ettinger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm3464684?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kevin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2507405/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nikiya Mathis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm2507405?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Connie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0668436/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stephen Payne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm0668436?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harold"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2132755/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Amelia Fowler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm2132755?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0564548/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "James McCaffrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm0564548?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Detective Neals"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3681028/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Matt Skibiak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm3681028?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Gilmour"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785854/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matt Servitto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm0785854?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Supplier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372366/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pat Healy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm0372366?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Officer Daniels"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1534700/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ashlie Atkinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm1534700?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marti"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2981816/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ralph Rodriguez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm2981816?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Julio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0131966/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bill Camp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm0131966?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Van"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4516868/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Merolla"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm4516868?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Customer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3210828/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Desmin Borges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1971352/characters/nm3210828?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Officer Morris"}]}]}

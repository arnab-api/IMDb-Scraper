Unfortunately, the locals do not think highly of young, unprotected women and she soon becomes their victim. Is this the end, or only just the beginning? \n\nSome have praised this version of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" as superior to Meir Zarchi's original film. I could not disagree more. This version is weak, far less stunning, and borders on the \"torture porn\" trend of the last decade that I thought -- incorrectly, apparently -- was dying.\n\nSome changes were made, such as updating technology and adding in a police man. But it was a very clich\u00e9 addition, and the only aspect that makes it an improvement at all is because the officer has a daughter. The rest of it is just one-dimensional fluff.\n\nThe nudity and rape scenes are toned down dramatically. Some have said the original pushed it too far, but that was the point: violence is not real when it is entertainment. It should horrify, shock and sicken you. This film shortens and weakened the rape sequences, making it more of a gimmick than a real shocker.\n\nFrom there, the film becomes \"torture porn\" -- how can we burn, chop, mutilate the men as badly as possible? It far exceeds the first film. And unlike the original's use of sex to lure the men to their doom (a clever turnaround), here it is just raw violence.\n\nI suppose the sound and picture quality are improved due to a decent budget and modern technology, but it is just a disposable film. I will go on pretending the remake never happened, because it is the ultimate disappointment. One more weak plot with weak characters, a remake that does not honor the original in any way or try to improve upon it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1713632/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sarah Butler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm1713632?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jennifer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397110/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Andrew Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm0397110?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Storch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0247672/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rodney Eastman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm0247672?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Andy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910145/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tracey Walter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm0910145?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Earl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3061574/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Saxon Sharbino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm3061574?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chastity"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0105226/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeff Branson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm0105226?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Johnny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0291881/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Daniel Franzese"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm0291881?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Stanley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0511349/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chad Lindberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm0511349?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Matthew"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0589700/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mollie Milligan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm0589700?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mrs. Storch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2361634/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Amber Dawn Landrum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242432/characters/nm2361634?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Girl at Gas Station"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["20 January 2011 (Argentina)"], "Also Known As": ["Day of the Woman"], "Filming Locations": ["Texas Ave & Levy St, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA"], "Budget": ["$2,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$32,440,", "10 October 2010"], "Gross USA": ["$93,051"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$1,278,650"], "Production Co": ["Cinetel Films", "Anchor Bay Films"], "Runtime": ["108 min", "(unrated)", "105 min", "(R-rated)"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

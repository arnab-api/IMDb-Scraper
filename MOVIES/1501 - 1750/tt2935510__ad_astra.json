All the themes are very rich, and even though it's a space epic set in a world where traveling to the moon is not a very unusual thing to do, it all feels very real and personal.\n\nThis is a cinematic masterpiece in directing, sound and cinematography. It resembles 2001: A Space Odyssey in a few ways, mainly the lighting, and the colours of some scenes, a few angles too.\n\nIt always follows the main character's perspective, so the voiceover kind of makes sense, it's always the things that he thinks, or the stuff that's in his mind.\n\nThe music compliments the events of the story very well, the sounds were pretty realistic and jaw-dropping, and almost every frame is just beautiful.\n\nThe acting is mostly good. There weren't a lot of people in the film, but Brad Pitt and Tommy-Lee Jones are knocking it out of the park.\n\nI only have a few little issues with the movie.\n\nThere was a scene with a CGI monkey, (you all know what I am talking about), which just came out of nowhere. It was really odd, and out of place. Also, the CG on it was the weakest in all of the movie.\n\nMy second issue was with the scene on the moon, with other vehicles. It was foreshadowed, but it really didn't need to be there, and while it was made very well and effectively, the events themselves are too unrealistic because of how convenient some things are.\n\nAlso, there are sequences where milimeters could matter, lives could be at stake if someone makes a mistake, and sometimes they are lucky enough to conveiniently survive.\n\nBut overall, this is something I'd like to see again. It shows how much ambition Sci-fi has, but it also shows what could go wrong with it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Ad Astra", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3836788505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-08-23T01:20:01Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000093/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brad Pitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm0000093?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roy McBride"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1550948/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ruth Negga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm1550948?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Helen Lantos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0253708/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kimberly Elise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm0253708?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lorraine Deavers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1334507/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Donnie Keshawarz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm1334507?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Captain Lawrence Tanner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0632629/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bobby Nish"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm0632629?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Franklin Yoshida"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0278125/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John Finn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm0278125?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brigadier General Stroud"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0791467/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Freda Foh Shen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm0791467?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Captain Lu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0438500/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ravi Kapoor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm0438500?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arjun Dhariwal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000169/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tommy Lee Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2935510/characters/nm0000169?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "H.

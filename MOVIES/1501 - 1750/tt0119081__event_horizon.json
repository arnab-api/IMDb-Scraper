It was so long ago in fact that I simply couldn't recall. I was 35 when I first saw this movie; after it had finished I felt like I was 10 years old and had just finished watching an old scratchy B&W werewolf flick.\n\nIt had been so long since I had truly been disturbed in a scared way I'd almost forgotten what it felt like. Schindlers List troubled me, but not in this way, this was a true feeling of shock and horror. Four or five minutes after the screen had gone blank and the music faded, I'm still staring at the TV screen in a nicely terrorized state. I had to shake myself to snap out of it. Fabulous!!!!!\n\nI love seeing peoples faces after I have told them to watch this film. They give me that, \"Oh my God!!!!!!\" look and breath in deeply at the same time. They too have been truly traumatized for a short while. When they discover the nature of the garbled video message is a great recoil moment within the film and one I can still remember some 5 years after seeing it. If you're easily scared don't watch this movie, you'll have a heart attack. If you haven't been scared in a while then be prepared for how marvelous that feeling is. \n\nYOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Event Horizon", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1179583001", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2JjYzFiOWUtZjk1Ny00YzIwLThiMzQtODhmNDAzMDkwYWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2JjYzFiOWUtZjk1Ny00YzIwLThiMzQtODhmNDAzMDkwYWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2009-10-17T04:01:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000401/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Laurence Fishburne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119081/characters/nm0000401?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000599/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kathleen Quinlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119081/characters/nm0000599?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peters, Med Tech"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429114/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richard T.

The draw of the film is fast paced, adrenaline pumping action, a lot of tough guys & gals who never smile, and really cool monsters and special effects for 2010.\n\nIt's rated PG-13 for some violence and gore, and there is no sexuality, nudity or profanity (except 1 awesome use of the word b*tch). The \"violence and gore\" is shot very fast, so even though it depicts people being ripped in half & such, it's not quite as disturbing as, say, a Quentin Tarantino film where you watch a guy slowly bleed to death for 15 mins. In other words, this is good stuff to watch with your teenage kids or puritanical parents, either way.\n\nThere are some big names on the cast, and all performances were solid, but nothing really stood out as remarkable. That is to be expected in a fast paced film. But I would have preferred a powerful monologue or two just to use the talent to its full potential. I will say Ralph Fiennes did a chillingly original portrayal of \"Hades\", making him to be a twisted, limping, bitter wretch who still possessed terrifying power and fury. He is definitely my favorite part of the production.\n\nNow on to the bad, which others have covered in detail so I'll just graze over. If you think you can study for your Classical Literature exam by watching this, you're going to get flunked all the way back to James Whale's 1931 \"Frankenstein\" (the most successful yet inaccurate adaptation of literature ever). Different characters in mythology seem to have been transposed, juxtaposed and just plain posed for the sake of this 2010 story. The biggest liberty is that here our hero Perseus is fighting against the gods when the original literature shows that he was tremendously helped by the gods by being given special weapons and gifts. In this film he is given those same gifts which he indignantly refuses but then later sheepishly accepts them because they'll save his life. I'm not sure if that was meant to be hypocritical, ironic, or just a sloppy oversight in the screenplay, but it's worth noting. Just what exactly is this film saying below the surface? That humans have outgrown gods? Or that we ultimately still need gods?\n\nBut for the most part, this gives us a decent taste of Greek Mythology which was truly the origin of the timeless scifi/fantasy/horror genre thousands of years ago. Chances are, most people will simply enjoy this movie for its action, fantasy and special effects. For that, yes, it delivers. But for literary accuracy... well I would be terrified to approach any literature teacher with the mere mention of this movie. That teacher would kick my Assaracus out of school and I'd be crying all the way Homer."}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Clash of the Titans: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2626946073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg0MDg4ODUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg4ODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjg0MDg4ODUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg4ODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Perseus (Worthington) who was born of a god but raised as a man, sets off on an epic mission to combat Hades (Fiennes) before he can seize power from Zeus (Neeson) and unleash hell on earth.", "uploadDate": "2009-12-18T16:46:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0941777/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sam Worthington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0941777?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Perseus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000146/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ralph Fiennes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0000146?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hades"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2605345/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gemma Arterton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm2605345?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Io"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3548867/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tine Stapelfeldt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm3548867?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Danae"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1812656/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Luke Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm1812656?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Apollo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0192377/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Liam Cunningham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0192377?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Solon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1678557/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ashraf Barhom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm1678557?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ozal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1613839/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ian Whyte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm1613839?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sheikh Suleiman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000553/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Liam Neeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0000553?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Zeus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002076/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jason Flemyng"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0002076?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Calibos"}, {"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0002076?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Acrisius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1111968/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alexa Davalos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm1111968?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Andromeda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0586568/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mads Mikkelsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0586568?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Draco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005232/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Izabella Miko"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0005232?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Athena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0558548/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hans Matheson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm0558548?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ixas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1758311/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mouloud Achour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0800320/characters/nm1758311?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kucuk"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "UK", "Australia"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["2 April 2010 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Clash of the Titans"], "Filming Locations": ["Canary Islands, Spain"], "Budget": ["$125,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$61,235,105,", "4 April 2010"], "Gross USA": ["$163,214,888"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$493,214,993"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Legendary Entertainment", "Thunder Road Pictures"], "Runtime": ["106 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "DTS", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

I got Season 1 & 2 for her birthday, watched them and pre-ordered Season 3.. Everyone in my family now is watching it-that would be Minn, Washington state, and Florida. My Dad was a B-17 pilot during WWII, both he and my mother really enjoy this story. One really bonds with the characters and the added plus of learning about wartime Britain is fascinating. I highly recommend this series-really good stories and history too. Each DVD seems to have an extra about the actual events that take place in the story. More and more I find I am looking towards the UK, for quality entertainment both in movies and TV..Hope they keep it coming!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Foyle's War: The Complete Saga", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1992929817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRiZTVkNmQtMjA1MC00MTE5LWExMzQtYmViMmZmOGExMjZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRiZTVkNmQtMjA1MC00MTE5LWExMzQtYmViMmZmOGExMjZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Foyle's War: The Complete Saga", "uploadDate": "2015-12-09T07:27:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0457655/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Kitchen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0310455/characters/nm0457655?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Christopher Foyle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2002-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397928/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anthony Howell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0310455/characters/nm0397928?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paul Milner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 2002-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0917320/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Honeysuckle Weeks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0310455/characters/nm0917320?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Samantha Stewart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2002-2015"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["2 February 2003 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Foyle's War"], "Filming Locations": ["St Mary's Church King's Walden, England, UK"], "Production Co": ["Greenlit Productions", "Paddock Productions"], "Runtime": ["90 min", "200 min", "(TV)"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

They spoil way, way too much. Many of the movie's best sequences, or at least fragments of them, are shown in the trailers. Several times I found myself thinking while watching the movie, \"I know where this is going because I saw a clip in the trailer.\"\n\nNow I'll give a quick plot overview of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.\n\nAfter witnessing the carnage, chaos and death that ensued during the theme park's meltdown in the last movie, you may be wondering why any human would ever set foot on the island again. It's a very reasonable thought.\n\nIn brief, all the dinosaurs on the island are going to become extinct after the island's volcano erupts. Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, right? Just let nature correct the mistake humans made in bringing back the most dangerous predators to ever exist. While we're thinking about the volcano, I'm also curious about why the founders of the park ever chose to build on an island with an active volcano that could wipe out all nearby life. Seems like poor planning. Also poor planning, is endangering human lives with a rescue mission to an island with an erupting volcano.\n\nAgainst all logic, operation: Save the dinos has its supporters. An animal protection group, headed by a less steely and less robotic Clair Deering (Bryce Dallas Howard), convinces a billionaire to fund a mission to rescue the dinosaurs.\n\nBut, oh no! The team needs help tracking Blue, the last surviving raptor. Cue raptor trainer extraordinaire Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). Those two are joined by a paleo-veterinarian (apparently a real thing) and an annoying tech guy who is afraid of absolutely everything, including bugs and planes. As you can imagine, he does not hold up well around dinosaurs.\n\nI'm not sure why the scaredy-pants character was ever written into this movie. He's meant to provide comic relief, but isn't that why Chris Pratt is here? Pratt is actually funny, and he's wasted in this movie, relegated to a puppet of a character, who showcases none of the charismatic cool he demonstrated in the prior film.\n\nBeyond the obvious character development flaws, there is one unavoidable issue: I don't agree with their mission. How can I root for these heroes if they're doing something indisputably foolish? I love animals, but these particular animals have killed countless humans and will surely kill more. I cannot support risking more human lives for this mission.\n\nThat's not the movie's only problem. For one, the directing is spotty. A few sequences will wow the viewers, as long as they haven't already seen these clips in the trailers. Director J.A. Bayona has a background in horror that becomes evident in this movie. He creates dingy lighting and makes clever use of shadows as dinosaurs approach their victims. When the dinosaurs fully reveal themselves, Bayona knows to focus the camera on teeth, claws and eyes--the scariest parts of the creatures.\n\nSome of the action is legitimately scary. Other times, it's cartoonish. One scene in particular feels like something you would see in Scooby-Doo.\n\nThe issue with the action, other than being occasionally cartoonish, is how often in leans on callbacks to past Jurassic movies. Sure, the concepts are fun and well-executed, but we have seen them all before.\n\nHere we are at the fifth movie in the franchise, and the filmmakers are clearly out of fresh ideas. They're banking on fans flocking to see the movie solely because it has dinosaurs. I demand something more from my movies, and you should too.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2465250073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjVlZjc2MDItOWVkMi00ZGExLWJhOTMtMTAyNGY5ZjdjMWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjVlZjc2MDItOWVkMi00ZGExLWJhOTMtMTAyNGY5ZjdjMWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-06-15T17:41:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0695435/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Pratt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0695435?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Owen Grady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1245863/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rafe Spall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm1245863?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eli Mills"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4427331/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Daniella Pineda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm4427331?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Zia Rodriguez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429363/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Toby Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0429363?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mr. Eversoll"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000156/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jeff Goldblum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0000156?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ian Malcolm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001036/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Geraldine Chaplin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0001036?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Iris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3016166/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Robert Emms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm3016166?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tech Merc"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6442861/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kevin Layne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm6442861?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sub Pilot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397171/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bryce Dallas Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0397171?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Claire Dearing"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6819854/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Justice Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm6819854?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Franklin Webb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000342/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "James Cromwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0000342?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Benjamin Lockwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0505971/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ted Levine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0505971?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ken Wheatley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000703/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "BD Wong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0000703?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dr. Wu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9830820/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Isabella Sermon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm9830820?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Maisie Lockwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0419273/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter Jason"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4881806/characters/nm0419273?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Senator Sherwood"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Russian"], "Release Date": ["22 June 2018 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"], "Filming Locations": ["London, England, UK"], "Budget": ["$170,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$148,024,610,", "24 June 2018"], "Gross USA": ["$417,719,760"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$1,310,464,680"], "Production Co": ["Universal Pictures", "Amblin Entertainment", "Legendary Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["128 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "DTS", "(DTS: X)", "Dolby Atmos", "Auro 11.1", "Dolby Surround 7.1"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

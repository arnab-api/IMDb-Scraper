Sitting at just one hour and 25 minutes, She Dies Tomorrow just didn't feel like there was enough meat on the bones; we get introduced to such an array of characters, yet spend such little time with any them to really understand who they are. As the film progresses, characters keep getting introduced but our interest in them fades more and more with every new addition. Because of this, the film begins to feel weightless.\n\nThe themes of mental health and the literal fear of death are poignant and relevant here, giving us something to relate to but because of our absence of any real main character, Seimetz almost throws the themes out there and hopes something will stick with audiences - and like most 'deep' films, its up to interpretation. This ambiguity some will like, adding to repeat viewings but not me, this comes across as unintentional and a cop-out for actually crafting an organised and cohesive film.\n\nThe acting throughout is stellar across the board, I just wish the cast had more to play with in their characters.\n\nThis feels like a common case of style over substance.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H26M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1493548569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM3ODE3NmItNTQ5Yi00ZDk2LThjOGMtN2U4NjQ4MWZiMTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM3ODE3NmItNTQ5Yi00ZDk2LThjOGMtN2U4NjQ4MWZiMTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After waking up convinced that she is going to die tomorrow, Amy's carefully mended life begins to unravel.

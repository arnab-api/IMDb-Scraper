She is focused on finding other life almost to the exclusion of all else in her life. When aliens respond to the Earth's first interstellar broadcast, she is caught up in the hysteria. \n\nWhat follows is an interesting observation of humanity rather than any aliens. We learn very little about aliens throughout the movie. Rather, we see how people react to knowledge of this magnitude. The movie examines religious, scientific, military and international reactions to the idea of humanity not being alone. I thought they did a fantastic job of representing the scale of reaction, from the fanatic to the skeptic, within the confines of a 2 hour movie. The movie mixes a thoughtful, sentimental tone with a good pace for action and excellent characterization. There is a somewhat arbitrary love story thrown in, but it is tolerable based on how it helps the protagonist's long-delayed progress towards a deeper understanding of her own humanity.\n\nThe movie ends in a poignant yet hopeful tone, understanding our human problems but accepting them. I think the message is that the alien contact is the catalyst that will help humanity mature and grow past our more dark halves.\n\nIf you like the movie I'd recommend the book. It gives much more insight on the aliens, and expands the scope as there are a number of scientists that participate rather than just one from America, and goes more in depth into the science. It also attempts to show that religion and science can get along. My favorite part is at the very end of the book where Sagan shows how God hid a message in the very fabric of the cosmos, that we could only read when we were ready. Be prepared however, the book is quite a bit drier than the movie and those who don't enjoy reading Discover magazine may have to dig in to get through the slower, more scientific parts.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Contact", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2509177369", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWY3YTgxNDctZmE2My00MmIwLTg5ZDktODEzNGQwODQ4NjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWY3YTgxNDctZmE2My00MmIwLTg5ZDktODEzNGQwODQ4NjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Blu-Ray trailer for this science fiction film starring Jodie Foster", "uploadDate": "2009-06-10T03:28:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0540441/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jena Malone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0540441?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Young Ellie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000149/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jodie Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0000149?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eleanor Arroway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001209/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "William Fichtner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0001209?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0573934/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Timothy McNeil"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0573934?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Davio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000190/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matthew McConaughey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0000190?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Palmer Joss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0835231/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Henry Strozier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0835231?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Minister"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005092/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Larry King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0005092?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Larry King"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0157952/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Conroy Chino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0157952?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "KOB-TV Reporter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001556/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Morse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0001556?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ted Arroway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0086553/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Geoffrey Blake"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0086553?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Fisher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0156341/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sami Chester"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0156341?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Vernon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0839647/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Laura Elena Surillo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0839647?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cantina Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000643/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tom Skerritt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0000643?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "David Drumlin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242882/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Max Martini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0242882?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Willie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0307775/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Thomas Garner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118884/characters/nm0307775?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ian Broderick"}]}]}

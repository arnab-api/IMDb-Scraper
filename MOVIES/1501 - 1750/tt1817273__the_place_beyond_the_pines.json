It's the equivalent of advertising the whole of Disneyland with just clips of Space Mountain again and again. There's a lot more going on here than Ryan Gosling robbing banks and being a general badass in The Place Beyond The Pines. There are in fact at least three main characters all with their own story. And while the Ryan Gosling section is, a bit like Space Mountain at Disney, the best bit of the package he is only one part of a much bigger picture. \n\nA motor bike stunt rider finds out he has a son so packs in his day job and takes the logical step of robbing banks to provide for him. The story deals with the family life of the man as well as a rookie cop who exposes his police department to be corrupt. \n\nI found the film very absorbing from the start with Ryan Gosling's character development on fast forward so at least 3 massive life events all happen in the first 20 minutes of the film. There's not a lot of action scenes but when there are they're very tense and exciting. \n\nThe family life aspect is quite heartwarming and you do believe that his character does love his son and wants to provide for him. There are fantastic believable acting performances all round here with Ryan Gosling and later on Bradley Cooper really showcasing their acting talents. It's engaging and I really cared what happened to both of their characters. \n\nThe main problem with the film is it's length and not knowing when to stop. The first part of the film is constantly engaging and would be a nine out of ten if the film stayed like that the whole way through. When the focus shifts from characters however it really doesn't feel as exciting and almost feels like the start of totally different movie. A movie that isn't bad but is nowhere near as good as the one you've just seen.\n\nEvery story told is linked obviously but sometimes it feels a tad loose. There is a dramatic time shift when the film reaches the 100 minute mark and what follows really seems to drag. It never really felt like it was going anywhere. It was by no means boring however, it just lost a bit of steam towards the end. The Place Beyond The Pines is worth a watch but just be prepared to have you're socks blown off and then have them planted firmly back on your feet as the film continues.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "UK Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi267494937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.", "uploadDate": "2013-03-28T05:18:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331516/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Gosling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm0331516?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Luke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0578949/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eva Mendes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm0578949?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Romina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4747999/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Angelo Anthony Pizza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm4747999?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Baby Jason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5584565/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Facci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm5584565?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Priest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5584275/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tula"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm5584275?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Robin's Dog"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4656396/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cynthia Pelletier-Sullivan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm4656396?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Teller #1 - Bank #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5583554/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nicole Califano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm5583554?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Teller #3 - Bank #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5583918/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tracey Agustin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm5583918?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Teller #1 - Bank #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3995471/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Craig Van Hook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm3995471?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0580646/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Olga Merediz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm0580646?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Malena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0991810/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mahershala Ali"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm0991810?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kofi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0578853/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ben Mendelsohn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm0578853?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Robin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5584193/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Penny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm5584193?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Robin's Dog"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5583968/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mackenzie Trainor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm5583968?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Teller #2 - Bank #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1699530/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Shannon Plumb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1817273/characters/nm1699530?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lady in Ice Cream Shop"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["19 April 2013 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Place Beyond the Pines"], "Filming Locations": ["Glenville, New York, USA"], "Budget": ["$15,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$279,457,", "31 March 2013"], "Gross USA": ["$21,403,519"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$47,052,899"], "Production Co": ["Sidney Kimmel Entertainment", "Electric City Entertainment", "Verisimilitude"], "Runtime": ["140 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Datasat"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

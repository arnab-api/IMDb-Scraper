It was a really fresh idea to place zombies during the Korean middle ages(Joseon era) a direct contrast to most zombie films we see today, located at the modern urban landscape. The decision to do that breaths new life to the so far tired zombie genre.\n\nMoreover, what I found incredibly interesting is the \"subtle\" commentary on the extremely hierarchical korean society, which is the actual disease that has consumed the nation. Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.\n\nBtw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead. Here zombies RUN, no time to waste and the living ones have to use whatever tools they find, mainly tools used in agriculture and farming!\n\nIn terms of visual aestetics the series looks stunning! Amazing cinematography, directing, costumes, locations, action scenes, it is truly impecable.\n\nWhat I would like to see is stronger female characters as the series is very male dominated.\n\nGood job to everyone involved and can't wait for the second season!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2133047833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZjMzg3YjctMzc2Yi00YTY0LWE3MjAtNjBiNWUyNjI0Nzk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZjMzg3YjctMzc2Yi00YTY0LWE3MjAtNjBiNWUyNjI0Nzk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The deceased king rises and a mysterious plague begins to spread.

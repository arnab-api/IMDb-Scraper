This was evident in the fact that the four other Best Picture nominees for the year were all independent productions.  \"Jerry Maguire\" shows the business world of America at its worst, in this case in the sports industry.  When Jerry Maguire, a sports agent, (played by Oscar-nominated Tom Cruise) has a breakthrough one night he realizes that quality is more important than quantity.  Of course he is fired from his job and loses all of his clients except Rod Tidwell (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in his Oscar-winning performance).  Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) has left the business with Maguire, agreeing with his views.  However, Maguire struggles with his separation from the sports corporation (losing his fiance and the first pick in the NFL Draft).  However, he survives and learns that living well and loving well are the keys to happiness.  All in all, \"Jerry Maguire\" is classic Hollywood stuff made in the present-day.  Cameron Crowe's script and direction are subtle, but extremely effective.  Tom Cruise delivered his best performance to date.  Renee Zellweger proved to be the find of the year and Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s quotes and scenes he stole were enough to win him the Oscar in a very competitive year in the Best Supporting Actor category.  \"Jerry Maguire\" is not a perfect film. In fact it is flawed in many ways and is not very accurate in some areas.  However, its ability to mix comedy, romance, and drama make it a very entertaining film.  The performances are all excellent.  4.5 out of 5 stars."}, "duration": "PT2H19M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Jerry Maguire", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2527247897", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-03-05T17:05:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000129/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Cruise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0000129?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jerry Maguire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000250/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0000250?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dorothy Boyd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005278/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jerry O'Connell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0005278?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Frank Cushman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001372/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bonnie Hunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0001372?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Laurel Boyd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005151/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jonathan Lipnicki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0005151?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ray Boyd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0671210/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mark Pellington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0671210?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bill Dooler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0433095/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jared Jussim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0433095?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dicky Fox"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0066492/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ingrid Beer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0066492?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Anne-Louise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000421/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cuba Gooding Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0000421?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rod Tidwell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000593/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kelly Preston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0000593?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Avery Bishop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001542/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jay Mohr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0001542?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bob Sugar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005093/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Regina King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0005093?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Marcee Tidwell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0521974/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Todd Louiso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0521974?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chad the Nanny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0836836/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jeremy Suarez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0836836?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tyson Tidwell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0807426/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Benjamin Kimball Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0116695/characters/nm0807426?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Keith Cushman"}]}]}

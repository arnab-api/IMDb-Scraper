Obviously they've lived in a cave and never seen an Adam Sandler movie before.\n\nYou don't watch Adam Sandler for a cerebral workout.  You'll never see him starring opposite Anthony Hopkins or Merryl Streep.  Okay, I realize his IS cast opposite Oscar-Winner Kathy Bates, but don't confuse me with details. This movie is just a bunch of jokes wrapped around a weak plot.\n\nStill, the jokes are really funny.  I don't usually laugh out loud at the movies, but I guffawed at many parts of this movie.  If nothing else, it stimulates the Three Stooges area of the frontal lobe of your brain.\n\nOn the down side, Rob Schneider must be a good friend, because his role was obviously a last-minute toss in.  Schneider is not funny in this movie and his \"lines\" are by far the campiest element of this movie.\n\nStill, it was amazing how the crowd with which I saw it reacted to the football scenes in the movie.  I looked around and everyone was anxious or cheering like they're best friend was playing in the Super Bowl.  Also, this is the hardest I've seen an audience laugh since \"There's Something About Mary\".\n\nIn short, if you can accept the fact that the plot is completely unbelievable and just watch it for laughs, you will enjoy this movie.  If you're looking for Oscar-winning drama, go elsewhere.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi194558489", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU4MzgyYjQtNGYwYy00ZjAyLWFkMGYtYzMyNTA5OTg1YzhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU4MzgyYjQtNGYwYy00ZjAyLWFkMGYtYzMyNTA5OTg1YzhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-10-15T21:37:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001191/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Adam Sandler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0001191?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bobby Boucher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001857/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Henry Winkler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0001857?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Coach Klein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0715274/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jerry Reed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0715274?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Red Beaulieu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0163703/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Blake Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0163703?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Farmer Fran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0521781/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jonathan Loughran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0521781?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lyle Robideaux"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397212/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Clint Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0397212?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001705/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rob Schneider"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0001705?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Townie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0463767/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Kokol"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0463767?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Professor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000870/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kathy Bates"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0000870?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mama Boucher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000103/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Fairuza Balk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0000103?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vicki Vallencourt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0319142/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lawrence Gilliard Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0319142?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Derek Wallace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0200601/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter Dante"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0200601?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gee Grenouille"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0925987/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Al Whiting"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0925987?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Casey Bugge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0184445/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Allen Covert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0184445?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Walter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390845/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Todd Holland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120484/characters/nm0390845?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Greg Meaney"}]}]}

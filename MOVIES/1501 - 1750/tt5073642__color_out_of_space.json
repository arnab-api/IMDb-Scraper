It premiered at TIFF last year but had a brief wide release this year. Lovecraft movies are very hit or miss. Aside from the films of Stuart Gordon, like Re-Animator and From Beyond, no one has really succeeded in making a really good one. His stuff is hard to adapt because a lot of it is short, not easy to adapt into a feature. Also, a lot of the imagery in his stories is intentionally impossible to visualize. That, and his stuff has tons of casual racism in it, even for the time it was written. Color Out of Space is one of the better Lovecraft adaptations out there. It updates the story to a modern setting and it adapts one of his least racist stories, like Stuart Gordon did with Re-Animator. However, unlike Re-Animator, I don't think this movie will be remembered as a classic. The acting isn't that great, with the exception of a good old crazy performance from Nicolas Cage. The effects are well-done, it's bloody and intense and of course it's very colourful, but overall there just isn't really much that's memorable or stand-out about it. It's a solid horror movie, but that's about it. I hear the director wants to do other Lovecraft adaptations like The Dunwich Horror and I think that's great. The movie actually kind of sets up a possible Lovecraft cinematic universe that could be worth exploring and I will gladly watch out for, but I still don't think this movie is the masterpiece that Lovecraft fans have been waiting for. While I don't think it's great and I don't think people will be watching this movie over and over again like Re-Animator, I think this is still worth checking out for horror and sci-fi fans, especially Lovecraft fans.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi735493913", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3MGQyZDEtYTFiMi00MzFiLWE4ODQtY2NiMzMzYzIyZjUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3MGQyZDEtYTFiMi00MzFiLWE4ODQtY2NiMzMzYzIyZjUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-11-06T18:16:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000115/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicolas Cage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm0000115?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nathan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4699715/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Madeleine Arthur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm4699715?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lavinia Gardner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001045/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tommy Chong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm0001045?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ezra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6623135/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Julian Hilliard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm6623135?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jack Gardner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0452963/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Q'orianka Kilcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm0452963?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mayor Tooma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7258153/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Amanda Booth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm7258153?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Secretary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11637447/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Xibanga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm11637447?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Comet the Horse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11637449/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Laia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm11637449?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sam the Dog"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000613/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joely Richardson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm0000613?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Theresa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3231931/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elliot Knight"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm3231931?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ward Phillips"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2063811/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brendan Meyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5073642/characters/nm2063811?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Benny Gardner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1892220/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Josh C.

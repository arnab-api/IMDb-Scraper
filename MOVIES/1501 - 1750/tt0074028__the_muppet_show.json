A show like this could only have come from the genial mind of the puppeteer Jim Henson. It was produced by Jim Henson and his team of 'Sesame Street'.\n\nWhat makes it so distinctive is that it is like a theater show (or even a cabaret-like theater house) with a cast of hand-operated puppets (or Muppets). This shows well the concern of making something very imaginative and creative. To make it even more complete, it is quite entertaining. Immense amusement and classic humor are priorities as well.\n\nTogether with 'Sesame Street', 'The Muppet Show' is part of childhood's fond and nostalgic memories of many (myself included). Plus, both children and grown-ups can enjoy this juvenile program. I remember I used to watch many episodes of this at primary school, together with kids from other classes in an awesome video room of that school. It was so much fun! We had many laughters in that video room.\n\nThe best and funniest characters from 'The Muppet Show' are Kermit the Frog and that crazy Miss Piggy. One word to describe both: hilarious!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Muppet Show: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4139843865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWY4ZTQ0MWItYTExZS00YjA4LWIzNjktYjc3Mjc2MTUwMDQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWY4ZTQ0MWItYTExZS00YjA4LWIzNjktYjc3Mjc2MTUwMDQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT #3 Post", "uploadDate": "2008-08-04T03:58:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000568/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frank Oz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074028/characters/nm0000568?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Fozzie Bear"}, {"url": "#", "name": "120 episodes, 1976-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324397/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dave Goelz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074028/characters/nm0324397?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gonzo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "120 episodes, 1976-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0625456/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jerry Nelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074028/characters/nm0625456?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Floyd Pepper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1976-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0926209/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Steve Whitmire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074028/characters/nm0926209?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Additional Muppets"}, {"url": "#", "name": "66 episodes, 1978-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0402611/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Richard Hunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074028/characters/nm0402611?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Statler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "120 episodes, 1976-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001345/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jim Henson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074028/characters/nm0001345?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kermit the Frog"}, {"url": "#", "name": "120 episodes, 1976-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0325028/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Louise Gold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074028/characters/nm0325028?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Additional Muppets"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 1977-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0612020/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kathryn Mullen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074028/characters/nm0612020?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Additional Muppets"}, {"url": "#", "name": "57 episodes, 1978-1981"}]}]}

I really enjoyed it, and felt that it lived up to the teary and heartwarming trailer. While the movie has an uplifting \"go for your dreams\" message, the deepest theme is that of family.\n\nWill Smith did a great job as the father trying to protect his son from their circumstances of becoming homeless as much as he can, while at the same time trying to work in the competitive world of stocks as an un-paid intern. Jaden Smith was outstanding as the preschool-aged kid who knows things are going wrong and tries to have a stiff upper lip, but just can't do it all the time.\n\nThe story is very touching and was close to home for me. My family has been through some tough times, and this movie just reminded me of how much my parents struggled to provide for our family and yet kept life fun as much as they could. I am excited to go see this with my parents as a way to say thank you.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Pursuit of Happyness", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1413719065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Pursuit of Happyness", "uploadDate": "2012-11-04T03:36:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000226/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Will Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0000226?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Gardner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0628601/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thandie Newton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0628601?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Linda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0439170/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "James Karen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0439170?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Martin Frohm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0298281/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kurt Fuller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0298281?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Walter Ribbon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0922182/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kevin West"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0922182?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "World's Greatest Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0798900/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David Michael Silverman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0798900?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Doctor at First Hospital"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0130278/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Geoff Callan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0130278?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ferrari Owner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0458136/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Scott Klace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0458136?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tim Brophy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1535523/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jaden Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm1535523?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christopher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397788/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brian Howe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0397788?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jay Twistle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0144657/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dan Castellaneta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0144657?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alan Frakesh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0279137/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Takayo Fischer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0279137?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mrs. Chu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0156475/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "George Cheung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm0156475?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chinese Maintenance Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2044962/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Domenic Bove"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm2044962?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tim Ribbon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2380684/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Joyful Raven"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454921/characters/nm2380684?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hippie Girl"}]}]}

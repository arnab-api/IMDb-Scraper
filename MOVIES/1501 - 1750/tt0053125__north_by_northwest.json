It's essentially a rehash of many of his earlier films, with a plot partially derived from The Thirty Nine Steps and the very similar Saboteur, while there are borrowings from Foreign Correspondent and Notorious, among others. However, it is all done with such style and confidence that it doesn't matter if it's essentially just a greatest hits package.\n\nVery few other films of this kind attain the near perfect tone of this one, precariously balanced between seriousness and silliness. Sometimes this film manages the very difficult trick of being both suspenseful and comical at the same time, as in the auction house scene, or the wonderful scene in the lift when the hero's mother turns to two heavies in a lift looking menacingly at the hero and says \"you gentlemen are not REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?\".\n\nOf course the famous crop dusting plane scene and the Mount Rushmore chase are terrific. The former is really more notable for the amount of time taken to build up to the action than the action itself, while the technical work on the latter still looks pretty good. In a totally different vein is the astonishingly frank seduction sequence on the train. Hitchcock takes his time here as with many of the other scenes, but the film is so crammed with memorable passages that one hardly notices it's 136 mins long.\n\nErnest Lehman's script is full of wonderful lines, many of them delivered so well by chief villain James Mason that at times we almost want to root for him. \"Has any one ever told you tend to overplay your various roles Mr Kaplan....it seems to me you fellows could stand a little less training from the FBI and a little more from the Actor's Studio\". Cary Grant is so smooth one almost forgets he's over 50, and of course there's also Bernard Herrmann's vibrant score.\n\nEndlessly enjoyable even with repeated viewings. How many of today's thrillers will be such fun in 25 years time?"}, "duration": "PT2H16M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "North by Northwest", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi473956889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmVkYmFiYzgtYzgzNi00MDJjLWE4NTMtNjFjMjU4YzQ2OTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmVkYmFiYzgtYzgzNi00MDJjLWE4NTMtNjFjMjU4YzQ2OTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Alfred Hitchcock gives a tour of the film in this trailer for the Special Edition DVD and Blu-Ray release.", "uploadDate": "2009-10-09T13:15:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000026/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cary Grant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053125/characters/nm0000026?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roger Thornhill"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000051/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Mason"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053125/characters/nm0000051?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Phillip Vandamm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001991/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Leo G.

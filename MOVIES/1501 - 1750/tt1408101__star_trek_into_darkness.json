I LOVED this movie. I even capitalized it I loved it so much. The play between the characters, the more human version of Spock, the absolutely delightful \"Scotty\" (although his sidekick is one of those throwaway characters I dislike) as well as a much better crafted plot this time made for a completely enjoyable movie. The action is intense, the friendship deepened between the characters, the twists and turns are a bit predictable at times, but that is reminiscent of the franchise as a whole. I am already excited for the next movie. I tremendously respected and appreciated the ties in this movie to the elements that make Star Trek great - strong story line, deep connection to the characters and a philosophical element. In some of the older Star Trek episodes the moral/philosophical element can be oppressively heavy handed. No so in the new Trek movie. The ideas of friendship, family and humanity are woven through this movie with subtly and I will outright admit I more than teared up during the climactic scene in the engine room. EVEN though I had already figured out what was going to happen, I have already come to care about, respect and enjoy the new actors in their iconic roles.\n\nSo yes, ten out of ten. And let the haters, hate. Those who can not embrace change can go sit and watch old Star Trek reruns and bemoan the 'good old days' and spout off all the reasons why 'Star Trek ain't what it used to be'!!!! \n\nI, on the other hand, will boldly go and embrace the new with a continued reverence for the old. This movie makes it possible to love both.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H12M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Blu-ray Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi410167577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDU4MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDU4MjI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY1NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "New on Blu-ray: After the crew of the Enterprise find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction.", "uploadDate": "2013-09-04T08:16:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1517976/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Pine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm1517976?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kirk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0757855/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zoe Saldana"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0757855?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Uhura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0670408/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Simon Pegg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0670408?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Scotty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1212722/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Benedict Cumberbatch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm1212722?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Khan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339304/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bruce Greenwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0339304?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Pike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1404408/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Alice Eve"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm1404408?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carol Marcus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1345890/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nazneen Contractor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm1345890?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rima Harewood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1179178/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jay Scully"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm1179178?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Lieutenant Chapin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0704270/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Zachary Quinto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0704270?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Spock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0881631/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Karl Urban"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0881631?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0158626/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Cho"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0158626?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sulu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0947338/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Anton Yelchin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0947338?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Chekov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000693/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Peter Weller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0000693?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Marcus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164929/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Noel Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0164929?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Thomas Harewood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0286022/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Amanda Foreman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1408101/characters/nm0286022?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ensign Brackett"}]}]}

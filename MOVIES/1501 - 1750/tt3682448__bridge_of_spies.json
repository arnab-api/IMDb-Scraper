Sealing the deal, was a great performance by Tom Hanks.\n\nTom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure.\n\nAnd I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being completed. \n\nWatching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly enjoyable. \n\nTotally loved Bridge of Spies, It's one of the best team ups between Hanks and Spielberg and even though Lincoln was a great movie, Bridge of Spies is everything Spielberg is capable of. So entertaining.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H22M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"Standing Man\" Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi303870745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-17T19:42:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0753314/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mark Rylance"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm0753314?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rudolf Abel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0894141/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Victor Verhaeghe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm0894141?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Agent Gamber"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0404427/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brian Hutchison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm0404427?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "FBI Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0367176/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joshua Harto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm0367176?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bates"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7146771/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rebekah Brockman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm7146771?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alison - Donovan's Secretary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1600051/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John Rue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm1600051?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lynn Goodnough"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0752407/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Amy Ryan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm0752407?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mary Donovan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6907855/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Noah Schnapp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm6907855?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Roger Donovan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0518511/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Domenick Lombardozzi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm0518511?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Agent Blasco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2795735/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mark Fichera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm2795735?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "FBI Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000158/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tom Hanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3682448/characters/nm0000158?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "James B.

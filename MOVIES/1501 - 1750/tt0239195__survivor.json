This is awesome, and in my personal opinion I think the people on this version are a lot more likable, except for three (Jerri, Kimmie, and Debb).  The new version is filled with likable people, who you really want to get far in this game. Among my favorite survivors are Rodger, Elisabeth, Alicia, and really everybody else. Each episode is filled with adventure, even more than the original.  I remember watching the original and towards the beginning I thought it was a bit boring with all those people who I didn't know, but once I watched it, I was hooked.  With this one, from the VERY first episode, i was hooked.  This is a great television show, and I can't wait to find out what happens next!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Survivor: Jeff Probst Assesses The Cast", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi295812377", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhYThiYzQtYWI2Mi00OTYwLTljOTQtNTg1YmRkZDI3OTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhYThiYzQtYWI2Mi00OTYwLTljOTQtNTg1YmRkZDI3OTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Survivor: Jeff Probst Assesses The Cast", "uploadDate": "2019-03-16T06:25:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0698251/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeff Probst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0239195/characters/nm0698251?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "597 episodes, 2000-2020"}]}]}

Even some said acting was kind of bad. Well I think the total opposite of this. And I cannot see why anyone would think otherwise. This movie as basic as the plots and story lines were, totally kept my interest. I think it's Jon Favreau's best movie ever. It's a masterpiece. This could be a cult classic for Father's Day, like It's A Wonderful Life is for Christmas. Of course the general sway of Hollywood shun's on a great family life. However Jon Fav didn't give a crap and he decided to celebrate how to celebrate living again. Yeah not much going on but if you don't feel good after watching this then you have a crusty heart and your problems have deep rooted issues. \n\nI thought this was probably one of the better movies I have seen all year. Personally. I believe we really - really need more movies like this to remind us about how precious life really is and how to enjoy special moments just eating a real beignet from New Orlean's French Quarter, and in search of the perfect Cuban sandwich recipe, and perfecting the ultimate beef brisket slider. I totally was impressed by this movie for it's full hour and fifty minutes. I loved a great - feel good - movie - - I recommend for any dad and most everyone to see it This will surely restore a sense of how important a support group of family and good friends can be. Great job Jon Favreau! I kind of thought you were like Hollywood stuck up before seeing this movie. Now I know you are a real guy and cool ass family man.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3075386649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMjcxNjY2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI2NDkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMjcxNjY2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI2NDkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A chef who loses his restaurant job starts up a food truck in an effort to reclaim his creative promise, while piecing back together his estranged family.", "uploadDate": "2014-06-08T12:30:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269463/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jon Favreau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2883512/characters/nm0269463?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carl Casper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0134072/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bobby Cannavale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2883512/characters/nm0134072?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tony"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424060/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Scarlett Johansson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2883512/characters/nm0424060?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Molly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005527/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sof\u00eda Vergara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2883512/characters/nm0005527?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Inez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0781238/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amy Sedaris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2883512/characters/nm0781238?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0992289/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Russell Peters"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2883512/characters/nm0992289?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Miami Cop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3561592/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Will Schutze"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2883512/characters/nm3561592?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mr. Bonetangles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6418382/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jose C.

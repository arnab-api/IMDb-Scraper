I loved it but it felt strange to me because my grandmother after 22 years of widowhood, had remarried to an African American man. He had become a blessing in my grandmother's life and in ours. How could Spencer Tracy of all people be against the union? After the movie we went to dinner and my grandmother answered all my questions with a single answer that's been with me always and that sometimes explains absurdities like Charlottesville 2017 - \"Society, humanity doesn't evolve all at the same time\" Of course Grandma', you were right. Watching Guess Who's Coming To Dinner in 2017 was an experience. Is not that Spencer Tracy is against their union, - Tracy was only worried to what his daughter was going to face 1967 - He was thinking like a father and not like a thinking, evolved liberal. On the other hand, Roy Glenn, Sidney Poitier's father objects to his son marrying a white girl. Sidney Poitier stops him by saying \"Dad, you see yourself as a colored man, I see myself as a man\" Was it as didactic as it sounds in 1967? Who cares? The message was delivered - I also was so moved to see Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy together for the last time and they knew it was for the last time. Sidney Poitier is superb as the messenger who points at the absurdity of racism. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is a delicious document of its day.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1499989273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZjZWE3YWEtMGI5Ni00ZDZkLTk4NzgtMjMzMmZiMjcwMTdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZjZWE3YWEtMGI5Ni00ZDZkLTk4NzgtMjMzMmZiMjcwMTdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this classic starring Sidney Poitier", "uploadDate": "2009-11-08T06:18:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000075/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Spencer Tracy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0000075?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt Drayton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000031/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Katharine Hepburn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0000031?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christina Drayton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0445523/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cecil Kellaway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0445523?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Monsignor Ryan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0322658/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Roy Glenn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0322658?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mr. Prentice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0160417/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Virginia Christine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0160417?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hilary St. George"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0709872/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Barbara Randolph"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0709872?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dorothy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372784/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tom Heaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0372784?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Peter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0553075/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Skip Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0553075?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Delivery Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001627/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sidney Poitier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0001627?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Prentice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396455/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Katharine Houghton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0396455?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joey Drayton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0723968/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Beah Richards"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0723968?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mrs. Prentice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0762567/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Isabel Sanford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0762567?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tillie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0370465/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alexandra Hay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0370465?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Carhop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0552121/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "D'Urville Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0552121?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Frankie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0310976/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Grace Gaynor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061735/characters/nm0310976?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Judith"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["12 December 1967 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"], "Filming Locations": ["Maxwell Galleries, 551 Sutter Street, San Francisco, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$4,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Gross USA": ["$56,666,667"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$56,666,667"], "Production Co": ["Columbia Pictures", "Stanley Kramer Productions"], "Runtime": ["108 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Mono"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

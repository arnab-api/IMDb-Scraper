I was a Mike Myers fan, but AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY looked like the stupidest and least creative movie of the year. But after hearing of a few of the hilarious scenes of the movie, I decided to test my faith in Myers and give it a try. It turned out to be one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a long time.\n\nThe swinging hipster from the 60's, Austin Powers (Mike Myers), puts himself in deep freeze for thirty years to pursue his archenemy, Dr. Evil (Mike Myers). He is thawed out in the 90's when Dr. Evil finally reappears and plans to drill a missile to the center of the earth and destroy the planet core, and then the world. Austin Powers, with the help of his true love Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), must find a way to stop Dr. Evil and shag Vanessa. But Dr. Evil has some very dangerous customers working for him, such as Number Two (Robert Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Mustafa (Will Ferrell) and his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who thinks his father should just kill Austin rather than make a complicated plan to get rid of him.\n\nThe plot of this movie is a big spoof of movies such as the JAMES BOND films, so it's not expected to be anything but funny, which it certainly is. Don't listen to people who say this is for middle-school kids, people of all ages can enjoy this movie. It should also be said that Dr. Evil is a terrific character because, in addition to being very funny, is the stereotype spy-movie bad guy.\n\nThe acting in this movie is pretty good. Mike Myers plays both Austin Power and Dr. Evil, two very different characters, very well. Elizabeth Hurley does a very good job as Austin's girlfriend. Both Seth Green, who I think has a long, successful career ahead of him, and Mindy Sterling are very funny. Robert Wagner and Michael York, two Hollywood veterans, do good jobs with the small parts they have. Will Farrell is underplayed in this movie, but it very funny in the scene he is in. The Fembots, by the way, are terrific.\n\nThis movie is destined to become a movie classic, and \"Yeah baby!\" will be a catch phrase that will be remembered years from now. Austin Power and Dr. Evil are both stereotype symbols of past movies. Basically, these two guys are symbols of American film, at least for that particular genre. Don't expect much out of this movie except for a good laugh and a good time and you won't be disappointed.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi884474137", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNjZDQ0YTktODI5OS00OWRkLThiYWUtNDE1MTBiZWJhZWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpoYW5uYXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNjZDQ0YTktODI5OS00OWRkLThiYWUtNDE1MTBiZWJhZWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpoYW5uYXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from New Line Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:15:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000196/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mike Myers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0000196?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Austin Powers"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0000196?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Evil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001868/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael York"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0001868?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Basil Exposition"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001822/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robert Wagner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0001822?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Number Two"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007197/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Fabiana Udenio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0007197?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alotta Fagina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0227051/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paul Dillon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0227051?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Patty O'Brien"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002071/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Will Ferrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0002071?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mustafa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0757155/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Anastasia Sakelaris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0757155?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "60s Model"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005195/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Monet Mazur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0005195?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mod Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000167/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Elizabeth Hurley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0000167?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Vanessa Kensington"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000211/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mimi Rogers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0000211?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mrs. Kensington"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001293/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Seth Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0001293?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Scott Evil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0827565/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mindy Sterling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0827565?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Frau Farbissina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0621008/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Charles Napier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0621008?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Commander Gilmour"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0725286/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joann Richter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0725286?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "60s Model"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0012708/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Afifi Alaouie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118655/characters/nm0012708?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "60s Model"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["2 May 1997 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Austin Powers"], "Filming Locations": ["Santa Clarita, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$16,500,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$9,548,111,", "4 May 1997"], "Gross USA": ["$53,883,989"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$67,683,989"], "Production Co": ["Capella International", "Gratitude", "Juno Pix"], "Runtime": ["94 min", "68 min", "(TV)"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

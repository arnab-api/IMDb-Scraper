Every episode of Bewitched had ,in different orders and combinations, the same formula of Endora zaps something to muck up Darrin, and it pays off in Darrin's favour; witchcraft of some sort interferes with Darrin's work and he gets fired, then re-hired, when the witchcraft again pays off, or is foiled. While in the meantime, Gladys Kravitz, Mrs Stavens, or some unsuspecting extra is baffled by it all, and theres always some unbelievable explanation at the end of it all which the long suffering cast members swallow. With that in mind, its bizarre that it still rates in re - runs, and its bizarre that I've taped about 7 blank tapes worth of the show from  TV that I watch again and again. I can't get enough of it. So. obviously the show has a lot of appeal which allows viewers to look beyond, or perhaps enjoy the formula. I think the appeal lies in alot of things. First, the magic is a huge and fascinating drawcard. Wouldn't we all love to be able to make things appear and disappear with a twitched, and wouldn't we all love Barbara Eden as our Genie who's madly in love with us? We all would (males, anyway RE Barbara Eden), and thats what draws us to the shows. Its also brilliant and magical itself to see the special effects being done nearly forty years ago without computers or complex editing machines. That really put a smile on my face. The characters were all so far - out an exotic, all kind of like British aristocrats who had lost all air of conservatism, and lived carefree lives zapping from the Riviera to lunch in Shanghai. They were so funny, fantastic and appealing. I loved the conflict too; Endora and Darrin, Darrin and Larry; Darrin and Serena etc. And the actors of course were all brilliant, and having a tremendous time playing their roles, and fun roles they were. The chemistry on set between York and Montgomery was so believable and real, the flamboyance and gestures of Endora and Dr Bombay was loads of fun, and the comic timing of York was always perfect. Yes, Betwitched and Jeannie have to be my two favourite TV shows of all time, because they're just unpretentious, lightweight and appealing entertainment, and thats why they've lasted so long, because who would take a show about witches seriously anyway. And thats its charm."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bewitched", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2513419545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZmMTZmMDktNWEwZC00YzA0LWE2OGItMDBhYjA5NjUxNDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZmMTZmMDktNWEwZC00YzA0LWE2OGItMDBhYjA5NjUxNDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Bewitched", "uploadDate": "2019-04-06T23:02:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000548/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elizabeth Montgomery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057733/characters/nm0000548?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Samantha Stephens"}, {"url": "#", "name": "254 episodes, 1964-1972"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0924668/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "David White"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057733/characters/nm0924668?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Larry Tate"}, {"url": "#", "name": "191 episodes, 1964-1972"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001547/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Agnes Moorehead"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057733/characters/nm0001547?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Endora"}, {"url": "#", "name": "254 episodes, 1964-1972"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0948685/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dick York"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057733/characters/nm0948685?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Darrin Stephens"}, {"url": "#", "name": "170 episodes, 1964-1969"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["17 September 1964 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Witch of Westport"], "Filming Locations": ["Blondie Street, Columbia/Warner Bros.

In between commercials for these two shows, they occasionally show commercials for iZombie, but I've always ignored them. Eventually over time I start noticing them more and more and I was getting really intrigued. After my friend, who's also big comic book/manga nerd like I am, recommended me to watch iZombie, I decided to finally give it a chance.\n\nI was hooked on the first show. The atmosphere is dark and playful at the same time, the dialog is quick and witty, and the plot is crazy! Girl scratched by a zombie becomes a zombie herself and can only feed her hunger with brains. She gains the memories and experiences of the eaten brain for a certain amount of time and uses this skill to help her detective friend solve their deaths. OMG who thinks of this stuff?!?!\n\nIt's not just the stereotypical crime at the beginning of the show, everything comes together at the end, almost everyone looks like a model kind of show. I mean it is, but they do it soooo much better than most shows I've seen. The show continues along at a great pace, the characters are so well developed and intriguing that I wish I knew them in real life, and they keep surprising me with each show. The brain eating aspect really brings some incredibly situations and first person views of the victims and I think that it really adds to the originality of the show.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer - State of the Dead", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi672248601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxNDEwNTkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg5Nzc3NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxNDEwNTkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg5Nzc3NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 2 trailer for iZombie on the CW.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-12T11:29:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0570860/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rose McIver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3501584/characters/nm0570860?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Olivia Moore"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2015-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3418510/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rahul Kohli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3501584/characters/nm3418510?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ravi Chakrabarti"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2015-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1044403/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Anders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3501584/characters/nm1044403?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Blaine DeBeers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "70 episodes, 2015-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0961093/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bryce Hodgson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3501584/characters/nm0961093?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Don E"}, {"url": "#", "name": "52 episodes, 2015-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0329511/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Malcolm Goodwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3501584/characters/nm0329511?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Clive Babineaux"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2015-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0118682/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robert Buckley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3501584/characters/nm0118682?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Major Lilywhite"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2015-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1425528/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aly Michalka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3501584/characters/nm1425528?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peyton Charles"}, {"url": "#", "name": "56 episodes, 2015-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1340738/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jessica Harmon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3501584/characters/nm1340738?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dale Bozzio"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 2015-2019"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["17 March 2015 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["iZombie"], "Filming Locations": ["Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada"], "Production Co": ["Spondoolie Productions", "Vertigo Productions", "Warner Bros.

What I wasn't prepared for was the fact that a large part of the grossness was not actually shown, but rather spoken of and indirectly seen through bandage attachments. At some points it was very Hithcockian in the fear was instilled indirectly. Graphs showed how the surgery would be accomplished; only bits of the surgery were actually shown; the graphic defecation scene was verbalized and intimated. Very Hitchcock were the master of suspense a tad more mad. However, the scariest part of the film was Dieter Laser's performance. I can't recall ever seeing a mad scientist on film that projected madness and insanity as deeply as Mr. Laser\u0085\u0085..Every time he was on screen you could feel your skin crawl with fear. Brilliant performance, mainly because it went to the edge of \"over the top\" but never actually got over the top. I've also read reviews which damned the actresses for not being \"good actresses\". A bunch of hooey for sure from those observers. I'd like to see them top the girls \"tongue in cheek\" performances. I never for a moment didn't see fear in their eyes, which btw is also another means of showing more fear than the actually surgery which was done while the cast was under anesthetics. In the beginning of the film you could feel the chemistry of the girls as they giggled about in their hotel room. A definite chemistry; one which would be needed as they got closer to each other at the Dr.'s house. Hats off to this film for sever reasons; suspense, fear and scare without an overload of blood and gore as in other films. Think of the Akitamura's job of convincing us that he was frightened, angry and scared in his native Japanese tongue, while again having tongue in cheek fears to contend with of his own character. Bottom line: An original, at the edge, horror film. Where does on go after that\u0085..kudos to the cast for braving out a fully developed and overly imaginative film\u0085\u0085\u0085..and to Mr. Six for following through. Can you imagine the sales pitch he had to prepare? Besides, our news media shows more graphic crap than this on their 24/7 newscasts (eg. There was more gore with Kadhafi killing, etc.)"}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Human Centipede", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4206561049", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Njg1OTkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU3NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Njg1OTkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU3NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two stranded young women are the missing pieces in a demented surgeon's twisted plan.", "uploadDate": "2010-04-13T07:19:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0489504/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dieter Laser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1467304/characters/nm0489504?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Heiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2460100/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ashlynn Yennie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1467304/characters/nm2460100?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0505022/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Andreas Leupold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1467304/characters/nm0505022?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Det.

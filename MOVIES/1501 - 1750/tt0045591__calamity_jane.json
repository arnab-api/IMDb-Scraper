I was left with an unknown women who had come to watch the next showing. (Something unheard of in this day!) The sheer joy of the singing, dancing and innocence of a time past is something that is sorely missed today.\n\nDoris Day's Calamity Jane is a story of love between men and women and women and women during a time when this love was innocent and people did not worry that someone might look at it in a sexual way. Women could hold hands and hug to support each other in happiness as well as grief.\n\nSongs like 'Secret Love' and 'Take Me Back to the Black Hills' are beautiful even to the audiences today. this type of music will never die."}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Calamity Jane", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2881224985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTZhODRiOWYtNmQ5Ny00Y2VkLThlYjgtZGNkZDcyYzMwOTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTZhODRiOWYtNmQ5Ny00Y2VkLThlYjgtZGNkZDcyYzMwOTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:59:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000013/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Doris Day"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0045591/characters/nm0000013?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Calamity Jane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0572885/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Allyn Ann McLerie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0045591/characters/nm0572885?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Katie Brown"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0921879/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dick Wesson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0045591/characters/nm0921879?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Francis Fryer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424793/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chubby Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0045591/characters/nm0424793?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rattlesnake"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0444476/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Howard Keel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0045591/characters/nm0444476?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wild Bill Hickok"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0137023/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Philip Carey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0045591/characters/nm0137023?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lieutenant Danny Gilmartin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0367670/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paul Harvey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0045591/characters/nm0367670?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Henry Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0730344/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gale Robbins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0045591/characters/nm0730344?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Adelaid Adams"}]}]}

Once it was over I realized how smart of a decision it was. I read a review of the film that said something along the lines of, \"the trouble with this film being 3 hours is that you want to watch it for several more.\" I couldn't agree more with that statement. The story, along with its characters, moves the film along to the point where it didn't feel like 3 hours. \n\nThis film was probably the most emotionally intense and powerful movie I've seen in a very long time. You believed everything you were seeing and it forced you to feel it along with the characters. As much that has been written about this film, the acting can not be overstated. These two actresses are a revelation in this movie. \n\nIt seems that whenever the topic of homosexuality is covered by a film it usually contains some sort of hate crime or bias against homosexuality somewhere in the story that the film's characters have to face and overcome. What's refreshing about this film is that there is a dash of that but its in the beginning of the film and never becomes the focus of the conflict with the characters. The film acknowledges that bias is there but brushes it aside to say that there is something bigger and more important at play with the characters. Really nice to see that in a film.\n\nThis movie ranks as one of the best films I've seen this year and am so happy I had a chance to see it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT3H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bande annonce [OV]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3132668697", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI3OTE2NDUtOTdlMi00OGI3LWIyMGUtZjc0NGFmMTRhZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI3OTE2NDUtOTdlMi00OGI3LWIyMGUtZjc0NGFmMTRhZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-05-16T13:29:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2244205/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "L\u00e9a Seydoux"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm2244205?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0444248/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Salim Kechiouche"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm0444248?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Samir"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1595165/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Catherine Sal\u00e9e"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm1595165?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "M\u00e8re Ad\u00e8le"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2488931/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mona Walravens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm2488931?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5398167/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Laheurte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm5398167?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Thomas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0683632/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Beno\u00eet Pilot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm0683632?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Beau P\u00e8re Emma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5692633/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fanny Maurin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm5692633?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Am\u00e9lie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6014922/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Samir Bella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm6014922?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Samir"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2650819/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm2650819?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ad\u00e8le"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0714534/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aur\u00e9lien Recoing"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm0714534?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "P\u00e8re Ad\u00e8le"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2950607/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Benjamin Siksou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm2950607?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Antoine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2300160/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alma Jodorowsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm2300160?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "B\u00e9atrice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0517974/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Anne Loiret"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm0517974?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "M\u00e8re Emma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3582738/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sandor Funtek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm3582738?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Valentin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6014921/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Maelys Cabezon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2278871/characters/nm6014921?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Laetitia"}]}]}

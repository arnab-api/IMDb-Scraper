I can't stop watching it. I love how you get to have an all access pass, so you can see what the charter guests are seeing and what a life of luxury they have. But also that you get to see what happens \"Below Deck\", what there going through and what romance is in the air. What I think I like about it the most is that you get to see the different sections of the crews, and that they put in what the person is saying at that moment which is always funny. I must say though I do like Kate and Ben they are so funny together, which makes it have a great vibe, especially when it gets really irate in the kitchen.

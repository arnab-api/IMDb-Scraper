The series is well-written, and each character has a great deal of personality\u2014the viewer is able to grow with the characters as they continue their assignments throughout the series. That being said, the other actors deserve applause as well.\n\nI would definitely recommend this program to other fans of mystery and suspense... I think this series is a bit under-appreciated where I am (I'm not from Sweden), and it deserves more publicity here, although it isn't as recent as many other shows.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352195/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Haber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0907683/characters/nm0352195?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Martin Beck"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 1997-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0376190/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rebecka Hemse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0907683/characters/nm0376190?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Inger"}, {"url": "#", "name": "34 episodes, 1997-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0622266/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "M\u00e5ns Nathanaelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0907683/characters/nm0622266?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Oskar Bergman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2006-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0386335/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ingvar Hirdwall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0907683/characters/nm0386335?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Grannen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 1997-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0675409/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mikael Persbrandt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0907683/characters/nm0675409?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gunvald Larsson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 1997-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0406191/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter H\u00fcttner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0907683/characters/nm0406191?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Oljelund"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 1997-2009"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Sweden"], "Language": ["Swedish"], "Release Date": ["25 April 1998 (Germany)"], "Also Known As": ["Beck"], "Filming Locations": ["Ullswater, Penrith, UK"], "Production Co": ["Filmlance International AB"], "Runtime": ["90 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9"]}}

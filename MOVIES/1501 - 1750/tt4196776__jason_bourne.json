The Bourne Legacy (2012) saw the movie go in another direction with Jeremy Renner in the lead instead of Matt Damon however this was met with disappointing results. Jason Bourne sees Matt Damon slip back into one of his famous roles albeit some time has since passed.\n\nFollowing the events of The Bourne Ultimatum which saw Jason Bourne slipping away after successfully exposing Operation Blackbriar, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) lives off the grid and makes a living participating in illegal bare knuckle fighting rings. Bourne is still troubled by memories of his past as a CIA black ops operative. Meanwhile in Iceland, former CIA operative turned computer hacker Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) uncovers Bourne's recruitment into the Treadstone program and his father's role in the program while hacking into the CIA's mainframe systems to expose the CIA's black ops program. The intrusion is brought to the attention of the CIA's head of the Cyber Ops Division Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander), and CIA Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) who also seemingly has a shady agenda. When Nicky travels to Greece to find and inform Bourne, they find themselves hunted by CIA operatives, including a ruthless assassin known as the Asset (Vincent Cassel). Jason Bourne must revisit his old life and uncover another conspiracy which he thought was well and truly behind him.\n\nIt was fantastic to see Paul Greengrass return to the director's chair to revisit the Bourne universe as well as Matt Damon making a welcome return as Jason Bourne, the role that added another string to his bow as an excellent actor. While I couldn't fault Matt Damon, it was like I was revisiting old ground with this movie. Tommy Lee Jones, Alicia Vikander, Julia Stiles, Riz Ahmed and Vincent Cassel round out the supporting cast just fine.\n\nWhile there's plenty of action sequences which are a staple for the Bourne series, Jason Bourne seems to focus on the action and I felt that the spirit of the original trilogy was missed with the intelligent story lines which made all three of the original movies very memorable when first released and to this day all three movies have earned a spot in my list of favourite movies of all time. Jason Bourne seemed to be like a popcorn movie to appeal to the audiences to who like to suspend their disbelief and enjoy the non-stop action.\n\nWhile I had a good time in the cinema watching Jason Bourne, I fear that another Jason Bourne movie may be one too many which could tarnish the fond memories of the original Bourne trilogy. Perhaps it may be time to leave Jason Bourne alone.\n\n7/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "In Theaters 7.29.16 Watch Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1805498137", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MTA5NDk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODIxMTIzOTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MTA5NDk1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODIxMTIzOTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Jason Bourne, now remembering who he truly is, tries to uncover hidden truths about his past.", "uploadDate": "2016-07-01T04:46:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000354/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt Damon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm0000354?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jason Bourne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2539953/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alicia Vikander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm2539953?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Heather Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005466/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Julia Stiles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm0005466?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nicky Parsons"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1017951/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ato Essandoh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm1017951?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Craig Jeffers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0131966/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bill Camp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm0131966?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Malcolm Smith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0475218/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Stephen Kunken"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm0475218?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Baumen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3515690/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kaya Yuzuki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm3515690?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hacker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4547572/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Lizzie Phillips"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm4547572?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cyber Hub Tech"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000169/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tommy Lee Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm0000169?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "CIA Director Robert Dewey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001993/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vincent Cassel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm0001993?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Asset"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1981893/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Riz Ahmed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm1981893?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aaron Kalloor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0791864/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Scott Shepherd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm0791864?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Director NI Edwin Russell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0452385/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Vinzenz Kiefer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm0452385?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Christian Dassault"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4956036/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ben Stylianou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm4956036?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Greek Van Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3668828/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Matthew O'Neill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4196776/characters/nm3668828?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lead Hub Tech"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "China", "Spain"], "Language": ["English", "Greek", "German", "Japanese"], "Release Date": ["29 July 2016 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Untitled Matt Damon/Bourne Sequel"], "Filming Locations": ["Las Vegas, Nevada, USA"], "Budget": ["$120,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$59,215,365,", "31 July 2016"], "Gross USA": ["$162,434,410"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$415,484,914"], "Production Co": ["Universal Pictures", "Perfect World Pictures", "The Kennedy/Marshall Company"], "Runtime": ["123 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Atmos", "Datasat", "12-Track Digital Sound", "Dolby Digital", "Auro 11.1", "(only in China)", "DTS", "(DTS: X)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

I never read the book HJNTIY (seemed pretty self explanatory by the title alone) and I wasn't really sure how it could be made into a film, but I'll say I thoroughly enjoyed myself.\n\nThat being said, this is a CHICK FLICK--not a date movie. So don't be surprised by all the negative reviews written by guys--of course they can't stand it, and I definitely wouldn't try dragging your boyfriend to go see it for Valentine's Day...this is a movie you want to see with the girls. I wasn't that interested in seeing it, but I was talked into it and it was the perfect 2 hour distraction. The cast is fun to watch--Jennifer Anniston, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly are delightful on screen together, and I even take back all the bad things I've said about Ben Affleck--I thought he was a perfect fit for this movie.\n\nIt's also a very funny movie--I'm one of those people who love going to a packed theater where everyone laughs on cue and claps at the end, and this was one of those experiences. Some of the lines are priceless, and a couple of the funniest scenes in the movie involve \"street interviews\" \u00e0 la Sex and the City Season 1. It's just an easy, fun, entertaining film--just relax and enjoy yourself, and don't try to hold this movie to a standard that it wasn't designed to meet. I'd go see it in a packed theater if you can, otherwise wait for the DVD and have a girls' night in!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H9M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "He's Just Not That Into You: Theatrical Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1239875865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTY4MTUxMTA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYyNzM3MQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTY4MTUxMTA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYyNzM3MQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the first theatrical trailer for He's Just Not That Into You, directed by Ken Kwapis.", "uploadDate": "2008-05-31T15:08:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2079681/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Morgan Lily"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm2079681?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "5 Year Old Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1244249/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michelle Carmichael"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm1244249?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1394752/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sabrina Revelle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm1394752?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Consoling Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2035353/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alia Rhiana Eckerman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm2035353?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sorority Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1036015/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Renee Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm1036015?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sous Chef"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3227662/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sachiko Ishida"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm3227662?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tokyo Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1034414/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Carmen Gloria P\u00e9rez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm1034414?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Army Recruit"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1894152/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "D\u00e9l\u00e9 Ogundiran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm1894152?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "African Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2152695/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Trenton Rogers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm2152695?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "6 Year Old Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2774121/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jasmine Woods"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm2774121?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Crying 20-Something"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2419994/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Zoe Jarman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm2419994?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sorority Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0672181/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Julia Pennington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm0672181?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sous Chef"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3259032/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chihiro Fujii"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm3259032?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tokyo Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2515610/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Claudia DiMartino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm2515610?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jogger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2649909/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Traycee King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1001508/characters/nm2649909?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Army Recruit"}]}]}

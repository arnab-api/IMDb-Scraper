A Prehistoric Age Where Humans Still Live... Apparently For Now!", "reviewBody": "The Croods, a name most bizarre to be given as a title of a movie, but the content, just fantastic! I may even add to say that Dreamworks has lived up to its expectations in delivering exceptionally amazing animated movies and their latest release, The Croods is no exception. The story begins by introducing us to a rather diverse family of a couple, their three children and an old grandmother(who just wouldn't die) and setting is a prehistoric age where they are supposedly the only living humans. The movie then goes on to bring an extra character just named \"Guy\" and his sidekick Belt(an animal) who goes on to proclaim that the end of the world is near and their only hope for survival was to aim for the mountains far ahead. A simple plot it seems no doubt, but the way the movie was crafted was just fantastic and if that wasn't enough, you might actually find yourself laughing a couple of times no matter what age you might be of. There might be many movies out there to be watched but \"The Croods\" is a film which is guaranteed to be enjoyed. It might not be the best film out there, but it certainly is a great one which has its own comedic and adventurous moments, a movie for the whole family out there and to all those who prefer watching it in 3-D, the effects are seriously good in this film and your choice would be a valid one. All in all, no matter what age you may be, \"The Croods\" might just bring back a smile or a few memories of those old childhood fantasies where anything was possible.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi126265113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world.", "uploadDate": "2012-12-08T09:53:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000115/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicolas Cage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0481499/characters/nm0000115?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Grug"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005351/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ryan Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0481499/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001458/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cloris Leachman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0481499/characters/nm0001458?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0761498/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Sanders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0481499/characters/nm0761498?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Belt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1297015/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Emma Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0481499/characters/nm1297015?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eep"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001416/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Catherine Keener"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0481499/characters/nm0001416?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ugga"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0241173/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Clark Duke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0481499/characters/nm0241173?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Thunk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0858378/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Randy Thom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0481499/characters/nm0858378?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sandy"}]}]}

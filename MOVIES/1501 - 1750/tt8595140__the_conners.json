I loved the original and still enjoy the reruns so much. However, the new show is simply not good. I love Laurie Metcalf but she is horribly overplaying her character much like she did in the original runs last season. I don't know who told her this was the way to go, but it's awful. Goodman looks bored and seems like he's forcing his lines. Sara Gilbert seems to be trying to fill the void left by Roseanne and she's just not up to it. Darlene was an interesting teenage character but her flat, monotone one-liners just don't deliver. As for the rest of the cast, there's too many extra characters and very little character development. If I'm supposed to care about any of the grandkids, they need to be featured more than a couple minutes each week. What made the original so good was the relationships - Roseanne was at the center of that with Dan, Jackie, Becky and Darlene. I gave it a chance, I think I'll stick with the reruns and take a pass on this.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Conners", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2601565465", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JhZjA2M2ItNDM2Yi00NDVmLWE4Y2MtN2ZhYzI0MmQ5OWY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JhZjA2M2ItNDM2Yi00NDVmLWE4Y2MtN2ZhYzI0MmQ5OWY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Conners", "uploadDate": "2019-04-11T02:44:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000422/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Goodman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8595140/characters/nm0000422?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dan Conner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "51 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004960/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sara Gilbert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8595140/characters/nm0004960?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Darlene Conner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "51 episodes, 2018-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0279896/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael Fishman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8595140/characters/nm0279896?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "D.J.

And while our taste in movies is different and comedy is something that will be viewed differently by anyone watching, I think it's a big mistake calling out people and suggesting things like that.\n\nIn other words: Whether you liked this or not, it doesn't mean people who disagree with you got paid or have no sense of humor. Having said and written all that, I think Melissa McCarthy is doing a great job. And as a friend of mine said (though I did like \"The Heat\" with her and Sandra Bullock too), this one steps up on the stunts front too. There are some genuine great action scenes in this.\n\nAnd Jason Statham is terrific in spoofing himself (to put it PG words, something you won't get in this movie by the way - there's a reason it's rated R and it's mostly because of the language used). But in general this is really a movie about women. And I love the fact, that they are getting some really good well written roles in this. You might not agree with the lines/humor, but you can't fault the fact, that they put them out there taking lead and being really good at it.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I'm almost surprised nobody called out \"Feminism\" with this one (something that seems to be popular in 2015, see also Mad Max Fury Road). But if you don't mind (and you shouldn't), and this kind of does meet your sense of humor, you will have a great time", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi707571993", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster.", "uploadDate": "2015-04-01T06:15:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000179/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jude Law"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3079380/characters/nm0000179?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bradley Fine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0565250/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Melissa McCarthy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3079380/characters/nm0565250?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Susan Cooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1635000/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Miranda Hart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3079380/characters/nm1635000?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nancy B.

This show was well written, had great plots to every episode and season it had and great acting overall! Before this series ever started the actors who were on this show were in mostly in a lot of TV-shows that lasted one season and probably not as much episodes until this show came along! The show NYPD Blue is set against the gritty and volatile backdrop of New York City, NYPD Blue powerfully portrays realistic characters devoting themselves to the pursuit of justice while struggling to sustain an ever-elusive sense of humanity. In spite of -- or perhaps because of -- the bleakness of the streets, the chaos of the squad room and the fragility of their own private lives, the members of the 15th Precinct share a strong commitment to the job and each other. Veteran actor Rick Schroder brought a new energy and intensity to the series with his arrival. This fantastic series first premiered on ABC back in September 1993 and has gone on until March 2005 when the series ended after 12 seasons. The show has been nominated for an Emmy 84 times and won 20 Emmy awards out of those 84 times the series has been nominated. I can believe it has been on the same time-slot and night on ABC through out it's 12 season run! Dennis Franz is my most favorite actor out of the entire show! This is one show that TV fans should remember always!\n\nUser Rating: 10/10\n\nBOTTOM LINE: BRILLIANT!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "NYPD Blue: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2410545433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJlNTYyMjgtZTQ1NS00MjhkLWI2NjQtNDRhMDVmODU2NmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJlNTYyMjgtZTQ1NS00MjhkLWI2NjQtNDRhMDVmODU2NmZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:31:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001240/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dennis Franz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106079/characters/nm0001240?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Det.

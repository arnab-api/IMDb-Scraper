Some thirty years later I happened to catch it in reruns once more, and was surprised to discover how clever it actually was. It was a zany and often silly lampoon of heroic war and spy movies. In order to appreciate the plots and humor, viewers actually require a fair amount of background knowledge on World War II. Examples include: the difference between a POW camp and concentration camp; German laws which prevented military personnel from joining the Nazi party (thus Klink, Schultz and the other Luftwaffe personnel were not Nazis); the difference between the Abwehr and the SS; the location and importance of such facilities as Peenemunde\u0085the list goes on and on. The show was also avant-garde for its time, one of the first in which an African-American was portrayed in a wholly positive light, as a competent and intelligent human being. The actors were all talented and worked well together.\n\nAs for those who say there is nothing funny about Nazis \u0096 Ha! Please go get back in the line where God is handing out a sense of humor. Hogan's Heroes had the taste and good sense to hint at the truly dark side of that regime, without ever focusing upon it. Most notably, it stayed away from the Holocaust, understanding that there really was nothing amusing about that. The rest of Nazism \u0096 the crude methods, the arrogance, the bureaucratic incompetence \u0096 deserves nothing but mockery. Read a good history of the Third Reich and you come away wondering how those bozos ever managed to stay in power for twelve years. These were the folk who exiled, imprisoned or executed almost all of Germany's best and brightest, from Einstein to Rommel. Nazism was never good at anything beyond terrorizing the weak and murdering those who got in its way. Step outside of modern concepts of political correctness and you realize that Hogan's Heroes gave the National Socialists exactly the sort of notoriety they deserved: dismissive ridicule. Hitler must be writhing in his grave.

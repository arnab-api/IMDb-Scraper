What can I say?", "reviewBody": "I kept waiting to engage with either the characters or with one of the beasts. Such an engagement was not forthcoming. I like Eddie Redmayne, so it is nothing to do with him. So much emphasis on creating this alternate world that the basics of filmmaking appear to have been sacrificed. Never does anyone look into you, the screen, and speak. There is never any eye contact. You do not feel attached to Eddie's character. Even my children were squirming in the seats and looking around bored. They wanted food and said they were hungry. The movie therefore appears to fail both children and adults like me. My 12yo son who is a mega Harry Potter fan could not engage with the movie. \"I like reading J K Rowling's books but I am not sure about this one\" is what he said. What he means is that, after having watched the movie, it has put him off the book as well. \n\nI got up to get food for the kids, they followed me and were more keen on ice creams and sweets rather than getting back to the screen to what happened next. So much for fantastic pointless beasts. If you liked Harry Potter then that is not a guarantee that you will like this one. That is for sure. If you liked The Lord of Rings and sat through the trilogy, then you may have what it takes to sit through this one. Perhaps looking at this as a movie nothing to do with Harry Potter might help. If your children do not get attached to the movie then don't be surprised.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT2H12M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1553839641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTExOTQ2NDg2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYyOTYxMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The adventures of writer Newt Scamander in New York's secret community of witches and wizards seventy years before Harry Potter reads his book in school.", "uploadDate": "2016-09-28T21:16:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1519666/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eddie Redmayne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm1519666?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Newt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2580832/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Scott Goldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm2580832?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Customs Official"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0846925/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tristan Tait"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm0846925?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Reporter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0384732/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tom Clarke Hill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm0384732?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Photographer 2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2239702/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Katherine Waterston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm2239702?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0283945/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dan Fogler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm0283945?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jacob Kowalski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7500671/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Faith Wood-Blagrove"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm7500671?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Modesty Barebone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3270798/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cory Peterson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm3270798?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bank Employee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0714866/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sam Redford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm0714866?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Customs Official"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0072758/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tim Bentinck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm0072758?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Witness"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0268199/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Colin Farrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm0268199?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Graves"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0799252/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Matthew Sim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm0799252?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Photographer 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0608090/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Samantha Morton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm0608090?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mary Lou"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3009232/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ezra Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm3009232?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Credence Barebone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2893183/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jenn Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3183660/characters/nm2893183?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Chastity Barebone"}]}]}

There's none of that here.\n\nPolice work as shown in Hinderland is a mix of frustrating conversations that get you nowhere and hours of research (done by supporting leads) coupled with some lucky breakthroughs. If you are nit-picky about police procedures or a fan of CSI-type of story telling, you might be bored and annoyed by this show.\n\nIf you like shows about detectives unraveling the master plans of highly intelligent super-villains you might be a bit disappointed as well - the crime in this show is very down-to-earth and true to statistics (no Hanibal Lecter type of stuff).\n\nEven if initially the series seems slow, and not your usual cup of tea, it's worth to give it a closer look, as it just might make you a better person.\n\nEach episode (the length of a standalone film) tells a different story of 'who's done it', yet the finger never seems to be pointed at a particular person. The show offers a fuller picture and helps you understand the motivations and circumstances that lead to the crimes.\n\nThe show is really compassionate, there are no bad guys and good guys, like many of the cop-stories out there would have you believe, everyone is broken and suffering, and oh so human. A true lesson in empathy.\n\nI love how Tom Mathias (the main character) treats the people he arrests - even when tackling them to the ground he still sees them as people, seems to understand their pain and even (gasp!) tries to comfort them.\n\nWhen the stories come to an end, there is no patting on the back, solving of a case does not feel like a victory of justice, there are no moral lessons to learn, other than \"suffering creates more suffering\".\n\nIt's a slow, beautifully shot show which by offering you an escape from reality throws you knee-deep in it's slimy gutter instead.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hinterland: Series 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1144368153", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU5NmI2ZGItMDcyNi00ZGI1LThkODMtZWEwODViMjkxNGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU5NmI2ZGItMDcyNi00ZGI1LThkODMtZWEwODViMjkxNGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Hinterland: Series 1", "uploadDate": "2014-07-28T04:29:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364348/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Harrington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2575968/characters/nm0364348?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "DCI Tom Mathias"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2906227/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alex Harries"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2575968/characters/nm2906227?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "DC Lloyd Ellis"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0400449/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aneirin Hughes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2575968/characters/nm0400449?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chief Supt Brian Prosser"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1036545/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mali Harries"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2575968/characters/nm1036545?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "DI Mared Rhys"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1770416/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hannah Daniel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2575968/characters/nm1770416?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "DS Sian Owen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0604685/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Geraint Morgan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2575968/characters/nm0604685?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Iwan Thomas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["Welsh", "English"], "Release Date": ["30 August 2015 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Hinterland"], "Filming Locations": ["Aberystwyth, Cardigan, Wales, UK"], "Production Co": ["All3Media International", "BBC Wales", "Fiction Factory"], "Runtime": ["90 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

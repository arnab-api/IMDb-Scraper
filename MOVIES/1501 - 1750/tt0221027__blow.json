Sure, it isn't a \"great\" movie, but when was the last time you saw 5 great movies in a row?  A great movie comes along once in a blue moon, depending on your definition of great.  I personally was very engaged in the plot.  Johnny Depp gives a tour-de-force performance, fully engaging himself in the character.  I'm sure he did lots of research on George Jung and tried to mimick his every mannerism, because this was far from a half-baked effort.  Then again, I don't ever recall Johnny Depp doing a movie where he didn't put his full enthusiasm into the role.  The movie has many tragic moments and many funny moments.  The film is a little over 2 hours long, but the time flew by in a breeze.  I was so enlightened that I'm anxious to do some research on the real George Jung.  I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, and they could've chosen a much better actress, but she's only in the film about 20 or 30 minutes, so she isn't given enough time to ruin the film.  Paul Reubens gives a surprisingly earnest performance as a flamboyant, bisexual hairdresser.  It's too bad he's caught up in all this controversy, because he seems to have sufficient range as an actor.  I loved hearing all the great classic rock songs in the soundtrack, and every time I watch the film the songs get stuck in my head and I start singing them for days on end.  \n\n\"Blow\" is a touching drama that doesn't try to exploit the world of drugs, nor condemn it.  After seeing George's tragic outcomes as a world-class coke dealer, I doubt anyone would want to get in or get back into the \"business,\" but that doesn't necessarily mean the message is preachy. \n\n My score:  8 (out of 10)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Blow", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3504603417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzUyMmUwMWQtYWFkZC00YTAxLWJiNjUtMTA0NzY0OTZlMGFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzUyMmUwMWQtYWFkZC00YTAxLWJiNjUtMTA0NzY0OTZlMGFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema", "uploadDate": "2008-05-29T15:22:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Jung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004376/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Franka Potente"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0004376?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Barbara Buckley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000607/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paul Reubens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0000607?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Derek Foreal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0193295/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cliff Curtis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0193295?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Escobar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0839486/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ethan Suplee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0839486?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tuna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0300824/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kevin Gage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0300824?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Leon Minghella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416596/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jesse James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0416596?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young George"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0274971/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dan Ferro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0274971?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cesar Toban"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004851/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0004851?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mirtha Jung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0341737/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rachel Griffiths"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0341737?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ermine Jung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003244/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jordi Moll\u00e0"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0003244?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Diego Delgado"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0762153/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Miguel Sandoval"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0762153?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Augusto Oliveras"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000501/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ray Liotta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0000501?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Fred Jung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001611/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Max Perlich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0001611?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kevin Dulli"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0702296/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Miguel P\u00e9rez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0221027/characters/nm0702296?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alessandro"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "Mexico"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["6 April 2001 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Blow: One Man's Life"], "Filming Locations": ["Spring Street Towers - 650 S.

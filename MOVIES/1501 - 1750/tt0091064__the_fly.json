Technically, this is a remake, but with a genius like David Cronenberg in the director's chair, it's obvious that this isn't anything like the uninspired and irritating remakes that are being released nowadays (\"The Amityville Horror\", \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"\u0085). Cronenberg's interpretation of this ultimate terror-tale differs greatly from the original. In fact, the only resemblance is the basic premise of a fusion between an obsessive scientist and an ordinary housefly. Goldblum is terrifically cast as the brilliant, but slightly confused mastermind Seth Brudle, whose lifework are \"telepods\"; funny looking machines capable of transmitting matter through space. Journalist Davis, with whom he has a romantic adventure, closely observes the progress of his work but when he teapot's himself through space, the catastrophe happens. Mentally as well as physically, Brudle undergoes a horrible transformation into a fly and it cannot be stopped. \"The Fly\" is a very devastating film. Powerful enough, but not exactly pleasant to look at. Like only the greatest directors can pull this off, Cronenberg overwhelms the audience with a sublime mixture drama, misery and repulsiveness. You feel as helpless as the characters themselves and you painfully wait for the unhappy ending to come! The screenplay is filled with genuine metaphors and the romance between Goldblum and Davis is beautifully illustrated. The special effects, mainly created by Chris Walas (who went on directing the 1989-sequel) are definitely still staggering and they don't look the least bit dated by today's standards.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Fly (1986)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3631351577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2FkNTc3OTItMzdhNy00NjhkLWJjOTMtZDg0NDBlZmE1ZjUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2FkNTc3OTItMzdhNy00NjhkLWJjOTMtZDg0NDBlZmE1ZjUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this remake", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T16:00:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000156/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeff Goldblum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0000156?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Seth Brundle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0315288/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Getz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0315288?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stathis Borans"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0137967/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Leslie Carlson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0137967?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. Cheevers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0178680/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Copeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0178680?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "2nd Man in Bar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0493706/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Carol Lazare"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0493706?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nurse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000133/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Geena Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0000133?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Veronica Quaife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0100205/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joy Boushel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0100205?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tawny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0161546/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "George Chuvalo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0161546?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000343/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Cronenberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0000343?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gynecologist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0382087/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shawn Hewitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0091064/characters/nm0382087?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Clerk"}]}]}

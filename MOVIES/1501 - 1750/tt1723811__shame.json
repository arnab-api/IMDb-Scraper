But something prevents Brandon from having a relationship that lasts more than four months, this incapacity is due to the fact that Brandon is a sex addict: to casual encounters with strangers and prostitutes, to pornography (both during and after working hours), to masturbation. And to some extent he seems to have his addiction under control, until her sister Sissy arrives unexpectedly looking for a place to live for a while.\n\nBritish director Steve McQueen delivers a fascinating character study that explores how modern life (in which new technologies play a major role), increasingly isolates people and makes them unable to establish emotional bonds with others. In Brandon's case, a hunter in search of pleasure and not love, the arrival of his sister will turn him into a prey of his own emotions and will make him face his reality.\n\nOne aspect that has caused controversy is the way so raw and explicit to show Brandon's sexual encounters, however this becomes a necessary element, since it is through them that you can see Brandon's need and desperation as Sissy is more involved in his life. Special mention deserves the dynamics established between them, since it is fully nuanced and can even be uncomfortable to witness but is devastatingly emotional (especially in the last minutes of the story).\n\nHowever, the most important element for the success of the film lies in the performances: in the hands of less committed actors Brandon and Sissy's conflicts would be unconvincing, but McQueen wisely chooses Michael Fassbender (both had previously worked together on Hunger), who literally bares body and soul to take Brandon's emotions to the limit and does it so impressively in a brave and courageous performance (and unfortunately the Academy possibly considered too intense for consideration in their nominations). Meanwhile Carey Mulligan proves to be one of the young actresses with the best prospects and acting range nowadays: her rendition of the classic song New York, New York is an utter delight as well is one of the best scenes in the film.\n\nShame, in the end (as in most character studies) does not seek to create empathy for the characters, but rather wants us to reflect and ask ourselves how we would react in similar situations.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi404332057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDA1NDQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY2MzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDA1NDQ3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY2MzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Brandon's carefully cultivated private life -- which allows him to indulge his sexual addiction -- is disrupted when his sister Cissy arrives unannounced for an indefinite stay.", "uploadDate": "2011-11-19T11:35:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1055413/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Fassbender"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm1055413?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brandon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4479160/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mari-Ange Ramirez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm4479160?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alexa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2718512/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nicole Beharie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm2718512?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Marianne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3799669/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hannah Ware"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm3799669?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Samantha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3740207/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rachel Farrar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm3740207?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rachel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659547/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carey Mulligan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm1659547?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sissy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2803689/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Marta Milans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm2803689?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cocktail Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0599017/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Montano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm0599017?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3046705/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lucy Walters"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm3046705?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Woman on Subway Train"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0197647/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James Badge Dale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm0197647?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0542022/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alex Manette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm0542022?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Steven"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2136389/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Elizabeth Masucci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm2136389?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Elizabeth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4781761/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Loren Omer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm4781761?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Loren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4782212/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lauren Tyrrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm4782212?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hostess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2973456/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jake Siciliano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1723811/characters/nm2973456?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Skype Son"}]}]}

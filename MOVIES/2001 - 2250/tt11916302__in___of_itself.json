We loved the show live and think the movie has found a way to capture the essence of the live performance. My wife had said it best this is her review:\n\nIt really is a raw and powerful show. I don't think anyone can watch this show and not be affected by it. So many of the people in the audience were deeply moved, and some were brought to tears. Derek is deliberate in his presentation, he is piercing in his gaze, he uses silence as well as words, and when he does speak, you are hanging on every word. Oh, and he's incredibly talented too. I chose I AM a dreamer. Edmund chose I AM a trickster, but seeing what some people chose for themselves was at times beautiful, funny, and incredibly sad. Fantastic show. 522 shows.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3826172185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY3YjYxNDgtYmU5ZC00YjQ5LWFjODEtZjI1YjE5OThmYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY3YjYxNDgtYmU5ZC00YjQ5LWFjODEtZjI1YjE5OThmYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-01-12T16:19:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3668380/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Derek DelGaudio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11916302/characters/nm3668380?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3021088/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason England"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11916302/characters/nm3021088?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Player"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12265231/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Prakash Puru"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11916302/characters/nm12265231?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Player"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2469515/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bay Dariz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11916302/characters/nm2469515?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Tomorrow"}, {"url": "/title/tt11916302/characters/nm2469515?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Yesterday"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11978191/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hal Schulman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11916302/characters/nm11978191?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "The Dealer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1559425/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Matthew Holtzclaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11916302/characters/nm1559425?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Player"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12265232/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alexandra DelGaudio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11916302/characters/nm12265232?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Self"}]}]}

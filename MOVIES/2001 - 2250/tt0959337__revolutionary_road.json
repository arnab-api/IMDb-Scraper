They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Revolutionary Road: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4269277209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODc2MzI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0MDg5MQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODc2MzI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0MDg5MQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the first theatrical trailer for Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.", "uploadDate": "2008-10-09T13:09:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000701/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kate Winslet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm0000701?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "April Wheeler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0280199/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christopher Fitzgerald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm0280199?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Party Guest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2016364/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Neal Bledsoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm2016364?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Party Guest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3009512/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Samantha Soule"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm3009512?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Party Guest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0742081/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sam Rosen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm0742081?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Party Guest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2210606/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gena Oppenheim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm2210606?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Party Dancer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2405035/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Joe Komara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm2405035?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Party Dancer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1092086/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "David Harbour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm1092086?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Shep Campbell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000138/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm0000138?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Frank Wheeler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0745751/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jonathan Roumie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm0745751?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Party Guest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1677477/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marin Ireland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm1677477?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Party Guest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2193669/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Heidi Armbruster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm2193669?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Party Guest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659592/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maria Rusolo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm1659592?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Party Dancer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3132202/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kathryn Dunn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm3132202?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Party Dancer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3230272/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Allison Twyford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0959337/characters/nm3230272?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Party Dancer"}]}]}

These are people who have been told all their lives by their culture, by TV and movies, that sex is, on the one hand, the most perfect form of communion and connection with another human being; and, on the other hand, that it is the ultimate in transcendent and transformative experiences.  Instead, they discover to their horror that even during sex they still feel nothing. They crave connection, they are starved for a glimpse of transcendence, but no matter what they do, no matter who they do it with or how often, while their bodies may feel passion, their minds and hearts remain cold and empty.\n\n In the more recent movie Pleasantville, the Jennifer/Mary Sue character is unable to feel anything either, and remains stubbornly black and white no matter how much sex she has, until her brother suggests that \"maybe it isn't the sex\" that is the key to moving from black and white to color, from passionlessness to feeling.  Unfortunately, in Crash, there is no one to suggest to David and Catherine Ballard that maybe it isn't through sex that they will find the transformation and connection they are craving.  So they instead seek more and more extreme forms of sexual stimulation, only to be disappointed again and again.\n\nJames is hurt in a car crash, and during his stay in the hospital he meets Helen (who was in the other car) and later Vaughan, a man who like James and Catherine is in desperate search of feeling, only he looks for it in the violence of car crashes.  With Helen, at first James, then Catherine too is drawn into Vaughan's world, where sex and death (eros and thanatos for you Freudians) meet in the twisted metal of wrecked cars and the mutilated bodies of the victims of fatal car crashes and the survivors of near-fatal ones.\n\nThey attend staged recreations of famous car crashes, like the one that killed James Dean.  They have sex in crashed cars, and start touring crash sites on the freeway as a form of foreplay. They begin to watch films of crash tests and fatal race accidents like other people would watch erotic films, and to have sex with people whose bodies have been mutilated by car crashes.\n\nBut not even the horror of mutilation or the adrenaline rush of near-death experience can lend James and Catherine's desperate coupling the depth of feeling that they so desperately crave.\n\nLike all the people who buy expensive automobiles to give them a feeling of power and independence, only to discover that no matter how snazzy their car is, they still feel powerless and unhappy, James and Catherine have bought into one of our culture's Big Lies, that sex is the answer.  This film shows us that it is not.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000652/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Spader"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0000652?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Ballard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000480/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elias Koteas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0000480?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vaughan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000275/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rosanna Arquette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0000275?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gabrielle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0432223/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Yolande Julian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0432223?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Airport Hooker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0441754/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Judah Katz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0441754?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Salesman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0765474/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ronn Sarosiak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0765474?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "A.D."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0661508/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Markus Parilo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0661508?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Man in Hanger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003834/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Stoneham Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0003834?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Trask"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000456/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Holly Hunter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0000456?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Helen Remington"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000679/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Deborah Kara Unger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0000679?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Catherine Ballard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534132/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter MacNeill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0534132?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Colin Seagrave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0841940/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cheryl Swarts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0841940?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Vera Seagrave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0309914/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Nicky Guadagni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0309914?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tattooist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0052103/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Boyd Banks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0052103?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Grip"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0690923/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alice Poon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115964/characters/nm0690923?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Camera Girl"}]}]}

action, political adventure at its best!", "reviewBody": "\"Blood Diamond\" is the kind of action film that makes you think that 'a moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life...' \n\nThe film opens in Sierra Leone, 1999 when Civil war rages for control of the diamond fields\u0085According to devastating reports, these stones are being used with both rebels and government forces to purchase more weapons and finance civil war\u0085 \n\nDanny Archer\u0097crazy for diamonds like everybody else\u0097believes this pink gem holds his ticket out of this godforsaken continent\u0085 He is a smuggler, a former mercenary and weapons trader from Zimbabwe who bribes all, and supplies arms to both sides\u0085 He gets Solomon Vandy\u0097captured by government troops\u0097out of jail only because he overhears that the fisherman might have found a clear massive stone about the size of a bird's egg\u0085 \n\nVandy\u0097forced apart from his family and sent off to work as a slave in the minefields\u0097has hided the enormous 100 carat diamond from his captors and buried it in a secret place within the jungle\u0085 His son Dia is taking away by a brainwashing militia called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) turning him with lies, drugs, and liquor, into a cold-blooded murderer\u0085\n\nDanny makes a deal to help the noble fisherman find his family if Vandy will lead him to the diamond\u0085 The majority of the story is their journey across the war torn country\u0085 \n\nLeonard DiCaprio is both ruthless and charming as the cynical soldier of fortune who knows an opportunity when it presents itself\u0085 But he also is aggressive and selfish willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants\u0085 He illustrates the black side of the dirty diamond trade\u0085 On his trek to find the stone, Archer's eyes are opened to some enduring values that surpass his own self-profit\u0085 \n\nDjimon Hounsou eventually realizes that Danny's connections and money are his only hope\u0085 He plays a helpless character totally passionate as the resolving and fiercely determined father desperate to learn the fate of his family\u0085\n\nConnelly is an idealist who wishes to display corruption\u0085 She thinks that with Archer's help she can get a unique story line surrounding the civil war but also revealing corporate malfeasance and cover-up behind the diamond trade\u0085 \n\nIt is also good to mention Arnold Vosloo in the role of Colonel Coetzee, head of the army unit also trying to claim the diamond\u0085 He's a great character actor and remains a powerful presence and one of the screen's most efficient scene-stealer\u0085 \n\nNominated for five Oscars, \"Blood Diamond\" is an action, political adventure at its best!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H23M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Blood Diamond",

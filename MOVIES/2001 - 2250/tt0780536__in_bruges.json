Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.\n\nThe dark comedy built around the existential quandaries of hit men has been done to death over the years. If last summer's \"You Kill Me\" was the relentlessly dark and relentlessly sitcom-y take on the genre, then \"In Bruges\" is the hipster art film take on the theme. McDonagh deserves all the credit in the world for breathing life into the stale story by texturing the tonal shifts with crisp digital camera-work (that is surprisingly haunting), deep character development, and by creating a wonderful sense of place. Imagine a Graham Greene novel (\"Brighton Rock\" specifically comes to mind) modernized by David Mamet. The dialog is super smart and wickedly un-PC while the comedy parts are as gut-busting as the crime thriller parts are suspenseful.\n\nMcDonagh has also brought together an outstanding cast who thrive in the material. Farrell defies all odds and manages to be as sympathetic in the dramatic parts as he is charmingly sarcastic in the comedic parts. Brendan Gleeson gives a fantastically nuanced portrayal as Farrell's mentor and friend. Meanwhile, Ralph Fiennes channels the scary-as-hell energy he's used previously in \"Schindler's List\" and the recent \"Harry Potter\" films in a limber subversion that is a frighteningly fun to watch. The supporting cast is to die for, with Jordan Prentice spot-on as a coked-up dwarf actor shooting an abhorrent art film on the streets of Bruges, and Clemence Poesy coyly seductive and unforgettable as Farrell's unlikely local love interest.\n\nUltimately \"In Bruges\" meanders down too many cobblestone paths, and one scene near the end involving a bell tower stretches credibility but adds necessary dramatic effect. Certain plot elements will turn off a large segment of the viewing audience. However, those with the right mindset will be greatly rewarded. \"In Bruges\" is hilarious, contemplative, sometimes scathing, often nihilistic, but marked by a shockingly hopeful undercurrent while tones shift and the colors of the human condition undulate in McDonagh's insightful light. The arrival of a commanding talent has been heralded...in Bruges.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "In Bruges", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi783417625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTM2NjA5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyOTM2NjA5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In Bruges Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-12-15T15:46:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0077397/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elizabeth Berrington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0077397?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Natalie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2063846/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Olivier Bonjour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm2063846?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Film Director"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2652511/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ann Elsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm2652511?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Overweight Woman #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269431/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jean-Marc Favorin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0269431?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Policeman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0322407/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Brendan Gleeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0322407?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ken"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411964/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Zeljko Ivanek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0411964?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Canadian Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534777/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Anna Madeley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0534777?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Denise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0993242/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0993242?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Chloe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1900328/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rudy Blomme"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm1900328?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ticket Seller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0233025/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mark Donovan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0233025?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Overweight Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0268199/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Colin Farrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0268199?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ray"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000146/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ralph Fiennes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm0000146?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Harry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1101713/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Eric Godon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm1101713?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Yuri"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1754166/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sachi Kimura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm1754166?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Imamoto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2841589/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Louis Nummy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0780536/characters/nm2841589?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Harry's Child #3"}]}]}

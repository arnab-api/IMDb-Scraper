Everyone kept on saying it was hilarious, original, and had great music. So I watched on of the episodes and I thought \"eh... it's OK. I still like Pinky and the Brain better\" but then later on went back to it and started the show from the beginning to the end... and wow. Phineas and Ferb is a great show.\n\nThe humor in Phineas and Ferb is good because it can be intelligent at times and doesn't rely on slapstick humor all the time. Like in one scene where a person is standing in the water, holding a globe in his hand, and a boat called \"Nosebud\" is rushing towards him at high speeds. The man quietly says \"nosebud...\" and then drops the globe. When I saw that scene I yelled \"CITIZEN KANE?!?!\". There are a lot of pop-culture references in Phineas and Ferb but it doesn't make them obvious. Instead of throwing the pop-culture references in your face like some other shows do.\n\nThe title characters Phineas and Ferb are stepbrothers. Phineas is the dorito head shaped kid, and Ferb is the tall silent one. The interesting thing is that Ferb never talks except for on rare occasions which makes him one of the best characters. For a character who rarely ever shows emotion in facial expressions he is actually one of the more expressive characters because when he does show expression you know it must be something important.\n\nPhineas and Ferb can probably be easily recognized by the fact that it has a song in every episode. Now when most cartoons do this it usually ends up becoming annoying. Usually the songs are low quality and too similar to each other. HOWEVER Phineas and Ferb actually has good songs in it AND the songs are never the same. Each song covers a different genre/style of music so expect country, reggae, rap, electronic, blues, jazz, psychedelic, punk etc.. \n\nThe plot follows a pretty repetitious pattern from episode to episode. Phineas and Ferb (if you didn't know) are pretty much what all little kids wanted to be. You know when you were a little kid and you dreamed about flying to moon, finding treasure, or building robots? Phineas and Ferb do that. Their plans are always vast and over-the-top. Such as completing a real scale replica of the Eiffel tower... in one afternoon. Candance is Phineas' older sister and Ferb's stepsister. She is constantly trying to prove to mom that Phineas and Ferb are always building things but the creations Phineas and Ferb create always magically disappear. And this is because of plot B. Plot B follows the adventures of Perry the Platypus (Phineas' pet). Perry is actually a secret agent who is constantly battling Dr. Doofenshmirtz. Their battle always ends up in somehow destroying Phineas and Ferb's devices/buildings/plans etc. in some way or another. The interesting thing is that Perry and Doof don't really hate each other. When they aren't fighting each other they actually just hang out. When Perry doesn't show up to thwart Doof's evil plans Doof is actually upset or when Doof replaces Perry with a new nemesis Perry becomes sad.\n\nOverall a really great show. The first season is a little bit repetitious compared to the other seasons, however the other seasons usually have some episodes that break up the standard formula.

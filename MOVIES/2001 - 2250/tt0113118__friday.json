Then when I finally bought the DVD of the film, I was very pleased. The movie was a great comedy, filled with laughs and an interesting story.\n\nThe whole movie's story takes place on a Friday. It's about two friends (played by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker) who try to get through a regular Friday in their urban neighborhood. Little do these two fellows know, this Friday will be anything but regular. This Friday will be the most different Friday they will ever experience.\n\nThe best thing about the movie is Chris Tucker. He gives a very comical and humorous performance as Smokey, the weed-addicted home boy. I've heard that Chris Tucker didn't star in the sequels to this film, so I refuse to watch the sequels. Ice Cube was pretty good in the movie too, but I wish he didn't have to star in the Tucker-less sequels, since Cube & Tucker go well together as buddies.\n\nThe soundtrack of the movie is great as well. There are lots of hip hop songs played in various parts of the film. I particularly like the songs from Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, and Ice Cube himself.\n\nThe bad part about the movie is that the story itself seems to be over-simplistic. I think a way to improve the movie would have been to add more sub-plots, therefore making the movie contain many funny twists. But still, the movie is pretty good as it is.\n\nTo sum up, this is a great movie to watch on a day when you're in need of some good comedy. I'd recommend watching the movie on a good ol' Friday night!\n\nI give this movie a 7/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001084/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ice Cube"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0001084?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Craig Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000505/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nia Long"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0000505?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Debbie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0936762/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Witherspoon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0936762?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mr. Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005093/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Regina King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0005093?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dana Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0522324/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Faizon Love"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0522324?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Big Worm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0575168/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Angela Means"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0575168?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Felisha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0728249/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ronn Riser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0728249?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Stanley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185272/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tony Cox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0185272?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mr. Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000676/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chris Tucker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0000676?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Smokey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001474/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tom Lister Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0001474?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Deebo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0395428/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anna Maria Horsford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0395428?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mrs. Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005294/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Paula Jai Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0005294?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0690770/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "DJ Pooh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0690770?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Red"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0721990/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Vickilyn Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0721990?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103307/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kathleen Bradley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113118/characters/nm0103307?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mrs. Parker"}]}]}

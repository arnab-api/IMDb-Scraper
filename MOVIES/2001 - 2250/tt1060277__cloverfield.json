This, much like Spielberg's \"War of the Worlds\" and \"Children of Men\", completely immerses you in this incredible situation with absolutely no knowledge to comfort you. It's very disorienting, which adds to the experience; you never figure out what the hell is going on but you're so into survival that you put it past you. You're placed with a bunch of characters whom you get to know and eventually must join in their frenzied search for a friend while being subjected to some horrifying imagery and new threats.\n\nThe effects look great and realistic thanks to the hand-held camera, which isn't too bad-looking if you manage to get a seat further from the screen. The filmmakers came up with some really great creature designs that were menacing yet very much original. If you're bound to be upset over seeing a movie with a lack of music, then stay for the credits, during which a fantastic suite of music composed by Michael Giacchino titled \"Roar! (Cloverfield Theme)\" plays.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic time at the movies. A little more background on the monster would be nice, though the absence of this information is intentional. Everyone in the theater was rooting for a sequel; maybe a second set of footage is found elsewhere? Or perhaps there is more the the viral marketing -- what exactly were Slusho and Tagruato? Also be prepared to suspend some disbelief, but considering the movie is about a monster destroying New York City, that shouldn't be too difficult.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Cloverfield", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi78774553", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlmYWM0NGMtMDE2OS00YjUxLTkzNGQtZTIyZTM3MmIxMGIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdvb3N0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTlmYWM0NGMtMDE2OS00YjUxLTkzNGQtZTIyZTM3MmIxMGIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdvb3N0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Cloverfield Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-12-01T09:41:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0135221/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lizzy Caplan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1060277/characters/nm0135221?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Marlena Diamond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2554352/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "T.J.

When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a \"male stripper movie,\" like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a \"gay cowboy movie.\" This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, \"Worst movie ever.\" On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.\n\nTo state it simply, MAGIC MIKE is a BOOGIE NIGHTS-lite, which isn't a bad thing considering how utterly dark and depressing BOOGIE NIGHTS gets in its second half. The first half of MAGIC MIKE is light and breezy and quite funny. In fact, most of the jokes in here are funnier than most modern comedies try to achieve. We are introduced to this world that is fascinating because of how surprisingly mundane and economics-centered it is. The stripping sequences, filled with energy and sexiness, are mostly played for laughs. We get exposed to a lot of male asses, ripped abs, and pelvic thrusts, but it's all in good fun. Then, things slowly start to take a dark turn in the second half. It isn't hard to imagine people thinking, \"Wait. Isn't this a stripping movie?\" Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea.\n\nThe cast is terrific all around. Channing Tatum is very good as the lead role, playing comedy and drama effectively. However, I want to give a huge shout out to Alex Pettyfr and Cody Horn, both pulling off terrific performances in their substantial roles. Pettyfr, in particular, I never really liked in the films he starred in before, but he is just phenomenal in this film. Horn, on the other hand, seemed to come out from nowhere, but her rapport with Tatum is terrific. Let's also not forget about Matthew McConaughey. Even though he isn't in the film that much, he steals every single scene he's in. He's just that good.\n\nMAGIC MIKE will either surprise or disappoint you, depending on what your expectations are. Still, it's a film BOTH genders can enjoy, and it shouldn't be limited to \"a movie for the ladies.\" MAGIC MIKE is funny and dramatic when it needs to be, but the main reason it succeeds is because of the cast. Overall, MAGIC MIKE is a very good film. Just don't expect a lot of stripping.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi889627417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdiNzgzZTMtOTI2YS00NTA5LWJkMTYtZDQ3ZDFmM2EzZGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdiNzgzZTMtOTI2YS00NTA5LWJkMTYtZDQ3ZDFmM2EzZGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Mike, an experienced stripper, takes a younger performer called The Kid under his wing and schools him in the arts of partying, picking up women, and making easy money.", "uploadDate": "2012-04-22T06:11:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000190/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matthew McConaughey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1915581/characters/nm0000190?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dallas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1601397/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Olivia Munn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1915581/characters/nm1601397?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joanna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0446457/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "James Martin Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1915581/characters/nm0446457?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1730221/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Reid Carolin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1915581/characters/nm1730221?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1825981/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "George A.

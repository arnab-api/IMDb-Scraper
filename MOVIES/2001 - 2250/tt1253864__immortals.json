The story is very loosely based on Greek mythology , creating a potpurr\u00ed of Gods and legends , mingling elements of various myths . As screen writers state that they chose to change many aspects of the ancient Greek stories to reflect the fact that the Greeks themselves often revised their mythology to conform to new ideas and knowledge . In Classical Greek mythology , Immortals were members of the second order of divine beings, descending from the primordial deities and preceding the Olympian deities . Based on Mount Othrys, the Titans most famously included the first twelve children of the primordial Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Heaven). They were giant deities of incredible strength, who ruled during the legendary Golden Age , and also composed the first pantheon of Greek deities . As they had overthrown the primordial deities, the Immortal Titans were overthrown by younger gods, including many of their own children - the Olympians - in the Titanomachy (or \"War of the Titans\"). There were twelve Olympian gods and goddesses and they were immortal and unkillable as well . The Greeks may have borrowed this mythology from the Ancient Near East . There were only 12 titans in the myths and they were immortal and invincible . There was a war in the heavens and the Titans lost . Zeus then threw them into Tartarus , which is represented as a mountain in the movie, but in the old myths was a cave at the center of the Earth with minor similarities to Hell, to be imprisoned for all eternity . The picture takes Greek Gods here and there , as in the myths , Theseus (Henry Cavill , he trained for 8 hours 5 days a week to get in shape for the film) was actually King of Athens and (in some versions) a son of Poseidon (Greek god of sea and Zeus' brother, being played by Kellan Lutz), although his legal father was King Aegeus of Athens . Theseus killed the Minotaur , a creature with the body of a man and a head of a bull imprisoned in a labyrinth, depicted here as a man with a helmet made of wires and horns with the help of princess Ariadne whom he later married . In the Theseus story, Crete had its capital at Knossos, and its ruler was cruel King Minos , here Hyperion (Mickey Rourke , he chose to do this movie instead Conan , 2011) defies the Greek God , Zeus (Luke Evans ,he appeared a year earlier as Zeus' son Apollo in Clash of Titans) . Hyperion origin is from a different myth, and was the name of one of the 12 Titans . Epirus Bow doesn't exist in any mythology, but it might be inspired by the bow of Heracles aka Hercules which was used by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the great war . Other Gods appearing are the followings : Apollo (Corey Sevier) , Athena or Minerva (Isabel Lucas) who is the daughter of Zeus (or Jupiter) and Metis, a daughter of the Titans, and goddess of wisdom , Heracles (Steve Byers) ,a son of Zeus who was the only hero to ascend to Olympus to rule with the Gods and Poseidon , he is the Greek god of the sea, equivalent to the Roman Neptune . Furthermore , Sibyl (Freida Pinto, though Lily Collins auditioned for a part, but was turned down by director) was the ancient Roman title for prophetesses . \n\nBig production that blends Greek Gods , fights , feats and spectacular images by means of Computer Generator . Violent movie combines historic events , drama and breathtaking fights . The flick packs nice settings , characters with elaborate costumes and a seamless combination of practical and CGI effects . Every little scene has been given maximum detail, as gowns , environment and set design , adding too much C.G.I. backgrounds and lush frames showing overwhelming combats between Gods and humans . To achieve the effect of gods moving much quicker than humans, those scenes were shot at 1000 frames per second . Brilliant and glimmer cinematography by Brandan Galvin , being \"done in Renaissance painting style\" . Vibrating and shaking musical score by Trevor Morris . This passable picture was originally directed by Tarsem Singh , though has some flaws and gaps . Tarsem Singh described his approach to the film as being \"like Caravaggio (1986) meets The fight Club (1999)\" . He frequently collaborated with the late costume designer Eiko Ishioka , until her passing, she was the only designer he had worked with . Tarsem also made similar experiments filled with light , color and weird frames such as \u00a8The fall\u00a8, \u00a8The cell\u00a8and \u00a8Mirror , Mirror\u00a8 .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"Rage\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4119502361", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM4OTIwMzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY5MzA5Ng@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM4OTIwMzg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY5MzA5Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Immortals TV spot", "uploadDate": "2011-10-12T15:53:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0147147/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Henry Cavill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0147147?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Theseus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001151/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stephen Dorff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0001151?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stavros"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1812656/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Luke Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm1812656?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Zeus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0604784/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joseph Morgan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0604784?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lysander"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0117374/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Greg Bryk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0117374?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "The Monk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0824220/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peter Stebbings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0824220?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Helios"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1456970/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Isabel Lucas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm1456970?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Athena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0125847/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Steve Byers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0125847?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Heracles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000620/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mickey Rourke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0000620?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "King Hyperion"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2951768/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Freida Pinto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm2951768?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Phaedra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000457/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0000457?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Old Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206635/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Anne Day-Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0206635?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Aethra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0888022/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alan Van Sprang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm0888022?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dareios"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1528476/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Daniel Sharman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm1528476?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ares"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1553725/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kellan Lutz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253864/characters/nm1553725?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Poseidon"}]}]}

I used to like the Suite Life, but after its ending, I found this show was an even better replacement. So much better than awkward sitcoms from the past (such as Hannah Montana) and it is definitely geared for older teens since its main character is 18. Being 18 myself I find that the jokes are still G-rated, but just on the edge enough that young adults can fill in the blanks of the jokes (and they're actually funny believe it or not). I also think it is so much better than other sitcoms Disney channel is currently spewing out such as \"Mr.Young\" or \"Kickin' It\" as those shows are geared for preteens, have actors that are not very good, and they're not funny at all. If you're looking for the show that the Disney Channel should be clinging on to, it's Jessie. I hope it stays on air for a long time. Highly Recommended for pretty much all ages :)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Jessie", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi15449113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTMzMThkNDUtNTZhYS00Mzk1LTk2NTItMjllY2ZlZDVkMWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTMzMThkNDUtNTZhYS00Mzk1LTk2NTItMjllY2ZlZDVkMWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Jessie", "uploadDate": "2019-05-15T18:44:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2913275/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Debby Ryan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1865769/characters/nm2913275?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jessie Prescott"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2624602/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cameron Boyce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1865769/characters/nm2624602?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Luke Ross"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2857655/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Skai Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1865769/characters/nm2857655?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Zuri Ross"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2572554/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Peyton List"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1865769/characters/nm2572554?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Emma Ross"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3557613/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Karan Brar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1865769/characters/nm3557613?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ravi Ross"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0150255/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kevin Chamberlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1865769/characters/nm0150255?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bertram"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}]}

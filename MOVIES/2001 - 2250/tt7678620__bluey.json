Everything about Bluey is fantastic.\n\nIt's modern Australia without ever dipping into cork hat cliche. It's family life without anyone having to look like an idiots. There's jokes galore for the parents but without feeling forced or inappropriate. It teaches us all stuff without ever preaching. The lessons aren't just for the kids either - there's not a parent that has watched Bluey that hasn't learned something. In fact, if there is ever a hint of boredom or wanting a game to play, pop on an episode of Bluey and by the end of the 7 minutes you'll have a new game to play.\n\nEven when there was a question mark over whether Chilli was left on the fringes being forced to play the straight man, with Bandit getting all the parental glory, the writers sorted it and she got her punchlines.\n\nThe comparisons to other pre-school shows are inevitable and let's hope they continue as Bluey should finally mean we see the last for the damn pig. That pig is rude without consequence, treats her dad like an idiot, dumps on her friends, never says please or thank you and bullies her brother, Bluey and her family are the polar opposite.\n\nIf there is a downside to Bluey, it's that Bandit sets an impossibly high dad standard for us to all live up to.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4026580505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjFhYWI0YjctOTBmOS00OGEyLWFiZjItZjczMmNhZDJlZDg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjFhYWI0YjctOTBmOS00OGEyLWFiZjItZjczMmNhZDJlZDg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The slice-of-life adventures of an Australian Blue Heeler Cattle Dog puppy as she has fun with her family and friends in everyday situations.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-06T10:13:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1256136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David McCormack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7678620/characters/nm1256136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dad"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3148372/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Melanie Zanetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7678620/characters/nm3148372?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mum"}, {"url": "#", "name": "37 episodes, 2018-2020"}]}]}

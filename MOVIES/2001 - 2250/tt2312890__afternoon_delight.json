Hahn is quite great.", "reviewBody": "A charming, touching indie dramedy. I watched it mainly because I really like comedian Kathryn Hahn. I've loved her presence as a character actress since she popped up in Step Brothers a few years back, and she's stolen scenes in movies such as Wanderlust and TV shows such as Parks & Recreation since then. I'd heard it was a bad film, but I thought it was pretty good. Hahn stars as a wife and mother. Her marriage (to Josh Radnor) isn't bad, necessarily, but their sex life has kind of died. One night, on a whim, she decides to have a couples date with her best friend at a strip club (her friend swears that it gets her husband's motor running). There she meets a young stripper played by Juno Temple, and she becomes a little obsessed with the girl afterward. Not sexually, exactly, though there may be an element of that. It's kind of a motherly attention, mixed with a deep curiosity regarding the girl's highly sexual lifestyle. When she finds the girl outside of work, she's basically homeless, so Hahn takes her home, hoping to maybe glean some of her secrets. There isn't much of a plot. It's mostly just a film about people. It really gives Hahn, who is in general a supporting player, a chance to shine, and, man, does she ever. This is a fantastic performance. Temple is quite good, too. The men in the picture are a little underdeveloped. If Radnor had been more of a character, the film might have been great. As it is, it's pretty good.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi446081305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NDg2OTE4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA4NzYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NDg2OTE4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA4NzYyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Rachel, a stay-at-home mom, becomes obsessed with saving a stripper named McKenna.", "uploadDate": "2013-07-04T13:07:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1063517/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kathryn Hahn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1063517?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rachel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1075323/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cesar Garcia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1075323?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Car Wash Attendant 2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1143861/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michaela Watkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1143861?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jennie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4767832/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sawyer Ever"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm4767832?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Logan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6330027/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Makenna Cotton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm6330027?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1483930/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Javier Calderon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1483930?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Doorman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0620232/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Suzy Nakamura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm0620232?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Meredith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1745318/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bryan Lugo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1745318?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tow Truck Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3433566/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Link Ruiz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm3433566?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Car Wash Attendant 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0528331/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jane Lynch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm0528331?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Lenore"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1167794/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jessica St. Clair"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1167794?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Stephanie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1102140/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Josh Radnor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1102140?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jeff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1221047/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Keegan-Michael Key"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1221047?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1017334/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Juno Temple"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm1017334?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "McKenna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4846460/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ozioma Akagha"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2312890/characters/nm4846460?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Barista"}]}]}

Bleach. What is Bleach exactly? In simple turns it's Yu Yu Hakusho meets 7 Samurai, except substitute the 7 for a much much larger number. The story revolves around 15 year old Ichigo Kurosaki who seems to able to see dead people, except he's not as emo as that 6th Sense Kid. By a chance encounter he meets Rukia who is a Soul Reaper, or to the old fans \"shinigami\". She cannot be seen by humans, but strangely enough Ichigo and can see her and even touch her. After being completely knocked to the ground she strangely stares at Ichigo surprised and bewildered. Her job is to send souls that are worthy to the \"Soul Society\" which is a much much less divine heaven. She must also battle and defeat Hollows which are evil souls that have gone astray. A bit much? Not really, this is just the basis of the series but after episode 14 or 15 I guarantee you the excitement factor will jump through the roof. I am glad to say that Cartoon Network kept the original intro Asterisk by Orange Range, same with the ending credits. Bleach has always had the great music w/ the fashionable intros. Overall it's a mystic story with a modern day twist and am sure it'll appeal to anyone any age. The voice acting is on par and decided to use Johnny Yong Bosch, you may remember him as the Black Power Ranger or as Vash the Stampede's voice. Overall I don't see any major problems, good clean fun and clear skies ahead. Let's just hope they don't dumb down Bleach like they did Naruto. So here's to Bleach and it's successful first run on US soil..\n\nps I'm surprised they kept in the word \"Zanpakutou\", that's a very good sign.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bleach: Bleach: Uncut DVD Set 16", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2667095577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDEwYTc3YjAtY2YzNC00MWUwLWIzZTAtOGYyZWJhZTRiYTUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDEwYTc3YjAtY2YzNC00MWUwLWIzZTAtOGYyZWJhZTRiYTUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Bleach: Uncut DVD Set 16", "uploadDate": "2013-03-30T04:05:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0097765/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Yong Bosch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm0097765?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ichigo Kurosaki"}, {"url": "#", "name": "280 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1315809/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stephanie Sheh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm1315809?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Orihime Inoue"}, {"url": "#", "name": "197 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1821497/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Derek Stephen Prince"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm1821497?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Uryu Ishida"}, {"url": "#", "name": "152 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0861558/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kirk Thornton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm0861558?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Narrator"}, {"url": "#", "name": "136 episodes, 2004-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1040968/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Masakazu Morita"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm1040968?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ichigo Kurosaki"}, {"url": "#", "name": "113 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0741398/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michelle Ruff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm0741398?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rukia Kuchiki"}, {"url": "#", "name": "207 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0528936/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jamieson Price"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm0528936?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Yasutora 'Chad' Sado"}, {"url": "#", "name": "171 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935042/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Wally Wingert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm0935042?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Renji Abarai"}, {"url": "#", "name": "136 episodes, 2004-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0134269/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Steve Staley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0434665/characters/nm0134269?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Toshiro Hitsugaya"}, {"url": "#", "name": "124 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}]}

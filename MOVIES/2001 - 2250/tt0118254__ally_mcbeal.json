As a former legal clerk, I found the show quite funny at times and all the stars performed very well in their roles.\n\nCalista Flockhart was the main star. She was the intelligent lawyer  who excelled in the courtroom but her private life was a shambles. There was a lot of history between her and another lawyer Billy (played by Gill Bellows) who was now with Georgia (played by Courtney Thorne-Smith). This led to some interesting scenes.\n\nThe head of the firm was Richard Fish played by Greg Germann. Fish was only interested in the almighty dollar and didn't take life too seriously. There was also John Cage played by Peter MacNicol who was an eccentric lawyer whose courtroom antics really entertained. \n\nThe show was brilliant for it's first few years but like most TV shows, it outstayed it's welcome and lasted longer than it should have. The later episodes were very average at times. \n\nHowever, Ally McBeal was a decent show and I definitely recommend the earlier episodes."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Ally McBeal: The Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3702785305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM5YjIxNzctZDZmNi00MzVlLTkzOGItZjkzYzRkZTc0ODg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM5YjIxNzctZDZmNi00MzVlLTkzOGItZjkzYzRkZTc0ODg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "First time on DVD Trailer", "uploadDate": "2009-10-21T03:09:32Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001222/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Calista Flockhart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0001222?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ally McBeal"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1997-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005105/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jane Krakowski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0005105?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elaine Vassal"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1997-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001493/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Peter MacNicol"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0001493?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Cage"}, {"url": "#", "name": "103 episodes, 1997-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005577/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Portia de Rossi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0005577?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nelle Porter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005489/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Courtney Thorne-Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0005489?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Georgia Thomas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1997-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0355278/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Albert Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0355278?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Judge Seymore Walsh"}, {"url": "#", "name": "51 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0314524/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Greg Germann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0314524?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Richard Fish"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1997-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005423/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vonda Shepard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0005423?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vonda Shepard"}, {"url": "#", "name": "108 episodes, 1997-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004808/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lisa Nicole Carson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0004808?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Renee Raddick"}, {"url": "#", "name": "91 episodes, 1997-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005154/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lucy Liu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0005154?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ling Woo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004743/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gil Bellows"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118254/characters/nm0004743?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Billy Thomas"}, {"url": "#", "name": "68 episodes, 1997-2002"}]}]}

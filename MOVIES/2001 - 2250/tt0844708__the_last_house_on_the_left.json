The actors are also really well cast, Garett Dillahunt is truly frightening as the movie's main bad guy, Riki Lindholme portrays Sadie with true evil and is very very creepy, Monica Potter and Tony Goldwyn both pull off the typical family putting on a brave face (considering the back story which i'll not spoil for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet), that are put in a position where they have to do what they can to protect their daughter's life and their own. Sara Paxton and Martha MacIsaac also show that they are capable of a more dramatic element than just a comedy and teen movie fare, that we are used to seeing them in.\n\nThe only thing I hated about the movie was the rape scene, the build up was just so intense that I found myself covering my ears so I couldn't hear what was going on, but apart from that go see this movie if you want to see how a remake should be done.\n\nA thought provoking, pulse racing thriller, that will have you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Last House on the Left: Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1321337625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY1OTk1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4MjUyMg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzY1OTk1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4MjUyMg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After kidnapping and butchering a young woman, a gang unknowingly finds refuge with the parents of the victim -- hosts who devise gruesome revenge.", "uploadDate": "2009-01-13T16:28:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226813/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Garret Dillahunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0226813?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Krug"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185104/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josh Coxx"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0185104?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Giles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0666739/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aaron Paul"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0666739?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Francis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005321/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Monica Potter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0005321?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Emma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532900/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Martha MacIsaac"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0532900?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paige"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3218669/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Usha Khan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm3218669?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Maid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0100889/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Bowen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0100889?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Morton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1641251/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Riki Lindhome"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm1641251?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sadie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0668139/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sara Paxton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0668139?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mari"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001282/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tony Goldwyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0001282?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "John"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004829/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Spencer Treat Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844708/characters/nm0004829?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Justin"}]}]}

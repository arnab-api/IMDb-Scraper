People who are interested in watching this movie, must go into the cinema with the right expectations.\n\nPlease don't expect this power rangers movie to be as deep, as a movie like 'the dark knight', 'batman v superman' or 'shawshank redemption'. Historically speaking, power rangers had a corny production vibe to it, especially visually and this is one of the reasons kids fell in love with it. Kids at a young age, aren't as could as they are when they get older at interpreting deep philosophical messages; which is why power rangers in general isn't the type of show/movie you watch, expecting to leave the theater with a huge epiphany about life.\n\nI'd class this movie as overall fun and entertaining to watch. What I loved about it is the was never a scene whereby I felt bored. Though let me not exaggerate things and make you feel like every scene has got action in it, which is obviously not true. The point is the movie manages to keep an audience who walks into it with the right expectations, actively engaged in it.\n\nThe were moral lessons one can learn by watching the movie. Issues like how to work as a team, how to be a leader, human mortality, opening yourself up emotionally to your friends, resisting conforming to societal expectations and having an open mindset.\n\nA few downsides to this movie were the graphics kind of looked cheap -- as in the visual effects weren't as real-like, like a movie like star wars the force awakens in my opinion. The villain came off as corny and audiences who like serious movies, probably won't like this movie. Though keep in mind -- the cheap looking graphics, corny villain and sometimes lack of seriousness in this movie is what makes power rangers the franchise it is today.\n\nSo don't go into the theater expecting a movie with extremely deep philosophical points, that tells us humans are ultimately self-serving individuals etc.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer With Commentary", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3328161305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEyMGIxMGItM2RiYS00M2VkLWFkOWMtZjA5ZDM1YzlmYmQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEyMGIxMGItM2RiYS00M2VkLWFkOWMtZjA5ZDM1YzlmYmQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Director Dean Israelite supplies behind the scenes commentary while watching the 'Power Rangers' theatrical trailer.", "uploadDate": "2017-03-22T17:57:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4223882/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dacre Montgomery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm4223882?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jason (Red Ranger)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5518972/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "RJ Cyler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm5518972?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Billy (Blue Ranger)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3121384/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Becky G"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm3121384?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Trini (Yellow Ranger)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186505/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bryan Cranston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm0186505?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Zordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2397866/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matt Shively"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm2397866?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Damo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0219292/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David Denman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm0219292?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sam Scott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1420538/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Anjali Jay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm1420538?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Maddy Hart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4479367/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Morgan Taylor Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm4479367?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Harper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4305463/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Naomi Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm4305463?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kimberly (Pink Ranger)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3485108/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ludi Lin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm3485108?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Zack (Black Ranger)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006969/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Elizabeth Banks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm0006969?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rita Repulsa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352778/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bill Hader"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm0352778?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alpha 5"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4181215/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cody Kearsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm4181215?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hawkeye"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597235/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robert Moloney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm0597235?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ted Hart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4152858/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sarah Grey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3717490/characters/nm4152858?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Amanda"}]}]}

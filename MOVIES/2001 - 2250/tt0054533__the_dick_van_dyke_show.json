The man has an innate talent for comedy, timing and characters as the first show known where the characters spend half of the time hurling funny insults at their boss, and the other half showing the life of a  happily married couple very much in love with each other. This is probably the first show to show the husband at work where so many other tv husbands vanished to \"the job;\" for all we know, Ward Cleaver and Ozzie Nelson could of been embezzlers or secret agents. This show went one more level further by showing the scenes behind the writing of a comedy-variety show. Dick Van Dyke is an eternally likeable talent and Mary Tyler Moore was demurely sexy and wonderfully irresistible before her looklike cousin got a job in that Minneapolis news office. That role was a far distant cry to this one. Forget the Bradys, they were the parents I wanted; they were both wonderful, fair and funny, but who wants to have a crush on their mom ? Larry Matthews was every model son as he played the \"low-maintenance kid\" missing from shows on end. Morey Amsterdam and Richard Deacon were perfect comedy foils for each other as was Rose Marie who played eternally optimistic bachelorette Sally Rogers. Jerry Paris and Ann Morgan Guilbert were everyone's favorite neighbors. All this and appearances by Reiner himself as oft seen Alan Brady, the star of the show within the show, made this series a comedy classic even above The Cosby Show or the Brady Bunch."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Dick Van Dyke Show: The Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi35562521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTVhMTdmNzMtZDM0YS00NjBiLWE2YjMtZjkzM2Q2ZmI5NzQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTVhMTdmNzMtZDM0YS00NjBiLWE2YjMtZjkzM2Q2ZmI5NzQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for the Dick Van Dyke Show", "uploadDate": "2012-10-14T03:37:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001813/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dick Van Dyke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054533/characters/nm0001813?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rob Petrie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 1961-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0025440/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Morey Amsterdam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054533/characters/nm0025440?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Buddy Sorrell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 1961-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001546/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mary Tyler Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054533/characters/nm0001546?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Laura Petrie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 1961-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0346893/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ann Morgan Guilbert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054533/characters/nm0346893?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Millie Helper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 1961-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0547300/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rose Marie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054533/characters/nm0547300?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sally Rogers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 1961-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0558667/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Larry Mathews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054533/characters/nm0558667?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ritchie Petrie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 1961-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212586/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Richard Deacon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054533/characters/nm0212586?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mel Cooley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 1961-1966"}]}]}

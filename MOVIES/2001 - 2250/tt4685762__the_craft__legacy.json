And sure enough, the movie was a weak imitation of the original 1996 \"The Craft\" movie.\n\nWriter and director Zoe Lister-Jones failed utterly to bring something worthwhile to the screen, as \"The Craft: Legacy\" just felt like a watered down more family-friendly version of the 1996 movie. And that was just an abysmal turn for the movie to take. Especially since the 1996 movie was pretty good and impacting back in the day.\n\nI am sure that \"The Craft: Legacy\" was meant to be a continuation of the 1996 movie, but it just failed at being an original movie in its own right, and it had none of the charm, appeal or impact that the 1996 movie had.\n\nSure, if you haven't seen the 1996 \"The Craft\" then I suppose \"The Craft: Legacy\" is a good enough movie. But for us that did watch it, then \"The Craft: Legacy\" is lacking the magic, the foreboding darkness that threatened behind the alluring call of using witch magic. And more importantly, it was lacking memorable characters.\n\nThe character gallery in \"The Craft: Legacy\" felt like they were using cardboard stand-in, most of them fully devoid of backstory and personalities. Even David Duchovny's character felt like a puppet just brought in for the heck of it.\n\nNot even having the likes of David Duchovny and Michelle Monaghan in the movie could do much to lift up what was essentially a hollow and shallow movie experience.\n\nThe most interesting part about \"The Craft: Legacy\" was the person that showed up in the end of the movie, and get this, was present for a whole staggering 3 second or so! Now, I am not going to say whom it is, but yeah, you guessed it already, because it was that predictable.\n\nMy rating of \"The Craft: Legacy\" lands on a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. The movie was watchable, for sure, but this was by no means a worthy runner up to the 1996 \"The Craft\".", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Watch Now on Prime Video Cinema", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2648883481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFlZjE0YWMtYzI5ZC00YWFhLWFlNmYtZGQxNmY2MmUwZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFlZjE0YWMtYzI5ZC00YWFhLWFlNmYtZGQxNmY2MmUwZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A newcomer to a Catholic prep high school falls in with a trio of outcast teenage girls who practice witchcraft, and they all soon conjure up various spells and curses against those who anger them.", "uploadDate": "2020-10-22T23:01:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8314228/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cailee Spaeny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm8314228?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4594069/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gideon Adlon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm4594069?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Frankie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000141/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Duchovny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm0000141?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Adam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5954280/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nicholas Galitzine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm5954280?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Timmy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3610327/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Charles Vandervaart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm3610327?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jacob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000103/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Fairuza Balk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm0000103?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nancy Downs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8392427/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Chris Tomassetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm8392427?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeremy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2602721/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "James Madge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm2602721?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mr. Bly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10656367/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Zoey Luna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm10656367?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lourdes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7594279/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lovie Simone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm7594279?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tabby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1157358/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michelle Monaghan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm1157358?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Helen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5719974/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Julian Grey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm5719974?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Abe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10021823/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Donald MacLean Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm10021823?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Isaiah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7302791/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hannah Gordon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm7302791?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ashley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1032698/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kris Siddiqi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4685762/characters/nm1032698?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sex-Ed Teacher"}]}]}

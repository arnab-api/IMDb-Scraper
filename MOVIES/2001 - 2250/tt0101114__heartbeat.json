It mixes gentle story lines, beautiful scenery and hit music from the period to create a madly watchable program.  Sure it is not ground breaking and certainly would not win any awards for creativity but it provides the perfect form of entertainment for a Sunday night.  The light and easy to digest stories are just what anyone would want the night before an early morning start for work.  What makes \"Heartbeat\" so good is the likeable characters and combination of humour and action.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and never fails to have at least one scene were you couldn't fail to laugh or raise a smile.  Even though it is on 24 times a year it hasn't deteriorated into just another soap like \"The Bill\" or \"Where the heart is\" with episodes made up of mainly stand-alone parts.  It is deservedly the #1 drama on UK TV with 10 million viewers and even had a spin-off made in 2003 called \"The Royle\"."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0800749/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William Simons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101114/characters/nm0800749?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "PC Alf Ventress"}, {"url": "#", "name": "355 episodes, 1992-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0672297/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tricia Penrose"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101114/characters/nm0672297?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gina Ward"}, {"url": "#", "name": "338 episodes, 1993-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519554/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Lonsdale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101114/characters/nm0519554?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Stockwell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "259 episodes, 1993-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0562732/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bill Maynard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101114/characters/nm0562732?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Claude Jeremiah Greengrass"}, {"url": "#", "name": "155 episodes, 1992-2000"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0288621/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Derek Fowlds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101114/characters/nm0288621?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Oscar Blaketon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "342 episodes, 1992-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0430267/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mark Jordon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101114/characters/nm0430267?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "PC Phil Bellamy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "323 episodes, 1992-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0072611/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter Benson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101114/characters/nm0072611?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bernie Scripps"}, {"url": "#", "name": "235 episodes, 1995-2009"}]}]}

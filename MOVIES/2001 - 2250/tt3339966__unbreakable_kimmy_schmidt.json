I like all of the characters, with my favorite being Titus since he has some of the most memorable and hilarious lines of the show. I quickly binge watched seasons 1 and 2 in the matter of days, but it took me a few weeks to get through season 3. I wanted to like it and I was very excited to watch it, but it was honestly a big let down compared to the previous two seasons. The jokes felt forced and I was very unhappy with some of the plot decisions. It felt like major story lines were built up only to be torn apart and it was disappointing to see that happen after spending so much time invested in them. The season 3 finale was a little better and I was relatively happy with how they set up the plot for season 4, but I'm worried they'll just repeat the same mistakes as this time around. Overall, this show is an amusing, feel good comedy and it does bring a smile to my face, I just hope that the writers will have some more focus and direction in the coming seasons.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Episodes: Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi85637657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRhZDk3NmMtYTY2Ny00ODc1LTk1OTEtZDBkZmFmYTc4MWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWRhZDk3NmMtYTY2Ny00ODc1LTk1OTEtZDBkZmFmYTc4MWI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Every miracle, every song, every discovery has led to this!

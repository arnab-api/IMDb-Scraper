So I was looking forward to the second season and it did not disappoint at all! The shows good at what it aims to do. It's not a series for its deep intricate plotting. It's an exercise in character, one that happens to feature truly exciting personalities. Perhaps this is the perfect example where a shows structure is perfect with the balance of bin-gable viewing with it's blended ease. Love has a certain charm to it and each episode feels like a mini-indie movie and by episode 5 your reminded why this series is such a real pleasure to watch!

Genie Francis and Tony Geary who have become the phenomenal Luke and Laura.  Luke and Laura made General Hospital the unforgettable soap opera it is, and still today, Luke and Laura's though painful relationship, keeps viewers going through their fascinating characterization and never ending passion between them.\n\nAlan and Monica, played by Leslie Charleson and Stuart Damon, Frisco and Felicia, played by Jack and Kristina Wagner, Robert and Holly, played by Tristan Rogers and Emma Samms, Sonny and Brenda, played by Maurice Bernard and Vanessa Marcil, and Luke and Laura have showed every other soap opera the definition of a \"love story\".  Though never simple, always intense, always unforgettable.\n\nGeneral Hospital has also shown amazing technique in storylines that are not love stories.  Such as Monica Quartermaine's heartwrenching breast cancer storyline in 1994, or the amazing storyline of two little girls dying, yet only one miracle came out of it.  I could only be talking about Bobbie Spencer's and Tony Jones's daughter BJ giving her heart to Frisco and Felicia's daughter Maxie, in the last moments to save her life.  These stories touched many viewers and there are so many more.\n\nSome of the most precious moments on daytime television have occurred on General Hospital, and the highest rated moment on daytime television was Luke and Laura's wedding in 1981.  It was said to be the only wedding ever to rival Princess Diana's.  General Hospital has created feelings, storylines, and characters that go beyond words.  I thank Genie and Tony who play Luke and Laura for bringing out the fantasy we all have about how love should be.  Though they are General Hospital's greatest achievement, I don't think General Hospital's done with them yet!  And we know that Luke and Laura are not the only life changing storyline they've come up with!  Thank you General Hospital!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Promo: All Sonny's Kids Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2753150489", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVkYzFmNTAtYmJjMy00NmU3LWI0ODYtNTE3OGIyNjBhZjg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVkYzFmNTAtYmJjMy00NmU3LWI0ODYtNTE3OGIyNjBhZjg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-06-30T09:36:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001939/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maurice Benard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0001939?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sonny Corinthos"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,687 episodes, 1993-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0942583/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Wright"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0942583?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carly Corinthos"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,080 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0378697/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rebecca Herbst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0378697?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Elizabeth Webber"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,965 episodes, 1997-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0832653/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kirsten Storms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0832653?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maxie Jones"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,317 episodes, 2005-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0160637/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tyler Christopher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0160637?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nikolas Cassadine"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,134 episodes, 1996-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3212798/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chad Duell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm3212798?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Michael Corinthos"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,129 episodes, 2010-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0075788/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Julie Berman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0075788?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lulu Spencer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,077 episodes, 2005-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0123733/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Steve Burton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0123733?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jason Morgan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,162 episodes, 1991-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597450/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kelly Monaco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0597450?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sam McCall"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,004 episodes, 2003-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0334398/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nancy Lee Grahn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0334398?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alexis Davis"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,689 episodes, 1996-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005332/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ingo Rademacher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0005332?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jasper 'Jax' Jacks"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,232 episodes, 1996-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0990253/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jason Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0990253?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dr. Patrick Drake"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,133 episodes, 2005-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0952778/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dominic Zamprogna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0056758/characters/nm0952778?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dante Falconeri"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,112 episodes, 2009-2021"}]}]}

While I know that a non-linear way of film making is popular these days, it's often overused--and here it is not used effectively. Too many times, the film jumps about in time and this took me out of the experience. This makes the film too unnecessarily confusing--so I am glad that I knew the plot so I could understand what was happening. Additionally, the film used a very deliberate artsy style--such as the overuse of the color red (the tomato fight, the stack of tomato soup cans, the paint)--resulting in sledgehammer symbolism. For me, the story was very strong on its own and didn't need all these tricks.\n\nTilda Swinton stars as a mother of a child who is seriously disturbed. However, her husband (John C. Reilly) is in complete denial and inexplicably the kid is never taken to see a therapist (or exorcist). As the film progresses, the child grows from an Oppositional-Defiant child to a cold and ruthless sociopath as a teen. You never ever hear about how he is perceived by teachers and neighbors--an odd omission. However, including the child killing animals, having one of the parents in complete denial, sexually offensive behavior and the hasty behavior towards his sister are all excellent touches--which I noticed since I used to work with folks like this (which would explained why I eventually gave up being a therapist and became a teacher). Unfortunately, as the film is out of sequence, you already know that sooner or later this will all lead to Kevin committing some atrocities.\n\nOverall, this is a very compelling but frustrating film. I already talked about the film style which left me flat, but I also thought it very odd how the only one who seemed to notice anything unusual about Kevin was his mom. Even clever sociopaths are noticeable--perhaps not to everyone but to only be apparent to one person? Odd... The film is worth seeing but it just misses the mark for me--it could have been great.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi566533657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU5OTY3NzU3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0NTk5Ng@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU5OTY3NzU3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0NTk5Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The mother of a teenage boy who went on a high-school killing spree tries to deal with her grief -- and feelings of responsibility for her child's actions -- by writing to her estranged husband.", "uploadDate": "2011-11-02T09:12:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0842770/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tilda Swinton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242460/characters/nm0842770?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eva Khatchadourian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3009232/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ezra Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242460/characters/nm3009232?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin, Teenager"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3988288/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rock Duer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242460/characters/nm3988288?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kevin, Toddler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0266441/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Siobhan Fallon Hogan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242460/characters/nm0266441?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Wanda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1410939/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kenneth Franklin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242460/characters/nm1410939?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Soweto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0227894/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paul Diomede"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1242460/characters/nm0227894?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Corrections Officer Al"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3402769/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "J.

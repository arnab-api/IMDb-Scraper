Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges), this movie is a one-two knock out with entertainment around every corner. The movie stars Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, and Woody Harrelson. Colin Farrell plays a writer struggling with a screen play called \"Seven Psychopaths.\" His friend (Rockwell) is desperate to help write the screenplay. In the midst of all of this however, Rockwell also has a business on the side with Christopher Walken where they steal dogs, return them, and collect the reward money. Unfortunately, Rockwell and Walken make the mistake of stealing Woody Harrelson's dog; a psychopath who will stop at nothing to get his Shiatsu back.\n\nThis script for this film is one of the most original I've ever seen. There are a lot of twists in this movie plot-wise and genre-wise making it a fantastic, unpredictable adventure. Many would think that a movie that jumps around through different genres would be a bad thing, but this movie is so fluid and every plot point connects so well, that you aren't bothered in the slightest about deciding what the genre is of this film. A film with the title Seven Psychopaths promises intense violence and you will get that, but not just that. This is not a mindless movie that uses just blood as entertainment. This is a smart movie that has plot and meaning. Yes, it's violent but there is also drama and a surprising amount of comedy. This is without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen this year. The dialog in this film is perfect. All of the characters have a certain wit to them, delivering lines that are beyond hilarious.\n\nThe acting is superb. Christopher Walken is the best he's been in years. This could very well be one of my favorite performances from him. I liked Woody Harrelson in this movie more than I liked him in Zombie Land. I applaud Sam Rockwell for being in this movie. He is just so funny in this role and plays it perfectly. There couldn't have been a better cast for this film. Everyone was flawless.\n\nIf you enjoy creative writing, talented acting, and movies that are all-around completely original, then I encourage you to see this movie. Martin McDonagh has outdone himself and made an incredible movie. Seven Psychopaths is a must see.

No. OK? Yes!", "reviewBody": "OK, now I had no idea this movie was 'anticipated', nor did I ever see Cannibal Holocaust (although I saw fragments), so I guess this is as fair of a review as any - although I do like Eli Roth and try to see most of his work, finding some good and some bad - so I'm pretty open either way. \n\nOne of the first issues I have is seeing Richard Burgi in a minor appearance. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy since 'sentinel', But him being cast previously in Hostel (and killed), and seeing Roth has a cult following most of whom have therefore seen mr. Burgi before, is spoiling the illusion of realism. There was no reason not to use a fresh face.\n\nYou will get what you came for: cannibals, dismemberments, and flesh-eating. We also get some torture, female genitalia mutilation, and mass zombie-like behavior as well, the last of which seemed out of place and unrealistic. Some parts are silly and not in a good way, I can't tell which ones (spoiler). Some minor CGI, can't tell... (spoiler).\n\nThere are some nice 'setups' in the movie, and I applaud it for that. We aren't merely talking about a documentary, we have people with an actual agenda and some twists. Ariel Levy does a great job in being unlikeable and providing a story arc, evolving into a near psychopathic personality. \n\nThe movie got a little carried away with some methods that ruined the realism, but to each his own. To me, that's what hurt the most. The way how the movie wraps itself up makes little sense, we get some ideas thrown in that didn't really work, combine or satisfy - but that's just the last 2 minutes.\n\nIn all, a careful recommendation to the fans of the genre.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi443002905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkzMTMwOTE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI2ODkwNjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjkzMTMwOTE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI2ODkwNjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A group of student activists travels to the Amazon to save the rain forest and soon discover that they are not alone, and that no good deed goes unpunished.", "uploadDate": "2015-06-27T13:37:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4448022/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lorenza Izzo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm4448022?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Justine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0754512/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Daryl Sabara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm0754512?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lars"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1538095/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Magda Apanowicz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm1538095?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Samantha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1169229/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nicol\u00e1s Mart\u00ednez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm1169229?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Daniel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1816876/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ignacia Allamand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm1816876?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121404/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Richard Burgi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm0121404?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Charles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6435796/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Antonieta Pari"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm6435796?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "The Village Elder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2152685/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Percy Chumbe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm2152685?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Guard Leader"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1642639/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ariel Levy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm1642639?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alejandro"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1926300/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kirby Bliss Blanton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm1926300?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Amy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3650037/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sky Ferreira"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm3650037?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kaycee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2746751/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Aaron Burns"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm2746751?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jonah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1259116/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ram\u00f3n Llao"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm1259116?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "The Bald Headhunter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1918370/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mat\u00edas L\u00f3pez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm1918370?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Carlos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7657845/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tatiana Panaifo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2403021/characters/nm7657845?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Village Girl"}]}]}

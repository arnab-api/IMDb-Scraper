Then photos of Adrianne in costume were released and it made me cringe a little bit because it didn't look that great. I just couldn't see Adrianne as Wonder Woman and, after the disappointment that was Bionic Woman, the future had looked dismal for this reboot from the get-go.\n\nWhen I saw the pilot, it totally blew me away. It was well-written. It had decent character development with a lot of action and humor. It didn't try to be dark or edgy, nor did it try to be some kind of serious origin story, it was simply Wonder Woman in 2011---a charming and successful, albeit short-tempered, beautiful woman that just so happened to be a superhero. \n\nAdrianne Palicki was a real revelation for me. She made an incredibly believable Wonder Woman. I couldn't help but cheer for her because this Wonder Woman is awesome. She's beautiful, sexy, fierce, confident, self-assured, loving, noble, stubborn, impulsive, and, at the same time, a total bad ass.\n\nThe new Wonder Woman is wonderfully complicated while staying genuinely charming. I am sad that this wasn't picked up by a major network because I believe that the world would have loved this Wonder Woman. I think this is THE Wonder Woman for the new generation."}, "duration": "PT45M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0050959/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Pedro Pascal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1740828/characters/nm0050959?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ed Indelicato"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000144/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cary Elwes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1740828/characters/nm0000144?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Henry Johns"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1139632/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tracie Thoms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1740828/characters/nm1139632?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Etta Candy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001346/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Edward Herrmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1740828/characters/nm0001346?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Senator Warren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2633241/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Briana Venskus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1740828/characters/nm2633241?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Reporter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1580957/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "B.J.

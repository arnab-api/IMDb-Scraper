Caught up in the battle for primacy of science is neurotic sex-obsessed Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), who as a patient / understudy to Carl Jung develops a deep relation with her mentor, which transcends into erotic extremities. As interactions between the elder scientist Freud and his youthful prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Jung are enhanced, they finally end with a dramatic split of chosen paths, where Jung decides to foregoe any previous admiration towards his peer. Through emotional undercurrents of relations between the three characters we are introduced to tidbits of history of psychoanalysis and the differences in vision of the men who revolutionised the world. Events are strongly based on real life incidents, mostly historically accurate with only a necessary dramatic licence put in place to forward the story.\n\nThematically a very Cronenberg film and a mildly successful endeavor, which invites re-watching to fully understand the interactions between all three main characters and their undeniable, but only subtly presented, consequences. Cronenberg, always a master at getting the ugliness as well as the acting out of the most incompetent manages a rare feat: successfully proves that Keira Knightley does have some acting credentials, even if her crazed performance full of nervous ticks was at times unbearable to watch. Nothing as accomplished as the opposing forces of Mortensen and Fassbender who masterfully confronted each other both as actors as well as characters. In a tale of rivalry between concepts and ideals personal animosities do not go unnoticed with an absolutely key scene, where Jung reveals intimate dreams to Freud, who in turn reacts with contempt at Jung's readiness to be dissected, pointing out strongly that he would never lower himself to such a level.\n\n\"A Dangerous Method\" is also as emotionally sterile and disturbing as Cronenberg can be (despite having almost no brutality and little sexual content). However fitting it seems to the subject matter it can leave viewers alienated, although I myself was enthralled for the most part, put off in between, but I fully understand the feeling of being underwhelmed, as the rationale behind the story isn't focused.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3849821209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwOTEwNzQzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk5MTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwOTEwNzQzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk5MTMzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Into the already complex relationship between Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and his mentor Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) arrives a young Russian woman diagnosed with hysteria (Keira Knightley).", "uploadDate": "2011-09-03T13:05:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Keira Knightley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0461136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sabina Spielrein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1055413/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Fassbender"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm1055413?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carl Jung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0300589/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sarah Gadon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0300589?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emma Jung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0777912/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Arndt Schwering-Sohnrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0777912?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0140647/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mareike Carri\u00e8re"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0140647?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Food Nurse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0560515/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Wladimir Matuchin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0560515?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nikolai Spielrein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0856917/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Anna Thalbach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0856917?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bathtub Patient"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3531574/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bjorn Geske"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm3531574?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Orderly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001557/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Viggo Mortensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0001557?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sigmund Freud"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001993/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vincent Cassel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0001993?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Otto Gross"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0377333/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Hennicke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0377333?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Prof. Eugen Bleuler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719088/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mignon Rem\u00e9"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0719088?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jung's Secretary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2212134/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Franziska Arndt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm2212134?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bath Nurse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226312/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Dietz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm0226312?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Medical Policeman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3990011/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sarah Marecek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1571222/characters/nm3990011?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Orchard Nurse"}]}]}

As such, my movie watching is generally confined to old classic films ala TCM and AMC. But, I do subscribe to all of the premium channels via DirecTV and, occasionally, watch a newer film if the plot synopsis appears to be one that I may be able to tolerate. I have read all of the previous reviews of this film on the IMDB and find them very interesting. Many of the reviews mention a movie titled \"Seven\". I have never heard of, much less seen, \"Seven\". I consider this fact to be a fortunate one because I was able to watch \"The Bone Collector\" without having to constantly compare it to a previous film. In short, I liked this movie. I was entertained royally precisely because I didn't take the story line too seriously. There was not much time wasted on character development. GOOD !! I don't need to know why the characters became the persons that they are. I simply want them to get on with whatever they must do. Another thing that I liked was the lack of sex scenes, which seem to be almost a necessity it today's movies. The two leads did a great job and their chemistry was excellent. Mr. Washington and Ms. Jolie were very believable. The killer? No big deal. I couldn't have cared less who did the killings. I simply waited for justice to be done. In short, I don't agree with any of the harsh criticism that I have read on this forum. I guess that's because I am a rather down to earth person who has no need to turn watching a movie into an academic exercise, complete with thorough analysis of character motivation, etc.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Bone Collector", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2626617625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUwMGMyOTUtMzZhOS00MmRiLWFkNWMtNjZmNTFhNzMyMTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUwMGMyOTUtMzZhOS00MmRiLWFkNWMtNjZmNTFhNzMyMTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:32:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000243/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Denzel Washington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0145681/characters/nm0000243?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lincoln Rhyme"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001451/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Queen Latifah"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0145681/characters/nm0001451?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thelma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569458/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael McGlone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0145681/characters/nm0569458?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Detective Kenny Solomon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0650702/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Leland Orser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0145681/characters/nm0650702?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Richard Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0134072/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bobby Cannavale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0145681/characters/nm0134072?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amelia's Boyfriend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0069822/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Richard Zeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0145681/characters/nm0069822?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lt.

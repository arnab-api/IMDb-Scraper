Although, this film is the clash between two Vijay 's , there are a lot of characters who acted their roles very well. Plot-wise, the First-half plays an important part in establishing all the characters and maintains the pace while keeping the audience entertained with Jhon Dhurairaj's (Vijay)quirky and funny character and Vijay's overall outstanding screen-presence. The second half speeds up while sticking to the plot while keeping all the humour bundled within the story. The elevation for the interval was a very good addition to the film.\n\nAnirudh is a gift to the industry. His background score elevates the scenes by giving the audience twice the amount of impact for each scene. Most of the songs in this film are used in the background. Speaking of which, the songs seems to lack better placement. This does induce a little lag to the film.\n\nNow, to the main question, Is this a Lokesh Kanagaraj film?.... Yes, but partially! Even though the film has a lot of easter eggs and subtle dark humour, hints that foreshadow the upcoming events in the film, and anti-cliche elements which the director has successfully implemented... This movie seems to lack at logic at some places. Scenes have abrupt ending and audience aren't given enough time to take in the emotion in the second half,for which both the previous films of Lokesh Kanagaraj didn't have any issue.\n\nIn conclusion, this movie is a very good entertainer with a lot of fun elements(direct references as well) to wait for and a good script, with a new dimension to Vijay.

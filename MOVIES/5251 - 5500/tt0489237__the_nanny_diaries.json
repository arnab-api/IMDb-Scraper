Didn't know who was in it or what it was going to be about. To my surprise I enjoyed the well made movie very much. It had great acting, a solid story, and whiles not being original had its own unique charms that makes it a very enjoyable movie.\n\n-The movie tells the story of Annie, who is a recent graduate plucked into a world she wasn't expecting. She plans to be a financial consultant or something like that but ends being a nanny by chance. The rest of the movie follows her on her adventure as she learns what it takes to be a nanny in NY, and also learns what it takes to survive life.\n\n-The film-making technique is not necessarily an original one in which the main character narrates the whole story but what helps in this one is that its quite an entertaining narration and she doesn't narrate the whole movie so it does help. The odd visual style is also nicely done with some unique effects and one really weird scene in which we see Annie flying through New York all Mary Poppins style.\n\n-Scarlett Johansson is building quite an impressive resume with this brilliant movie. Last year she was great in \"The Prestige\" and now this year she knocks it out of the park in this. I unlike 99.7% of men don't find her hot nor do I fantasize about her, but she is a very good actress and I hope she gets more roles that showcases her acting assets like this one did. \n\nSinger turned actress Alicia Keys plays the best friend Lynette. She's not featured an awful lot in the movie, but the small doses of her are well acted.\n\nLaura Linney plays the cold and kinda misunderstood Mrs. X. Yeah she seems like z shrewd cold hearted woman when we first meet her, but after getting to know her husband Mr. X played the great Paul Giamatti, we begin to understand why she does certain things that she does. Linney has one great scene towards the end of the movie in which she realizes what horrible mother she has been and the way Linney plays that scene is truly the stuff of great acting. Instead of going all over emotional, she simply just lets a tear fall down her face and that simple tear just nails everything she's feeling at that moment. \n\nAt the end of the day I really enjoyed this fun movie. It had comedy, romance, child abuse and life lessons. It may not have great replay value but the first viewing should please everyone that watches it.\n\nRecommended", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Nanny Diaries", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1358364953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJlZjVjM2EtOTI0ZC00OThiLWFmYTUtMTJjYjI5MWJhZGUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJlZjVjM2EtOTI0ZC00OThiLWFmYTUtMTJjYjI5MWJhZGUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Weinstein Co.", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:58:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424060/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Scarlett Johansson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm0424060?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Annie Braddock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185099/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Henry Cox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm0185099?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2744941/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lewis Payton Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm2744941?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bike Messenger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1312338/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Georgina Chapman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm1312338?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "TriBeCa Fashionista"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1289995/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jodi Michelle Pynn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm1289995?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Screeching Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001473/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Laura Linney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm0001473?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. X"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0837051/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Marla Sucharetza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm0837051?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Charity Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1910870/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Allison Sarofim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm1910870?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Eating Disorder Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0614220/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Donna Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm0614220?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Judy Braddock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1006024/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alicia Keys"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm1006024?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lynette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2259988/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sonnie Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm2259988?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Human Resources Director"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1357069/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nicholas Art"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm1357069?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Grayer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0705280/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mike Rad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm0705280?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dude"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0374238/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joanna Heimbold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm0374238?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Glamour Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0427320/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Phoebe Jonas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0489237/characters/nm0427320?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Xanax Mom"}]}]}

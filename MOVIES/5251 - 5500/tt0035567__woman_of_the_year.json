As mismatched a pair if there ever were, he a down to earth sports columnist and she a world famous news reporter and commentator, fall in love. \n\nAs her celebrity is much wider known than his, Hepburn expects to have it all her own way. The rest of the film is concerned with their efforts to adjust to each other.\n\nKatharine Hepburn's character is based on liberal radio commentator and reporter Dorothy Thompson. Not surprising that no one has mentioned that yet in all the reviews so far. The giveaway is Tracy first hearing her voice on the radio while in his favorite sports bar on Information Please where Thompson was a guest. Her career petered out after World War II, so she's not known to today's audience.\n\nWriters Kanin and Lardner had as a model for the Tracy character Lardner's own father. Ring Lardner was one the celebrated sports writers of the first half of the 20th century, a great reporter and humorist. While Tracy is not as witty as Ring Lardner, he is definitely as down to earth.\n\nMy favorite scene is Spencer Tracy trying to feel comfortable at an international gathering at her place, looking even for people who speak English. Of course she's equally as uncomfortable at William Bendix's bar where Tracy likes to hang out. \n\nHepburn, comfortable in her celebrity, just sails through life, getting awards here and there. When she thinks of a Greek orphan kid she gets pressured into taking in as another award, that's when Tracy puts his foot down.\n\nBased on some real celebrities, Tracy and Hepburn become those celebrities in the flesh. It's an awesome debut for what turned out to be a great screen team.\n\nLook for fine performances by William Bendix, Fay Bainter, Minor Watson and Dan Tobin. Kanin and Lardner copped the film's only Oscar for an original screenplay. Hepburn was nominated for Best Actress, but lost to Greer Garson in Mrs. Miniver.\n\nIf Woman of the Year were remade today, the producers might consider making the woman the sports reporter. Seeing Jeannie Zelasko covering the World Series this year, I'm sure it would work very well.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000075/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Spencer Tracy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0035567/characters/nm0000075?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sam Craig"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0047810/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Fay Bainter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0035567/characters/nm0047810?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ellen Whitcomb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0914808/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Minor Watson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0035567/characters/nm0914808?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "William J.

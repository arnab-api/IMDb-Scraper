I absolutely, positively worship this brilliant woman and try to read as many of her novels, short stories and stage play adaptations as possible. \"Witness for the Prosecution\" is a genuine classic, and although somewhat atypical for Christie, it is undeniably one of the greatest stories ever penned down. There's one major disadvantage about having read all of Christie's whodunits, of course, namely that you can't experience the same astounding twist-in-the-end twice! I would really have loved to be overwhelmed by the climax of this film- version, especially because Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power give away such fabulous performances. The story, with its fascinating characters and dazzling plot twists, does remain the movie's biggest strongpoint, but there are a number of more reasons why \"Witness for the Prosecution\" is righteously considered as one of the most massive milestones in cinematic history. Billy Wilder's surefooted direction, for one, and the stellar performances of the entire ensemble cast. I mentioned Dietrich and Power already, but there's also the downright phenomenal Charles Laughton (arguably the most shamefully neglected actor/director in history) and an appealing supportive role for Elsa Lancaster. But do I daresay that the ultimate success-factor of this stage play adaptation is the masterful re-creation of the court trial? The bombastic settings and decors, the echoing acoustics, the powerful monologues of confident (and arrogant) barristers and the intimidating gowns and wigs are largely what make \"Witness for the Prosecution\" not only the first but also the mother of all courtroom dramas. This may just be the opinion of an avid fan, but practically ALL great courtroom-dramas that were released from the sixties until present day (\"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"Philadelphia\", \"Devil's Advocate\", \"A Few Good Men\"\u0085) were clearly influenced by \"Witness for the Prosecution\". In fact, I only have one minor complaint: *** Spoiler **** the film version adds one more final twist that I didn't find 100% plausible.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer [OV]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi421183001", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM2MjYzMjAtZjI5MC00YTI1LWI2MzAtMWFlNDc2OTU1MTRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM2MjYzMjAtZjI5MC00YTI1LWI2MzAtMWFlNDc2OTU1MTRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-06-30T11:11:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000061/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tyrone Power"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0000061?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Leonard Vole"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001452/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charles Laughton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0001452?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sir Wilfrid Roberts"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002369/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0002369?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brogan-Moore"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0938052/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ian Wolfe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0938052?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0889540/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Norma Varden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0889540?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mrs. Emily Jane French"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0174031/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Francis Compton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0174031?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Judge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0498181/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ruta Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0498181?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Diana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000017/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marlene Dietrich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0000017?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006471/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elsa Lanchester"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0006471?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Miss Plimsoll"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0199787/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Henry Daniell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0199787?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mayhew"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0857147/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Torin Thatcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0857147?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mr. Myers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640547/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Una O'Connor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0640547?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Janet MacKenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0867282/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Philip Tonge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051201/characters/nm0867282?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Inspector Hearne"}]}]}

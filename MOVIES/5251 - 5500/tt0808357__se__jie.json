I saw this movie yesterday and I'm still thinking about it. Tony Leung is just awesome. I had seen him in a few movies, I'd already determined that he's a great actor. I have no problem understanding what's going on with him without reading the subtitles because he communicates so much with his eyes. So watching him in this I was curious to see that something else was coming across than you'd normally expect. Here he's playing against type and I thought he did a wonderful job. Definitely Oscar worthy. As is his costar, who I kept trying to rack my brain for a film I'd seen her in but apparently she's a newbie. You'd never know it from her performance. It's a true leading performance since she carries most of the film being in just about every minute of it. She's great. And how great was it to see Josie Packard (Joan Chen) again. :) \n\nAng Lee is a genius. He's so good at capturing the emotions of his characters and actors. It's like he unfolds them so that everything on the inside is laid bare. From The Ice Storm to Brokeback Mountain to Lust, Caution he shows you real people and how they love and damage and betray each other, and more specifically how it feels. That's true talent. Anyone can point a camera. This is something else entirely.\n\nThe film itself is the best espionage film I've ever seen, but that's not all it is. It's very much like a noir and a war film and romance is probably the genre that is represented least. I've read a few reviews mentioning love and falling in it. There is some of that but I think maybe those people might want to give this one another go. They might have missed the point.\n\nWho should see this? Adults. But I'm not saying that because of the sex scenes. I'm 33. I don't know if I would have completely grasped the emotional complexity of this film 10 years ago. I think you need to have been kicked around a bit by life to fully appreciate what's happening here. Anyone who likes old movies, sad movies, good movies. Bogart fans, noir fans, costume design fans should all enjoy it. I sincerely hope it gets some recognition around Oscar time. It's my favorite this year so far.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lust, Caution", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3131769113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWVlMWEwYmEtOGQ0Zi00N2Y2LWE5YTYtYjQxMWMwZWIzYzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWVlMWEwYmEtOGQ0Zi00N2Y2LWE5YTYtYjQxMWMwZWIzYzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:21:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0504897/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tony Chiu-Wai Leung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm0504897?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mr. Yee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001040/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joan Chen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm0001040?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mrs. Yee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0849916/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tsung-Hua Tou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm0849916?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Old Wu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2428838/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ying-Hsuan Kao"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm2428838?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Huang Lei"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659300/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Johnson Yuen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm1659300?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Auyang Ling Wen"}, {"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm1659300?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Mak"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2070547/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Yan Su"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm2070547?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Ma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1258538/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ruhui Song"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm1258538?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Wang's Aunt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3604440/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jie Liu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm3604440?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Leung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2325018/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tang Wei"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm2325018?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wong Chia Chi"}, {"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm2325018?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mrs. Mak"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910966/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Leehom Wang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm0910966?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kuang Yu Min"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2356715/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Zhi-Ying Zhu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm2356715?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lai Shu Jin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461940/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lawrence Ko"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm0461940?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Liang Jun Sheng"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0157759/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kar Lok Chin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm0157759?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tsao"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372078/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Saifei He"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm0372078?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mrs. Hsiao"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910924/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hui-Ling Wang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808357/characters/nm0910924?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mrs. Liao"}]}]}

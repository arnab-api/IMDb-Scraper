I can't speak for everyone, but as for myself, I don't want to have to pay to have yet another political viewpoint shoved down my throat (CNN/Foxnews broadcasts 24/7 for that), or to be beaten over the head with with the life philosophy of some bazillionaire producer/director that lives in the Ivory Tower that is Hollywood. I can read Zarathustra, the Tao Tse Ching, or even the Bible for that.\n\nWhen I go to see a movie, I just wan to be entertained, and National Treasure BoS delivers there. Not the best movie I have ever seen, but it was an entertaining escape from reality for two hours and that it was I pay my money for. For me, the best part of the movie wasn't Nic Cage. He has done so many movies, it seems like he has gotten to the point where he is just punching the clock. He doesn't stand out on film, but he isn't horrible either and that is what we get from him here - a very pedestrian workmanlike performance. I would like to think he has another touchstone performance in him like the one he gave in \"Leaving Las Vegas\", but if he can still keep getting several million per movie just being average, why put in the effort. Diane Kruger was also pretty average. She shined in the first movie, but not so much here.\n\nFor me, John Voight, Justin Bartha and Helen Mirren were what made the movie good. John Voight was great. His character was both funny and endearing and the synergy between him and Mirren was palpable. Mirren showed once again why she is arguably the best actress in the business. Justin Bartha was a scene stealer and had some of the funniest lines (along with Voight).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. theatrical trailer: National Treasure: Book of Secrets", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi733085977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzk4Mjc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzk4Mjc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is a U.S. theatrical trailer for National Treasure: Book of Secrets, directed by Jon Turteltaub.", "uploadDate": "2007-12-14T12:28:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000115/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicolas Cage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465234/characters/nm0000115?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ben Gates"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1208167/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Diane Kruger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465234/characters/nm1208167?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Abigail Chase"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000545/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Helen Mirren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465234/characters/nm0000545?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emily Appleton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000172/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Harvey Keitel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465234/characters/nm0000172?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sadusky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0123092/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ty Burrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465234/characters/nm0123092?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Connor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1182011/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Timothy V.

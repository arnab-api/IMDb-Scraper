Real Monsters, The Ren and Stimpy Show, Rocko's Modern Life, Angry Beavers, CatDog and Invader Zim. The show is about a 10-year old boy named Timmy Turner who at first had an average life because his parents work full-time and he is stuck with the evil 16-year old babysitter, Vicky who completely tortures Timmy every time. But that all changed when he got his own fairy godparents named Cosmo and Wanda! Cosmo is my favorite character because is so funny and he isn't that smart and makes a lot of mistakes! The humor in this cartoon is hilarious and it is so clever thanks to creator Butch Hartman. Plus there has been lots of celebrities voice guest starring on the show like Chris Kirkpatrick (one of the guys from Nsync), Rick Fox (NBA Basketball player), Jay Leno (talk-show host) and some others. Another character that I think is funny is Timmy's weird and crazy teacher who wants to find out if fairies exist, Mr. Crocker! Because I think it is hilarious when he says \"FAIRY GODPARENTS\" and does these wacky stunts. This show is another classic hit and hilarious! This show premiered on Nickelodeon back in March 2001.\n\nUser Rating: 9/10\n\nBOTTOM LINE: FAIRLY FUNNY!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fairly Odd Parents", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1854669081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZWE4ODEtMTRhZC00N2Q3LTlmNWQtOWIyNTNmNzU4Y2U5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI3ZWE4ODEtMTRhZC00N2Q3LTlmNWQtOWIyNTNmNzU4Y2U5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:20:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0152839/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tara Strong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm0152839?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Timmy Turner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 2001-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0358460/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Daran Norris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm0358460?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cosmo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 2001-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0799182/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anna Silvetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm0799182?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wanda (spanish dubbing)"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 2001-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0911589/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jim Ward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm0911589?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chet Ubetcha"}, {"url": "#", "name": "85 episodes, 2001-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0048389/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dee Bradley Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm0048389?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sanjay"}, {"url": "#", "name": "65 episodes, 2001-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0086840/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Susanne Blakeslee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm0086840?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wanda"}, {"url": "#", "name": "158 episodes, 2001-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0016141/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carlos Alazraqui"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm0016141?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mr. Crocker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "131 episodes, 2001-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0217221/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Grey Griffin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm0217221?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Vicky"}, {"url": "#", "name": "107 episodes, 2001-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12372864/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sergio S\u00e1ez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0235918/characters/nm12372864?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cosmo (Spanish dubbing)"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2001-2006"}]}]}

Without trying to give away many spoilers. William (Keanu Reeves) works for a biomedical research in trying to transfer a mind of a dead person into an android. After an failed attempt. William's wife Mona (Alice Eve), his son Matt (Emjay Anthony), Sophie (Emily Alyn Lind), and Zoe (Aria Leabu) are involved an accident. William becomes a mad scientist that will do whatever it takes to save his family.\n\nThe film could have been so much more. It has an interesting concept at play such as cloning a human being and transferring their minds into the new body. Also some scary ideas of deleting memories. William becomes a mad scientist that wants to go beyond the laws of nature to save his family. He steals the lab equipment and has it set in his basement. Even his coworker/ friend Ed (Thomas Middleditch) becomes worried of Williams obsession in his research.\n\nSadly, the film does have its fault. It has questionable cgi/visual effects that looks terrible. Especially on the scene with the android coming to life. Looks like a bad Claymation. Second, the script has some laughable dialogue that seems out of place or unbelievable. The first hour of the movie is dull and boring when just watching Keanu Reeve's mad scientists behavior with his experiments. Sure, his actions does get a little messed up and may have trouble trying to find emotions to the character.\n\nKeanu Reeves did deliver an emotionless mad scientist in this film. Sure, it may work for his performance as a one dimensional type of character. Alice Eve was decent as her character. Thomas Middleditch was okay as well. And John Ortiz playing the typical corporate bad guy was forgettable.\n\nOverall, Replicas is a fair film. It has some entertaining science fiction moments with the concept after the first hour of the movie. The script and visual effects are bad. The performances are stale. This film does not rank up to being a memorable science fiction type of movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi954579481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE4NzljNmEtMGU5Zi00ZTY1LWI0ZTYtYzlkOTdiMmI2OWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE4NzljNmEtMGU5Zi00ZTY1LWI0ZTYtYzlkOTdiMmI2OWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After a car accident kills his family, a daring synthetic biologist (Reeves) will stop at nothing to bring them back, even if it means pitting himself against a government-controlled laboratory, a police task force, and the physical laws of science.", "uploadDate": "2018-11-19T20:05:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000206/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Keanu Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm0000206?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William Foster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3042755/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thomas Middleditch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm3042755?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ed Whittle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3492402/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emjay Anthony"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm3492402?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Matt Foster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6507096/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Aria Lyric Leabu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm6507096?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Zoe Foster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2429882/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amber Rivera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm2429882?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Margaret"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1579008/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Luis Gonzaga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm1579008?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Officer P\u00e9rez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6580246/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeffrey Holsman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm6580246?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Blue Eyes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0023130/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Angela Alvarado"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm0023130?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ms. Barnes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1404408/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alice Eve"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm1404408?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mona Foster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0651159/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John Ortiz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm0651159?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3014840/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Emily Alyn Lind"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm3014840?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sophie Foster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1812840/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nyasha Hatendi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm1812840?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Scott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0245398/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jonathan Dwayne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm0245398?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Security Guard #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4100551/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Andres Ramos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm4100551?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Officer Rodr\u00edguez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0517778/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sunshine Logro\u00f1o"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4154916/characters/nm0517778?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "H\u00e9ctor"}]}]}

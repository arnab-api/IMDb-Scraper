The series started off as a spy thriller with Airwolf duking it out with Russians, German terrorists, war criminals, renegade US agents and hardened mercenaries. If I remember rightly, ITV showed these episodes on Friday nights at 7pm back in November '84. \n\n When the 2nd season kicked in, they moved it to an afternoon Saturday slot. This is when a new co-pilot Caitlin was introduced. She wasn't bad, and they still did good intrigue episodes such as the gripping thriller Moffatt's Ghost, Fallen Angel and HX-1 (Once A Hero was a spectacular actioner), but gradually, the series became cornier, as the Airwolf team began helping out ordinary people and there were some soapy stories such as String falling for a rock singer. They also started using stock footage in some episodes, more so in the third season.\n\nThe 3rd season got off to a cracking start with the menacing Horn Of Plenty. Richard Lynch did a good job as the manipulative Van Horn and Caitlin proved she could be a bad*** as well. Other top episodes were Airwolf II, Annie Oakley and Deadly Circle, but as I said before, they started over-using stock footage from previous series and the stories were becoming slushy. Despite this, Airwolf was arguably the best action-packed thriller on the small screen during the Reagan era."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Airwolf: Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3893541401", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVhNGVmZmItNzRlYS00NGY2LThhYzktZTg4ZWRkZDA2NmYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVhNGVmZmItNzRlYS00NGY2LThhYzktZTg4ZWRkZDA2NmYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Series Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-01-11T17:01:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001821/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jan-Michael Vincent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086662/characters/nm0001821?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Stringfellow Hawke"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 1984-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000308/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ernest Borgnine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086662/characters/nm0000308?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dominic Santini"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 1984-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179376/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alex Cord"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086662/characters/nm0179376?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Coldsmith Briggs III"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 1984-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0779297/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jean Bruce Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086662/characters/nm0779297?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Caitlin O'Shannessy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "44 episodes, 1984-1986"}]}]}

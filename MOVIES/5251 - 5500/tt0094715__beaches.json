Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey convey the story and portray their roles to perfection. Midler also shines with her musical talent much of the time, especially with the theme song \"Wind Beneath My Wings.\" All things considered, the movie is great.\n\nMidler is Ceceila Carol \"C.C.\" Bloom, a New York aspiring entertainer with attitude and a drive to be successful in show business no matter what it takes (which she does). Hershey is Hillary Whitney, a rich kid from San Francisco with little experience beyond her posh and privileged upbringing. She and C.C. meet by chance on a beach in Atlantic City when they are 11 years old. They instantly become friends, and keep in touch with each other over 25 to 30 years through thick and thin (i.e. distance, career challenges, marriage and divorce, fights, jealousy, competition for the same man, etc). Fate and choice bring them together when they need each other most. Ultimately, their bond will be tested in a way they never imagined. How they deal with this challenge is what will determine their destiny as friends.\n\nMidler and Hershey round out the film with believable character development. They have their moments (C.C. can get on your nerves with her ego, and Hillary has her ways), but they prove that friendship weathers the most difficult of circumstances. The small supporting cast is nice as well, including Lainie Kazan as Leona Bloom (C.C.'s mother), John Heard as John Pierce, C.C.'s theater director husband, James Reed as Michael Essex, Hillary's husband, Spalding Gray as Dr. Richard Milstein who Midler takes interest in while living with Hillary in San Francisco, Mayim Bialik and Marcie Leeds as young C.C. and Hillary, and Grace Johnston as Victoria, Hillary's daughter in the latter half of the film. The \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" montage toward the end will make more than a few emotional. I highly recommend \"Beaches\" because it will make you truly appreciate and strive for the meaning of friendship and those most important to you!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1692778777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhhNzk1MzYtNDAwOC00NTdjLWJjMjEtNTA2NWM0MDdlYzM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzhhNzk1MzYtNDAwOC00NTdjLWJjMjEtNTA2NWM0MDdlYzM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-10-23T22:39:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000541/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bette Midler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0000541?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "CC Bloom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001334/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Heard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0001334?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Pierce"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0443577/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lainie Kazan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0443577?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Leona Bloom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0426648/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Grace Johnston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0426648?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Victoria Essex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0498598/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marcie Leeds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0498598?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hillary - Age 11"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0448651/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Allan Kent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0448651?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mr. Melman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0328898/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lynda Goodfriend"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0328898?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mrs. Myandowski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0294149/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael French"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0294149?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Head Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001347/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Barbara Hershey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0001347?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hillary Whitney Essex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0336960/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Spalding Gray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0336960?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Richard Milstein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416856/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "James Read"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0416856?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Essex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0080524/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mayim Bialik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0080524?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "CC (age 11)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932179/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Carol Williard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0932179?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Aunt Vesta"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0498609/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Phil Leeds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0498609?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sammy Pinkers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686614/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nikki Plant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094715/characters/nm0686614?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Iris Myandowski"}]}]}

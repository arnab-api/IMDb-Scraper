When the TV series started,Tyne Daly was back but an actress with striking blue eyes,Meg Foster was now playing Chris Cagney. Apparently there was a feeling that the two women were now too alike,now,I haven't seen any of the Meg Foster episodes for 20 years,so can't really remember them but always felt Foster got a bit of a raw deal,when she was axed after just six episodes. Anyway,the series came with a catchy new theme tune and Sharon Gless now as Chris Cagney,who funnily enough,was always the production team's first choice for Cagney and the matching of Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless was excellent and according to Miss Gless the secret of playing Cagney was \"talking tough and wearing pink!\" The writing and acting was always first rate,one of my favourite episodes was \"Burn Out\" when Lacey,all set for a much needed vacation has her leave cancelled at the last minute and goes AWOL and ends up on a beach and after spending time with a woman of a similar age,who has drifted all her life,Lacey realises although she sometimes has to juggle so many things,she loves her life. Cagney and Lacey were not best friends,they could argue very forcibly,like the time when a member of the public was shot by accident,Cagney said he had a gun,Lacey didn't see it,leading to Cagney saying Lacey was just a cop for the money,not like her for a career,she later had to apologise for that one. I hope this entire series comes out on DVD soon,including the Meg Foster episodes too,I highly recommend it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Cagney & Lacey: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3187916057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzU4YThmZDktZDNkZi00ZTUyLWE5MWYtZDg3ZGE0NjNkOTU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzU4YThmZDktZDNkZi00ZTUyLWE5MWYtZDg3ZGE0NjNkOTU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Cagney & Lacey: Season 1", "uploadDate": "2019-04-12T04:25:01Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002033/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tyne Daly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083395/characters/nm0002033?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mary Beth Lacey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "126 episodes, 1981-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0184392/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Martin Kove"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083395/characters/nm0184392?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Victor Isbecki"}, {"url": "#", "name": "125 episodes, 1982-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167368/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sidney Clute"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083395/characters/nm0167368?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Detective Paul La Guardia"}, {"url": "#", "name": "124 episodes, 1982-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0525855/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carl Lumbly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083395/characters/nm0525855?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mark Petrie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "107 episodes, 1981-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0805331/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Troy W.

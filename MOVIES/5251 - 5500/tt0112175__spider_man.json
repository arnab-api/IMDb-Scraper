Growing up as a small kid watching it everyday when coming home from school i quickly became a huge fan of the series and Spider-Man himself, if i hadn't had seen this series i would probably never had been a Spider-Man fan. Every episode was amazing they always had a great cliff hanger, great story, great characters, great voice actors and great animation. The Venom Saga was easily my favorite storyline i remember watching all the time on VHS after receiving it as a Christmas present, the storyline was amazing, i didn't read the Spider-Man comics to know the origin of the Symbiote but this TV Show told it better as far as staying in Spider-Mans world.The Storyline was very dark and scary if only the Spider-Man 3 film had followed the symbiote story it would have made more sense and been better but the storyline was pure incredible, Peters dark side was unique and scary. Venom quickly became one of my favorite villain to ever step into the Superhero world. The series didn't have the character of Gwen Stacy but i was totally fine by, i didn't discover her character until years later. The Green Goblin was always my second favorite character of the show his design was perfect and his character was perfect as well and he delivered one of the most amazing evil laughs i have ever heard. The series didn't feature much Electro so that disappointed me because he is my favorite villain ever believe it or not. I always enjoyed The Black Cat and Spider-Man episodes mainly because i enjoyed the love relationship storyline a ton, i enjoyed it more then the Peter and MJ story lines likely because Black Cat was like Spider-Man a lot fighting crime. If you are now in your teens and are a die hard Spider-Man fan it is likely because you grew up watching this series, like myself. This series is very special to me and it will always remain my favorite cartoon series ever. 10/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "DVD Trailer - The Venom Saga", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1030274585", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdmZTM4OTQtM2UwYS00NjJjLWEyODItOWU3OGYyODQzNWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdmZTM4OTQtM2UwYS00NjJjLWEyODItOWU3OGYyODQzNWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A young man with spider-like abilities fights crime as a superhero in New York City while trying to have a normal personal life.", "uploadDate": "2020-08-03T13:13:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0055549/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Christopher Daniel Barnes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112175/characters/nm0055549?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Parker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "65 episodes, 1994-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000799/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edward Asner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112175/characters/nm0000799?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "J.

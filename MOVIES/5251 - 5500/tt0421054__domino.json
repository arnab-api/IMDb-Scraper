I dare you to not laugh once she starts introducing terms such as Blacktino, Chinegro, and Japanic. I suppose if you suck at the teat of political correctness then you might not get the joke, but otherwise it's one of the funnier scenes in the movie (the running 90210 joke being the funniest). At this point you're probably wondering what in the world Mo'Nique, Jerry Springer, mixed flow charts, and 90210 have to do with a movie about bounty hunters. It's a legit question. All I can say is welcome to the unconventionalism that is Domino.\n\nI didn't mind the fact that this isn't very conventional, but at times it does feel a little convoluted. By the end of the movie I was pretty clear regarding what was going on, unlike the 'tard in front of me who couldn't decipher the concept of flashbacks, but the script does feel unnecessarily complex. Yeah, the movie kept my interest and is fairly entertaining, but it was just begging for tighter editing. Trimming about 20 minutes would've made the story stronger and the narrative more fluent. My guess is that Scott was experimenting and just couldn't bear to get rid of anything (Tom Waits' cameo especially felt unnecessary).\n\nTony Scott's made a movie that appears to be something he and his friends could most enjoy while under the influence of substances of a dubious nature. I can deal with the frantic pacing, the quick camera cuts, and the strange coloring, but is it really necessary to show characters saying the same line multiple times from different angles? Sometimes it's all just a little too weird for the sake of being weird.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints is that we mainly know that Domino is a bounty hunter because she tells us about 24 times in her narration, which starts to grate on the nerves after a while. I would've preferred to see a little more focus on, you know, her actual bounty hunting. SHOW us why she was a really good bounty hunter; don't just tell us over and over. I was expecting some really cool scenes with Mickey Rourke and Keira hunting down their bounty, showcasing the technical side of the hunt, and wrapping it all up with cool, tough-guy (and girl) bounty hunter stuff. Maybe a little sniping here, a vicious beat down there. Sadly, it never came.\n\nDo I remind everybody that I'm a reviewer by pointing out in every single review that, \"I'm Johnny Betts. I'm a movie reviewer\"? No, I do my job and show you what it is that makes me a movie reviewer! \n\n\"By writing crappy reviews, Johnny?\" \n\nUh, well, I guess we all get mixed reactions sometimes.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT2H7M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Domino", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi61014297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODlhZTBhNzgtNTZlNC00OGI2LWI2YmItMzk2M2JhNzc5NWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODlhZTBhNzgtNTZlNC00OGI2LWI2YmItMzk2M2JhNzc5NWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from New Line Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:54:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Keira Knightley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0461136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Domino Harvey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1183149/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edgar Ram\u00edrez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm1183149?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Choco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0594898/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mo'Nique"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0594898?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lateesha Rodriguez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004975/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Macy Gray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0004975?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lashandra Davis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001056/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dabney Coleman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0001056?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Drake Bishop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005575/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ian Ziering"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0005575?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ian Ziering"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0414772/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Peter Jacobson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0414772?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Burke Beckett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642221/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kel O'Neill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0642221?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Frances"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000620/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mickey Rourke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0000620?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ed Moseby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005148/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Delroy Lindo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0005148?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Claremont Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002546/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mena Suvari"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0002546?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kimmie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000302/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jacqueline Bisset"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0000302?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sophie Wynn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004977/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Brian Austin Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0004977?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Brian Austin Green"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0112070/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Stanley Kamel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0421054/characters/nm0112070?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Anthony Cigliutti"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141953/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "T.K.

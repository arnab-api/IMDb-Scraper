Gary Cooper is his usual tall in the saddle hero whose presence brings about a general righting of wrongs.\n\nExcept that Mr. Goldwyn had the presence of mind to cast Walter Brennan as Judge Roy Bean, local head honcho of the area around Vinegarroon, Texas. With William Wyler directing Brennan etches an unforgettable film portrayal of a man who's both ruthless in enforcing his will on the territory and a likable sort of cuss once you get to know him.\n\nBrennan has one weakness, as the legends have it in the west, he's crushing out big time of famed English actress Lily Langtry. When Gary Cooper is brought into Brennan's courtroom which in off hours is also a saloon, a little quick thinking on his part upon seeing Langtry's portrait over the bar saves his life. \n\nDespite Cooper's friendship with the judge, he's also taken an interest in homesteader Fred Stone's daughter, Doris Davenport. It's inevitable that Cooper and Brennan come to a parting of the ways.\n\nWyler who is not a director of westerns per se has directed a couple of good ones and this is one of them. There are some good action scenes here, there are some scenes laced with humor when Brennan is around, and the romance is nicely handled.\n\nDana Andrews and Forrest Tucker got their first notice in The Westerner as well in small parts. But it's Brennan's show.\n\nWalter Brennan won his third Best Supporting Actor Oscar with this film. This was the fifth year the Supporting Player categories were being awarded by the Academy and Brennan won numbers one and three previously.\n\nWestern fans will like The Westerner in any event and others will watch it to see a master craftsman in Walter Brennan at his job.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000011/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gary Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0000011?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cole Harden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0202589/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Doris Davenport"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0202589?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jane Ellen Mathews"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0875861/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Forrest Tucker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0875861?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wade Harper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932629/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chill Wills"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0932629?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Southeast"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000763/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dana Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0000763?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hod Johnson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0054253/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Trevor Bardette"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0054253?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Shad Wilkins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0514707/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lucien Littlefield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0514707?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "The Stranger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000974/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Walter Brennan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0000974?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Judge Roy Bean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0831872/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Fred Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0831872?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Caliphet Mathews"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0403636/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paul Hurst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0403636?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chickenfoot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0093988/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lilian Bond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0093988?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lily Langtry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0357111/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Charles Halton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0357111?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mort Borrow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0878927/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tom Tyler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033253/characters/nm0878927?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "King Evans"}]}]}

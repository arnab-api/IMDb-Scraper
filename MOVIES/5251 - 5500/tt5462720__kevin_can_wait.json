With his partial pension he and Wife Donna, played by Erinn Hayes, work through season one deciding how they'll make up some income by renting out their garage as an apartment (Common on Long Island). The chemistry was being built by wife Donna redirecting Kevin's mistakes along the way. The family was deadpan except for \"Chale\" the eldest daughters nerdy boyfriend in Country via a Visa and the retired friends were something that could of and should of been built upon. Chale fast became a season one bright spot as the chemistry between him and Kevin was wrought with tension and humor. THIS was something the audience expected would grow in Season Two, However show runner Rob decided the ratings were not up to par. The Ratings took a nose dive in season two as Donna was mysteriously killed off without explanation in the season two opener. Leah Remini was brought in to recreate the King Of Queens TV show, much to the viewers despair. The show needed to build on season one's characters of friends and family but has instead focused on Remini and James opening a P.I. agency. In short, the fun was taken out of the show, something even the canned laughter can't save as the ratings are showing. They left no room to bring back Kevin's wife Donna (Erinn Hayes) and the show is trapped in a corner. The friends and family are now all but forgotten as they were dropped from focus as a point of tension and laughter. Kevin James is likable and Leah Remini's old shtick doesn't work here. I don't see an out for this show to rebound and reconnect with the audience which is a shame. I liked season one but season two might just be it's downfall. It was a family show you could watch with your children (who know and love Kevin James) but that has been removed from the show in favor of the downtrodden banter James and Remini had in King Of Queens. If you want that, watch those re-runs, their still on.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Kevin Can Wait--First Look", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi371767065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDA4MTA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwMDA4MTA0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "First look at Kevin Can Wait", "uploadDate": "2016-07-20T07:24:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416673/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm0416673?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Gable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0142206/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ryan Cartwright"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm0142206?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chale Witt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1120315/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Leonard Earl Howze"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm1120315?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tyrone 'Goody' Goodman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2325460/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary-Charles Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm2325460?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sara Gable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141613/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Erinn Hayes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm0141613?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Donna Gable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4416257/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Christopher Brian Roach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm4416257?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mott"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1837588/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Taylor Spreitler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm1837588?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kendra Gable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0884230/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gary Valentine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm0884230?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kyle Gable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6048343/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "James DiGiacomo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm6048343?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jack Gable"}, {"url": "#", "name": "48 episodes, 2016-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0718957/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Leah Remini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm0718957?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Vanessa Cellucci"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2017-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0893120/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lenny Venito"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5462720/characters/nm0893120?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Duffy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2016-2017"}]}]}

Take two crazy special effects guys and let them take the urban myths to the ultimate test. In each episode Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage test different myths to see if their actually true or just made up.\n\nThe two hosts are just perfect. They do a great job in making the whole thing crazy and funny. You feel like you get to know them. That is a good thing as it then gets more personal. The show is well directed and well written. The cinematography I think is cool. You see booms and cameras in the picture all the time, but that gives credibility to the show. It gives the impression that they're focusing at documenting the experiments and not on the look of the show. I like that kind of \"rough\" and incidental look of the show. When I say it's well written I mean well written. It's not coincidence where they go to get the stuff they need and so on, but they made it seem like it is. It's things like this that gives this show a nice down to earth feel. The fact that the two host obviously have a lot of fun when putting the myths to the test also reflect on the show and it makes you interested and makes you pay attention. If you start watching time flies. They also does a good job in letting us know what the experts think of the myth. This makes it all the more interesting as they will have to prove them wrong or right too.\n\nMythbusters is a show I can recommend. It's funny, it's intelligent and it's educational. It's science made cool."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mythbusters: Collection 9", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi930129433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWY1ZTVjMjQtZDBlNi00ODRhLThlNGUtMGU3YTVmY2QyMTQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWY1ZTVjMjQtZDBlNi00ODRhLThlNGUtMGU3YTVmY2QyMTQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Mythbusters: Collection 9", "uploadDate": "2013-05-23T04:21:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1564951/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383126/characters/nm1564951?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Narrator"}, {"url": "#", "name": "294 episodes, 2003-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0767234/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Adam Savage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383126/characters/nm0767234?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "284 episodes, 2003-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1125271/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tory Belleci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383126/characters/nm1125271?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "241 episodes, 2004-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1367178/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jamie Hyneman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383126/characters/nm1367178?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "284 episodes, 2003-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1671108/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kari Byron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383126/characters/nm1671108?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "241 episodes, 2003-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0408017/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Grant Imahara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383126/characters/nm0408017?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "216 episodes, 2005-2018"}]}]}

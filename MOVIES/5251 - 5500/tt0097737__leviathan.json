Cosmatos and then screenplay is written by David Webb Peoples & Jeb Stuart from Peoples' own story. It stars Peter Weller, Richard Crenna, Amanda Pays, Daniel Stern, Ernie Hudson, Michael Carmine, Lisa Eilbacher, Hector Elizondo & Meg Foster.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the rating I have given is purely for personal reasons, I love daft creature features and rate them accordingly. Artistically the film scores about the average mark of 5/10, the acting, story and effects really don't demand much better unless you have got a soft spot for the genre. Tagged as Alien underwater, the film was always going to struggle to live up to that particular tag for sure, but yes, in structure that is what we get. A group of deep-sea miners come across a wrecked soviet ship and after plundering what they can they end up with more than they bargained for. Enter the plot of deep-sea miners under attack from a very bad and creepy monster. Will they survive? How did it happen? And on it goes to a joyously (unintentionally) funny finale. The film crams as many creature feature clich\u00e9s in as it can get away with, and sure enough the boo jump scare moments are not in short supply.\n\nThe cast are all in on the joke (I'm pretty sure they are), so all in all you get a flipping great genre entry that isn't demanding much of the viewer, that is if you are so inclined to check the brain at the door first. So enjoy a B lister that has no pretensions other than to homage and entertain those of a certain persuasion. Quite a cast of pro actors assembled as well. 7/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000693/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Weller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0000693?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steven Beck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005301/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amanda Pays"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0005301?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elizabeth 'Willie' Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001368/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ernie Hudson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0001368?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Justin Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002060/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lisa Eilbacher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0002060?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bridget Bowman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001236/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Meg Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0001236?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ms. Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0231001/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Larry Dolgin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0231001?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Helicopter Pilot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0671284/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Steve Pelot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0671284?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Winch Operator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001077/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Richard Crenna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0001077?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Glen 'Doc' Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0827663/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Daniel Stern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0827663?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Buzz 'Sixpack' Parrish"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0138483/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Carmine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0138483?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tony 'DeJesus' Rodero"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001185/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hector Elizondo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097737/characters/nm0001185?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "G.

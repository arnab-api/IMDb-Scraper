I'd go so far as to say it's safe as to say it's the best Arnie led movie since his return for politics. It's certainly his best performance. It's a performance lots of people doubted he had in him. I love the big guy, but I've often thought he never really had any acting talent, and he got by on his charisma and surrounding himself with top talented directors. I think it says something that I thought his best performance was in Terminator 2, as a non human. Here he absolutely knocks it out of the park, he is superb and utterly heartbreaking! Scott McNairy is equally as good as The air traffic controller Jake Baonos. He certainly is not the villain of the peace. There was only one bad guy in the movie as far as I'm concerned and he was a smarmy lawyer played by to arrogant perfection by Kevin Zegers without an ounce of empathy in him.\n\nIf I have once complaint, it's about the movies ending, which I one ruin here. All in all a compelling, well acted, well made movie. Give me thanks like this over yet another Fast & Furious or Transformers movie any day!! I hope this leads to more dramatic work for Arnie, as he shows here he has it in his locker to surprise people. I hope they take notice.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Aftermath", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi364886297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMzMWFmNGQtMTlhNi00MThmLWEzMjYtMGQ4MmFhNjkyZWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMzMWFmNGQtMTlhNi00MThmLWEzMjYtMGQ4MmFhNjkyZWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Aftermath", "uploadDate": "2017-04-19T07:02:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000216/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm0000216?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1192254/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Maggie Grace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm1192254?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0837942/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Larry Sullivan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm0837942?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "James Gullick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0607703/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Glenn Morshower"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm0607703?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Matt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0233027/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Martin Donovan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm0233027?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Robert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0201178/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Christopher Darga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm0201178?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Andrew"}, {"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm0201178?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Corpulent Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5709317/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dani Sherrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm5709317?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nadiya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2682807/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Aaron Crutchfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm2682807?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Technician"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1058940/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Scoot McNairy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm1058940?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jake"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4990625/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Judah Nelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm4990625?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Samuel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1478613/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jason McCune"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm1478613?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Thomas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1674570/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mariana Klaveno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm1674570?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3799669/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hannah Ware"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm3799669?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tessa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2301775/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Teri Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm2301775?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Airline Supervisor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4233953/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jeff Panzarella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4581576/characters/nm4233953?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Airport Employee"}]}]}

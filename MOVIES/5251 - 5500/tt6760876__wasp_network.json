Pity.", "reviewBody": "Given the intriguing story and really good cast behind this, it ought to have been good. It isn't. It meanders all over the place with way too many plots, sub plots and storylines all ambling about devoid of a solid narrative. It could be a six-parter if it wanted to be, but as a single film it just doesn't really gel at all. Olivier Assayas clearly has some skin in the game as he sets out to interweave the political and personal stories of 5 Cubans who end up, by various means, in Florida in the 1990s. Tourist pilot Edgar Ramirez (\"Rene\") is one of then, who leaves home and stunningly gorgeous wife Penelope Cruz (\"Olga\") one day, pinches a plane and defects to the US where, together with \"Juan Pablo\" (Wagner Moura) he is soon part of a network that effectively tries to assist Cuban defectors to get to the USA. Their determination to destabilise the Castro administration starts to lead them into more complex, moral choices whilst we continue to see his wife struggling with day to day life back home with their daughter. That's just the first half hour... There are plenty more characters, and storylines; CIA involvement; the infamous hotel bombs of 1997 - all told in a rigidly episodic fashion. It is trying to cram way too much into two hours and as such the characterisations suffer. It's not that you don't like or sympathise with them, it's that you don't ever feel you really know or understand them - Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal as the equivalent of \"Control\" somehow lacks any menace or sophistication too. There is some beautiful photography of the island of Cuba itself, and of the Canary Islands, and it looks great, the cast look great, but it needed much more focus and much tighter plot filtration.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT2H7M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1948368409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkNzY0MGEtMmJjZC00Yzc2LTg5ZDAtMTc2OGUxNjAyZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkNzY0MGEtMmJjZC00Yzc2LTg5ZDAtMTc2OGUxNjAyZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Based on a true and gripping story: Cuban spies infiltrate exile groups in the 1990s to stop terrorism against the island, but at a high personal cost.

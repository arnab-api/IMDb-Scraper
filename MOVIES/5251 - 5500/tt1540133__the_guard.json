Its beautiful simplicity, provoking colors and incredibly witty lines simply make this a small masterpiece. I haven't expected a thing, but it does seem that this directorial surname becomes something to be kept close within the radar.\n\nIt has somewhat of that Warhal-like touch to it within the play of multiple strong colors and nuances, where it is visually provoking and satisfying, easy to relate and almost as easy to touch. Along with remarkable scenery and those absolutely sets details, the roles are accordingly brilliant. \n\nBrendan is more than expectedly good and from my point of view, this might just be his best role so far (though all are excellent). The easiness and the flow make the movie a cake one swallows easily. Though grim at all times, it puts a big smile on a face from the first moment. \n\nUnpretentious and fresh, it has a tiny nuance of early '90 movies such as \"Pulp Fiction\", but unlike others, the directing made it look absolutely different. It is unpredictable at all times, yet one keeps waiting for Gleeson's next line. Probably one of my favorites for some time. Will watch again, definitely.\n\nAs for the language, I have to agree with the issue - English is not my native language but it was so awful trying to watch it with those unnatural subs in English. It took half of the fun and I simply turned it off and enjoyed it, understanding it easily. Being so lost in translation, it certainly will not be as great as it really is - even one line lost is too much for such a screenplay.\n\nI'm not an Irish, right. Yet I could identify easily with the characters and feel the ease. As for this year's movies I've seen so far, this was the biggest surprise and biggest satisfaction.\n\nWith simple soundtrack which turns out fully unexpected towards the very end - much of a \"Mexican standout\", \"The Guard\" is truly a rewarding movie and a hope that there are still ways to make fresh ones to enjoy without having to compare or predict.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Guard - International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3330710553", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4MjI4OTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE5MTc3NQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY4MjI4OTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE5MTc3NQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An unorthodox Irish policeman with a confrontational personality is teamed up with an uptight FBI agent to investigate an international drug-smuggling ring.", "uploadDate": "2011-06-29T19:58:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2426101/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ronan Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm2426101?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Young Man in Car"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4961338/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Patrick Beirne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm4961338?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Young Man in Car"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4961122/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Christopher Kilmartin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm4961122?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Young Man in Car"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0444676/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rory Keenan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm0444676?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Aidan McBride"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0455663/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Laurence Kinlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm0455663?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Photographer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0192377/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Liam Cunningham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm0192377?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Francis Sheehy-Skeffington"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001217/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fionnula Flanagan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm0001217?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Eileen Boyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000332/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Don Cheadle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm0000332?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "FBI Agent Wendell Everett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4961072/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Paraic Nialand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm4961072?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Young Man in Car"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4961279/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Liam O'Conghaile"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm4961279?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Young Man in Car"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0322407/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brendan Gleeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm0322407?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Gerry Boyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4961455/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Declan Mannlen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm4961455?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James McCormick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4335120/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Michael Og Lane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm4335120?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Eugene Moloney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0789261/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Owen Sharpe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm0789261?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Billy Devaney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0645358/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Wale Ojo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1540133/characters/nm0645358?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Doctor Oleyuwo"}]}]}

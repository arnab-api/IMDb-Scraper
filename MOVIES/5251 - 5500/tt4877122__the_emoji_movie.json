Now, this is by far the most unoriginal movie ever - it's general plot, themes, and stuff are all stuff that we've seen time and time again. It has some of the cheesiest lines in history (with Aquaman coming in a close second). It is also extremely predictable. But it has a talented cast who's voices are just perfect for their roles, great animation, and you know what? It doesn't hurt to hear the message that this movie showcases once again as it is actually relevant. And while it is predictable it also is entertaining enough to keep you interested. Though, if you don't like the plot, give it a shot for the music. The music in it is fantastic, even if you don't like the plot. It's meant to be a funny, feel-good, charming movie greatly succeeds in that regard. Give it a shot, though I can't guarantee whether or not you'd like it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H26M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2882779417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YyY2E4ZDctMDg1MC00NTA2LWE3MGUtZjAzMTJhOGRlMzA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YyY2E4ZDctMDg1MC00NTA2LWE3MGUtZjAzMTJhOGRlMzA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Emoji Movie unlocks the never-before-seen secret world inside your smartphone. Hidden within the messaging app is Textopolis, a bustling city where all your favorite emojis live, hoping to be selected by the phone's user.

Determined to become \"normal\" like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his handy best friend Hi-5 and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak. Together, they embark on an epic \"app-venture\" through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene.

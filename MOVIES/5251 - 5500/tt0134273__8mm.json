Also it stars two other terrific actors like Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, so usually that equals a great film. 8 MM turned out to be a terrific dark drama that I'm not so sure that I understand it's low rating. I was actually expecting it to be in the 7.0 range when I went to check it out on IMDb, but it's in the low 6.0's. I understand that it's an extremely dark movie that not too many people would wanna take a look at, but for what it was, I thought it was great. It took us into the deep dark world of porn and what some sick people get off on. It's not just about that, but also it takes us into a detective type of drama that makes it into a scary type of thriller.\n\nTom Welles is a detective that is given a strange short movie called a \"snuff film\", where a beautiful young girl is being brutally raped and then murdered on film. While it's supposed to be fake, it looks incredibly real and terrifying. Her relative asks him to find out wither it is fake or real and if she's still alive. This means he has to go deep into a world of brutal porn that is out of his league. With the help of a porn salesman, Max, they go to find out if this girl is really alive or not, but end up getting into some serious trouble when the directors and \"actors\" find out about them.\n\n8 MM is in no way for the faint of heart, there are some extremely disturbing images that I really wouldn't like to see again, I'm sure most wouldn't either, but this is a great dark drama that I would recommend for a watch. Nicholas did a great job, but Joaquin really takes the show here. He made his character incredibly believable and almost sympathetic. Joel really made me believe the story, he shot it wonderfully and didn't over do anything. I would recommend this film for a watch, it's a great thriller that is impressive as well as scary.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "8mm", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4078878489", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZhMDc0Y2YtYTgxMi00MGRkLWEwNGMtYWE2ZGQzM2RjNDViXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZhMDc0Y2YtYTgxMi00MGRkLWEwNGMtYWE2ZGQzM2RjNDViXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Home Video Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-12-18T17:06:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000115/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicolas Cage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0000115?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Welles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001254/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Gandolfini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0001254?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eddie Poole"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372217/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anthony Heald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0372217?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Longdale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001416/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Catherine Keener"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0001416?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Amy Welles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0607920/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amy Morton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0607920?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Janet Mathews"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0125988/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Anne Gee Byrd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0125988?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Senator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0650406/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Luis Oropeza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0650406?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Archive Director"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0187199/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Don Creech"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0187199?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mr. Anderson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001618/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joaquin Phoenix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0001618?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Max California"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001780/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Peter Stormare"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0001780?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dino Velvet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0061777/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chris Bauer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0061777?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Machine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141839/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Myra Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0141839?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mrs. Christian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0694158/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jenny Powell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0694158?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mary Ann Mathews"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0079439/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jack Betts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0079439?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Butler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0802019/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rachel Singer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134273/characters/nm0802019?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Neighbor"}]}]}

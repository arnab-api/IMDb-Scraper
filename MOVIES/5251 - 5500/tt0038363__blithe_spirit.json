The play completed 3 decades as Britain's longest run in West End for a comedic play. The film which was adapted from the play was directed by David Lean and incorporated some of the most sophisticated special effects yet seen in a movie. The film tackles some dark themes such as death and falling in and out of love. The characters themselves are on the face of it unsympathetic. Elvira is a siren, Ruth is shrewish and Charles a misogynist. Despite this the film works well as a comedy because of the quick and clever dialogue between the characters and the scene stealing performances of Margaret Rutherford's Madame Arcarti. You end laughing at and sometimes with the characters as one would do a Shakespeare comedy. Never has a film about death been so funny", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Blithe Spirit", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi90881817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdkZjQwMTYtOGM0Yi00Yjc1LTg4ZTUtNjY3MGVhYzI0MzIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdkZjQwMTYtOGM0Yi00Yjc1LTg4ZTUtNjY3MGVhYzI0MzIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-01-24T17:02:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001322/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rex Harrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038363/characters/nm0001322?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charles Condomine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0358723/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kay Hammond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038363/characters/nm0358723?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elvira Condomine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0906775/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hugh Wakefield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038363/characters/nm0906775?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. George Bradman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164801/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jacqueline Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038363/characters/nm0164801?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Edith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0191870/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Constance Cummings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038363/characters/nm0191870?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ruth Condomine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0751983/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Margaret Rutherford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038363/characters/nm0751983?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Madame Arcati"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0136983/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joyce Carey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038363/characters/nm0136983?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Violet Bradman"}]}]}

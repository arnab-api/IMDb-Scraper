Often (wrongly) compared to Serling's other series, \"The Twilight Zone\"...the overall mood, and purpose of this series is different. The \"Zone\" was a collection of morality tales, disguised as sci-fi stories. A fantastic show, without a doubt, but the \"Gallery\" was designed purely to shock and entertain...and it certainly succeeded in that area.\n\nSo much great talent was on display in this series. The actors, writers, directors, and musicians were almost always top-notch. Though the decision to have multiple stories within each episode, did result in some mediocre results sometimes (especially with the campy vignettes), the quality of the better segments is what most remember best.\n\nAmong some of the better segments: \n\n\"They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar\", with William Windom (in an awesome performance) as a has-been salesman who's beckoned by the ghosts of his past.\n\n\"The Doll\", about a gruesome doll, sent to a British officer as revenge.\n\n\"The Tune in Dan's Cafe\", about a haunted jukebox that plays the same song always.\n\n\"Green Fingers\", with Elsa Lanchester as an elderly woman, harassed by a tycoon who wants her land, where she has an unusual knack for gardening.\n\nSo many more great ones. Some folks get turned off by the dated 1970s look to this show (the costumes, sets, bright color, excessive use of zooms/close-ups). If you can get past that aspect, and rather appreciate the show's camp value, you're sure to enjoy this unique and highly original horror series. It's a classic in my book."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1660337689", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTMzNmNmNzMtMDFlYS00MmIxLTllY2MtMzA5YWZkODA1MWQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTMzNmNmNzMtMDFlYS00MmIxLTllY2MtMzA5YWZkODA1MWQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-04-14T09:46:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785245/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rod Serling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0065327/characters/nm0785245?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 1969-1973"}]}]}

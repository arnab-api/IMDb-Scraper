Testosterone powered mayhem.", "reviewBody": "The Last Boy Scout is without a doubt one of the greatest action movies ever made. There is nothing a good action film needs that isn't woven into Tony Scott's vision of Shane Black's screenplay. We have shootouts.... lots and lots of shootouts. We have Bruce Willis. We have football. We have some beautiful women at our disposal. There are some fast cars. There are drugs. And the profanity-laden dialog is so well-written that virtually the entire script can be read in the memorable quotes section of this site.\n\nOur story, though completely preposterous, has some real depth. We have multi-dimensional characters and we are taken on quite a ride with them as the action unfolds. Bruce Willis plays a burned out private investigator who helps a disgraced former pro football player solve the murder of his girlfriend. Before our story ends, we have a dirty US senator, a greedy football team owner, and about a hundred seedy henchmen thrown into the mix. Things move so quickly that only towards the end does one of our characters actually speak a line that sums up how ridiculous it all is. Damon Wayans, who plays the former football star gives Willis some sobering insight. He points out that Willis must be one of the dumbest people alive. He is not only trying to save the life of the man who ruined his career, but also trying to avenge the death of the man who was f*#king his wife! But somehow, we the audience care about the outcome, and getting there couldn't be more fun.\n\nThe film has dated fairly well up to this point. Being as though it came out in 1991, you can still see a high top fade on a black character or two. The football uniforms have changed a little, too, but these are minor things that take nothing away from the enjoyment of the story. Water is still wet, the sky is still blue, and this is still one hell of a movie...and then some!!! This film scores a perfect 10 of 10 stars. It couldn't have been made any better.\n\nSo sayeth the Hound.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Last Boy Scout", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2475622681", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRmZjJmMTYtNTgzNy00NzRhLThhY2UtYTFlYzZmNjY0ODI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRmZjJmMTYtNTgzNy00NzRhLThhY2UtYTFlYzZmNjY0ODI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:32:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0000246?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Joe Hallenbeck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001210/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chelsea Field"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0001210?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sarah Hallenbeck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0624510/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Taylor Negron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0624510?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Milo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000932/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Halle Berry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0000932?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cory"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0229200/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Badja Djola"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0229200?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alley Thug"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0743304/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chelcie Ross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0743304?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Senator Baynard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0270948/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Clarence Felder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0270948?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "McCaskey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0172806/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Frank Collison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0172806?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Pablo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001834/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Damon Wayans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0001834?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jimmy Dix"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932244/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Noble Willingham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0932244?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sheldon Marcone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364583/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Danielle Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0364583?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Darian Hallenbeck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569226/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bruce McGill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0569226?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mike Matthews"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167649/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kim Coates"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0167649?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0764134/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joe Santos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0764134?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bessalo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519440/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tony Longo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102266/characters/nm0519440?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Big Ray Walton"}]}]}

Abundant voice-overs usually point toward shortcomings in a drama, but here they provide irony and serve to enhance the dialog. \n\nIn her juiciest role since \"Mrs Brown,\" Judi Dench brings an element of sympathy to Barbara, a closeted, self-loathing lesbian school teacher attracted to the new art teacher, Sheba, played by Cate Blanchett. Madly hoping to wrest the heterosexual Sheba from her husband and two children, one of whom has Down Syndrome, Barbara stumbles upon Sheba's sexual dalliance with a 15-year-old student. In a Machiavellian turn, Barbara hopes to manipulate Sheba by maintaining her secret . . . with strings attached. Need I add that all does not go well?\n\nIn fact, escalating histrionic fireworks ensue. Blanchett holds her own in this emotional and physical battle royal, capping her incredible year (2006) that also included outstanding performances in \"Babel\" and \"The Good German.\" As Sheba's husband, Richard, Bill Nighy also comes through with a powerhouse performance. The moody score by Philip Glass is icing on the cake.\n\nAt a tidy 92 minutes, \"Notes on a Scandal\" is highly concentrated and vivid. The recently announced Golden Globe nominations include Dench, Blanchett and Marber, so we can expect Oscar nods as well.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Notes on a Scandal", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1419641113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjYzY3NzItYWRlMS00MTYyLWE4NGQtN2YwNzJiNTBlZjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjYzY3NzItYWRlMS00MTYyLWE4NGQtN2YwNzJiNTBlZjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Fox Searchlight Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:30:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001132/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Judi Dench"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0001132?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Barbara Covett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0313702/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tom Georgeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0313702?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ted Mawson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0768936/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Joanna Scanlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0768936?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sue Hodge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0448021/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Emma Kennedy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0448021?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Linda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1587166/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Andrew Simpson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm1587166?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Steven Connolly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0636637/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Wendy Nottingham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0636637?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Elaine Clifford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2473992/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Leon Skinner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm2473992?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Davis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1017334/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Juno Temple"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm1017334?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Polly Hart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000949/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cate Blanchett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0000949?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sheba Hart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0540585/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michael Maloney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0540585?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sandy Pabblem"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0662744/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Shaun Parkes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0662744?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bill Rumer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0474904/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Syreeta Kumar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0474904?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gita"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0205289/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Phil Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0205289?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Brian Bangs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0256658/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tameka Empson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0256658?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Antonia Robinson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0631490/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bill Nighy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0465551/characters/nm0631490?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Richard Hart"}]}]}

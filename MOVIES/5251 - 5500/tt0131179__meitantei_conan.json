Plot: a teenage detective protoge is turned into a kid by a weird poison and must help solve cases for his girlfriend's bumbling father under a alias until he can find the people who did this to him and recover an antidote. The premise, like I said, sounds kiddie but as the series rolls on things start to get messy and at times, a bit disturbing, but the cases are so ingenously planned out and executed you can't help but watch just to see how Jimmy/Conan will get the jobs done with such a small guise working against him. The animation is pretty good, bright and colorful though dated (eight years old now) but has its own style of anime. The dub isn't bad either, once again Funimation ,the folks doing the recording down here, have hired some excellent voice talent that matches each characters personalty very well though some tend to overact (the junior agency for example). Overall a great series that blends comedy and mystery very well. The only gripe being its very long (over 100 episodes) but still fun to watch. Give it a watch if you need a break from all the action animes or just a fan of Japanese cartoons in general. As Jimmy/Conan always say: \"With a keen eye for detail, one truth prevails.\""}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Case Closed: Season Two", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi75409689", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWVhN2MxYzgtZjA3Yi00ODlkLWFmOWYtNTE3NjM1YzYxNGQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWVhN2MxYzgtZjA3Yi00ODlkLWFmOWYtNTE3NjM1YzYxNGQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Case Closed: Season Two", "uploadDate": "2013-09-08T04:11:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0847439/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Minami Takayama"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0131179/characters/nm0847439?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Conan Edogawa"}, {"url": "#", "name": "446 episodes, 1996-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11432743/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hoang Khuyet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0131179/characters/nm11432743?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edogawa Conan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "328 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0847085/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wataru Takagi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0131179/characters/nm0847085?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Genta Kojima"}, {"url": "#", "name": "258 episodes, 1996-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0149218/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chaf\u00fbrin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0131179/characters/nm0149218?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Inspector Juzo Megure"}, {"url": "#", "name": "206 episodes, 1996-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0906722/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wakana Yamazaki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0131179/characters/nm0906722?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ran Mori"}, {"url": "#", "name": "337 episodes, 1996-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0436776/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Akira Kamiya"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0131179/characters/nm0436776?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kogoro Mori"}, {"url": "#", "name": "279 episodes, 1996-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11432745/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tran Vu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0131179/characters/nm11432745?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kogoro Mori"}, {"url": "#", "name": "254 episodes, 1996-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11432746/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Thuy Hang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0131179/characters/nm11432746?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mori Ran"}, {"url": "#", "name": "185 episodes, 1998-2006"}]}]}

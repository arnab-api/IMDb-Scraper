I would have to reply a resounding 'No.' However, that flies (like an angel?) in the face of the fact that I originally hired it, then bought it on DVD and have subsequently watched it a few times since. What can I say... I clearly have little taste in films! Sometimes you don't want DeNiro's excellent acting ability, or Christopher Nolan's tales of head-scratching, mind-bending concepts. You'll even forfeit decent dialogue and little character development for simple shooting monsters with big guns. And this is what you get right here.\n\nBasically, God himself is disillusioned with the human race and decides it's time to get rid of them (and kill a baby while he's at it). However, God's top angel (played by Paul Bettany) says 'No way!' and decides to save this special child and, while he's at it, all of us mortals. Now, if this sounds like a feat that couldn't possibly be crammed into just an hour and a half, it all takes place in a restaurant by a freeway in the middle of the desert. Our - sort of - winged hero has to help a band of human survivors fend off wave after wave of (fallen?) angels until the child is born.\n\nIt's basically a 'siege' movie. Think 'Assault on Precinct 13' but with monsters attacking those held up in a small, barricaded dwelling. There's nothing more grandiose than that, so if that's the sort of low-brow film you want to watch at the end of a long day's work then you should get what you're looking for. There's plenty of action and shoot-outs and for what it is it's not bad. Just don't go expecting anything too deep and dramatic and you won't be disappointed. Oh and Dennis Quaid is also in it - he tries to act his best with the script he's been given and occasionally comes close to succeeding. But then another battle comes along and you end up losing another extra in a hideous way possible.\n\nIt's not amazing, but then I don't think it ever tries to be. Know what it is and keep your expectations low. Don't worry, there's plenty of time to check your smartphone during the lulls in the action. You won't miss a thing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Legion: Thanksgiving Clip", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3208906009", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNTY2MzA0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE1MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNTY2MzA0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE1MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A holiday-themed clip from the movie Legion", "uploadDate": "2009-11-25T16:31:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0079273/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Bettany"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1038686/characters/nm0079273?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0879085/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tyrese Gibson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1038686/characters/nm0879085?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kyle Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001165/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charles S.

It is not as good as \"The notebook\", but it is better than \"Dear John\" and \"The lucky one\", in my opinion. Anyway, these four are very alike to each other and based on the respective novels written by the same author. Lasse Hallstrom proofs again he is an efficient director of dramas (I cannot say versatile, because he has not directed more genres ). He has been able to take advantage of the cast, which is not particularly great, but good enough. The photography is one of the best elements of the movie. It is mainly located in Northern Carolina (in a quiet coastal village) and I really liked the environment. The pace is fluid. It made me pay attention from the beginning. It does not obviously have the same pace that action movies should have. The plot contains just a few good unexpected twists and some flashbacks. The plot is easy to follow and adds no confusion, which is good. The acting is good enough. I am not a fan of any actor from this mo vie, but they all did a decent job and are believable in their respective roles. Josh Dushamel and Julianne Hough are the two leading ones, specially her, who is not famous at all. In conclusion, those who really like this sort of movies will surely enjoy this one even though it is not a top romantic drama. The intrigue and photography are added value. The cast is not great, but good enough. The film is well-paced, but it is not original at all. 7,25.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2406786073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE0NTA5NDgwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY2MTU2OA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE0NTA5NDgwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY2MTU2OA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A young woman with a mysterious past lands in Southport, North Carolina where her bond with a widower forces her to confront the dark secret that haunts her.", "uploadDate": "2012-10-25T11:29:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2584600/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Julianne Hough"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm2584600?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Katie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0463279/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jon Kohler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm0463279?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bus Station Clerk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2256017/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Lyons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm2256017?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tierney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0656045/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Giulia Pagano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm0656045?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pushy Bus Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0922307/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Red West"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm0922307?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Roger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5122514/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mimi Kirkland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm5122514?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lexie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3514006/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jasper Grey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm3514006?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bus Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5493553/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Wendy Wilmot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm5493553?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Realtor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0954529/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Irene Ziegler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm0954529?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mrs. Feldman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0660986/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tim Parati"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm0660986?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bus Station Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0241049/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Josh Duhamel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm0241049?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0682138/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Juan Piedrahita"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm0682138?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jr. Detective Ramirez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3470683/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Noah Lomax"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm3470683?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Josh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0612437/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robin Mullins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm0612437?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Maddie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2918317/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tora Hallstr\u00f6m"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1702439/characters/nm2918317?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ivan's Waitress"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Portuguese"], "Release Date": ["14 February 2013 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Safe Haven"], "Filming Locations": ["Southport, North Carolina, USA"], "Budget": ["$28,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$21,401,594,", "17 February 2013"], "Gross USA": ["$71,349,120"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$97,594,140"], "Production Co": ["Relativity Media", "Temple Hill Entertainment", "Nicholas Sparks Productions"], "Runtime": ["115 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Datasat", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

It's a light-hearted, low-key comedy about a hippie brother Ned (Paul Rudd) returning home from prison for selling pot to a uniformed policeman.\n\nThat little episode that put him in jail is not only humorous because of Ned's naivet\u00e9 but also because of his big heart that would empathize with the seemingly depressed cop and sell him the weed. Ned is a sweet idealist who believes the best about his fellow humans and rarely is disappointed. Although he has been a biodynamic farmer but now doesn't have a job, his real job is turning his family honest, sister by sister, without even trying, without even knowing that his Ibsen-like Wild Duck openness has changed lives for the better.\n\nFor instance, when he forces his sister Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) to be honest with her publisher about a source for an important story, she eventually is better for the setback. A little like Forrest Gump with less cluelessness, Ned changes things with the force of his own honesty.\n\nHis three sisters are not wicked witches; they're just New Yorkers who have lost their way in marriage, sexual orientation, or plain old occupation. Director Jesse Peretz keeps the cast underplaying as he allows the ripening of their lives through the gentle ministrations of this child-like brother.\n\nWhile I always favor the outr\u00e9 Royal Tenenbaums or eccentric Little Miss Sunshine, it's pleasant to experience a relatively mild comedy about family dysfunction and want more."}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Our Idiot Brother", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3651902489", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MTUxNTA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzExMDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MTUxNTA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzExMDMyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A pot bust sends nice-guy Ned (Rudd) to jail, and though he's released early on good behavior, he returns home to discover that his girlfriend has left and taken his dog with her.

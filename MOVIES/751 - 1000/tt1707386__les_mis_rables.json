So it took me a few minutes to get into the big chorus, singing dialogue thing here but early on I did. To speak of the first hour I had characters I engaged with, songs that mostly are memorable (although the singing is variable) and generally plenty of spectacle and flair in the delivery. The first hour of the film is by far the strongest and it contains a lot of the most emotionally moving aspects.\n\nMuch has been said about Hathaway and, sort of as a result I wasn't sure how much of it was hype for awards and how much of it was real, but she really is very good throughout her section. The highlight is of course I Dream a Dream, but her whole performance is emotionally charged but yet fragile at the same time. Problem is that with this and other strengths in the first hour, the rest of the film has a lot to live up to and, mostly, it doesn't really manage it. It runs to almost 3 hours and it really does feel long but weirdly at the same time it also feels rushed. It is hard to describe but the amount of story to be told seems too much to really fit in and do it well. As a result it never grabbed me quite as much as it had in that first hour; I still enjoyed it for its flair and spectacle but it felt like that is what I was watching, rather than characters or a story.\n\nBeyond Hathaway the cast are not quite as strong. Jackman does well but not amazing; Seyfried is okay while Redmanye, Barks, Tveit and others are solid. Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter both overplay it but are amusing. The only real weak link is Crowe and it is a shame because he actually fits his character very well, it is just the fact that his singing voice is strained that poses a problem \u2013 but it is a big problem when you're making a musical. The production values are tremendously high, with great sets, great costumes and around these Hooper gives us some great set-pieces \u2013 with the downside of this being that it all seems so surface that it highlights the increasingly lack of much else going on elsewhere.\n\nThe film still is worth a look for this, but it is a shame that it peaks so early and only seems to slip away from there. It manages to feel overlong while also feeling rushed and needing more time; perhaps me not naturally being drawn to musicals was part of the issue, but it is a flawed but expensive film."}, "duration": "PT2H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Winner: Best Supporting Actress", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2712512281", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5ODYxODY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3OTc3OA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5ODYxODY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3OTc3OA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch a TV trailer for Les Miserables.", "uploadDate": "2012-11-27T17:47:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413168/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hugh Jackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm0413168?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jean Valjean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004266/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anne Hathaway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm0004266?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Fantine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0056187/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sacha Baron Cohen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm0056187?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Th\u00e9nardier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1519666/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Eddie Redmayne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm1519666?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Marius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2885819/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Samantha Barks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm2885819?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "\u00c9ponine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0180470/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cavin Cornwall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm0180470?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Convict 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3641075/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dave Hawley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm3641075?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Convict 3"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5390145/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Barr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm5390145?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Convict 5"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000128/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Russell Crowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm0000128?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Javert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1086543/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Amanda Seyfried"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm1086543?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cosette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000307/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Helena Bonham Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm0000307?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Madame Th\u00e9nardier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3117836/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Aaron Tveit"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm3117836?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Enjolras"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4948519/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Daniel Huttlestone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm4948519?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gavroche"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1086981/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Josef Altin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm1086981?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Convict 2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5391416/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Adam Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1707386/characters/nm5391416?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Convict 4"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK", "USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["25 December 2012 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Les Miz"], "Filming Locations": ["The Historic Dockyard Chatham, Chatham, Kent, England, UK"], "Budget": ["$61,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$27,281,735,", "30 December 2012"], "Gross USA": ["$148,809,770"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$441,809,770"], "Production Co": ["Universal Pictures", "Working Title Films", "Cameron Mackintosh Ltd."], "Runtime": ["158 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Datasat", "SDDS", "Dolby Surround 7.1", "Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

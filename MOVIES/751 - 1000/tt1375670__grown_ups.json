When seeing the previews I thought with a cast like this you can't go wrong, it must be a goldmine of laughs! But after watching the movie my feelings changed a lot. Sure there were a few moments that made me laugh but to tell you the truth a lot of the jokes were over used and got tiring. I felt as if they were trying too hard to make the audience laugh and that they were trying to fit in as many jokes as they could into each scene. Of course it's not the most horrible movie i've seen. I just don't think the plot was strong enough and I don't get the same charming and funny vibe I usually get when watching a movie with any of these actors in it. I feel that a lot of the movie was also was very clich\u00e9 and predictable. I do think that this movie could have been a lot better. It was entertaining enough, but I can truthfully say I won't be buying this one on DVD.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Grown Ups: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3618113305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend", "uploadDate": "2010-04-21T07:40:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001191/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Adam Sandler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0001191?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lenny Feder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001674/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chris Rock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0001674?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kurt McKenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001705/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rob Schneider"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0001705?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rob Hilliard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004742/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maria Bello"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0004742?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sally Lamonsoff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0887696/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joyce Van Patten"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0887696?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gloria"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1288309/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Di Quon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm1288309?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rita"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0703800/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Colin Quinn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0703800?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dickie Bailey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2576486/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Madison Riley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm2576486?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jasmine Hilliard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416673/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kevin James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0416673?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eric Lamonsoff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005450/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "David Spade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0005450?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Marcus Higgins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000161/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Salma Hayek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0000161?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Roxanne Chase-Feder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0748973/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Maya Rudolph"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0748973?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Deanne McKenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0423284/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ebony Jo-Ann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0423284?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mama Ronzoni"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000114/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Steve Buscemi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0000114?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Wiley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005218/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tim Meadows"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1375670/characters/nm0005218?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Malcolm"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["25 June 2010 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Mad Families"], "Filming Locations": ["Woodmans of Essex, 121 Main Street, Essex, Massachusetts, USA"], "Budget": ["$80,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$40,506,562,", "27 June 2010"], "Gross USA": ["$162,001,186"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$271,457,301"], "Production Co": ["Columbia Pictures", "Relativity Media", "Happy Madison Productions"], "Runtime": ["102 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "DTS", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

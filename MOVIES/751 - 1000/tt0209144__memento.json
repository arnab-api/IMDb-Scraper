Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.\n\nMemento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.\n\nPlainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.\n\nThe film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!\n\nThis review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.\n\nPS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive."}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Memento", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3220356889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhmZDI0MWEtNWIzOS00YjBjLWE0YjgtYzdlOTY4MGQ0N2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhmZDI0MWEtNWIzOS00YjBjLWE0YjgtYzdlOTY4MGQ0N2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-10-11T17:10:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001602/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Guy Pearce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0001602?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Leonard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001592/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joe Pantoliano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0001592?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Teddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0270383/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Russ Fega"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0270383?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0864997/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Stephen Tobolowsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0864997?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sammy Jankis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0502073/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Thomas Lennon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0502073?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Doctor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132649/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kimberly Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0132649?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Blonde"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390227/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Larry Holden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0390227?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jimmy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005251/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0005251?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Natalie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0095478/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mark Boone Junior"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0095478?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Burt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0289080/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jorja Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0289080?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Leonard's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364748/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Harriet Sansom Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0364748?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mrs. Jankis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719678/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Callum Keith Rennie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0719678?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dodd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0611127/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Marianne Muellerleile"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0209144/characters/nm0611127?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tattooist"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["25 May 2001 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Memento"], "Filming Locations": ["Hill Crest Inn, 9111 Sepulveda Blvd, North Hills, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$9,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$235,488,", "18 March 2001"], "Gross USA": ["$25,544,867"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$40,047,078"], "Production Co": ["Newmarket Capital Group", "Team Todd", "I Remember Productions"], "Runtime": ["113 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

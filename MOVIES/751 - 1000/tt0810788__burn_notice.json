I was totally engaged the moment Michael got his burn notice when he called to make the wire transfer--seeing the wheels turn for that beat before smiling and turning to the Russian mobster was sublime. This show has edge and attitude to burn, no pun intended, and I hope it keeps it--the only thing that could dull it would be any hint of silliness (Bruce Campbell's character needs to demonstrate some ass-kicking spy mojo somewhere along the line). Matt Nix: You've done a fantastic job on the writing, great casting (Jeff Donovan is a \"Where'd he come from?\" find), locations, etc. Keep the edge. The first two shows were great, can't wait to see what's next."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Burn Notice: Season Five", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi900637977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0YTYzYzEtNTQxZS00NWY4LWJhNGQtNjExMjI2ODdmYTZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0YTYzYzEtNTQxZS00NWY4LWJhNGQtNjExMjI2ODdmYTZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Burn Notice: Season Five", "uploadDate": "2012-07-12T03:10:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0232998/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeffrey Donovan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0810788/characters/nm0232998?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Westen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132257/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bruce Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0810788/characters/nm0132257?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sam Axe"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068117/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Coby Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0810788/characters/nm0068117?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jesse Porter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "67 episodes, 2010-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000270/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gabrielle Anwar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0810788/characters/nm0000270?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Fiona Glenanne"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002102/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sharon Gless"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0810788/characters/nm0002102?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Madeline Westen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["28 June 2007 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Burn Notice"], "Filming Locations": ["Miami, Florida, USA"], "Production Co": ["Fabrik Entertainment", "Flying Glass of Milk Productions", "Fox Television Studios"], "Runtime": ["44 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

However, every time I mention this film, I have to answer most people's quizzical looks with \"It's a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s.\" After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.\n\nDead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring, uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here, we see one of his very personal and cradled projects, and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect, with every shot, along with the editing, seamless. Also very compelling are the color-tones in every scene, perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.\n\nThen we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen). His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable, every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact - dare I say it? - he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the free-thinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household name/Hollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration, energy, and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh, unhindered, and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character. The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles's role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course, all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.\n\nAnd lastly, the story. I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone. I have personally heard from nine-to-fivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs, careers, relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000245/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robin Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0000245?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Keating"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000160/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ethan Hawke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0000160?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Todd Anderson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0360796/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gale Hansen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0360796?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charlie Dalton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0749456/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Allelon Ruggiero"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0749456?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Steven Meeks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0516093/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Norman Lloyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0516093?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Nolan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0069724/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carla Belver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0069724?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Perry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0552327/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "George Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0552327?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dr. Hager"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0136999/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Matt Carey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0136999?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hopkins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000494/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Sean Leonard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0000494?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Neil Perry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001038/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Josh Charles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0001038?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Knox Overstreet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0476378/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dylan Kussman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0476378?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Richard Cameron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0914209/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James Waterston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0914209?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gerard Pitts"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001748/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kurtwood Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0001748?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mr. Perry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0694676/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Leon Pownall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0694676?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "McAllister"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0041767/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Joe Aufiery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097165/characters/nm0041767?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Chemistry Teacher"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Latin"], "Release Date": ["9 June 1989 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Dead Poets Society"], "Filming Locations": ["Everett Theatre - 47 West Main Street, Middletown, Delaware, USA"], "Budget": ["$16,400,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$340,456,", "4 June 1989"], "Gross USA": ["$95,860,116"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$235,860,116"], "Production Co": ["Touchstone Pictures", "Silver Screen Partners IV", "A Steven Haft Production"], "Runtime": ["128 min", "140 min", "(laserdisc)"], "Sound Mix": ["70 mm 6-Track", "(70 mm prints)", "Dolby Stereo", "(35 mm prints)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

The show is about a smart, fearless 17-year-old girl named Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) who is an apprentice to her father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni from \"Just Shoot Me\") who is a former sheriff and has Veronica help him with his struggling new private investigator business. By sneaking through back alleys and scoping out no-tell motels with a telescopic-lens camera and her math book, Veronica attempts to uncover the California beach town's darkest secrets, including who killed her best friend and Duncan's sister, Lilly, and created a scandal that cost her father his job, his home and wife. Pushed to the edge of this multicultural, venomous little Peyton Place, Veronica Mars relentlessly continues to search for evidence that will clear her father's name and get her back into the \"in-crowd,\" but what she finds may tear the town of Neptune apart at the seams. The show I think is like those detective book novels almost. I like this show! I think Kristen Bell is going to be the next Sarah Michelle Gellar! This show premiered on UPN September 2004. I hope this show lasts more than one season!\n\nUser Rating: 9/10\n\nBOTTOM LINE: THIS SHOW IS SO COOL!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1849539609", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Y2U5NWEtMGVhZC00ZTM4LTgzNzUtYTgxM2I1MDY0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Y2U5NWEtMGVhZC00ZTM4LTgzNzUtYTgxM2I1MDY0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Spring breakers are getting murdered in Neptune, thereby decimating the seaside town's tourist industry.

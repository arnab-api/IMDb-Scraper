Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie \"The help\" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.\n\nPhilippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51, got a dramatic para-glider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his life-aid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title \"the second breath\" (in French \"Le second souffl\u00e9\"). The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France, and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning, a former convict, is capable progressively to change his views, and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch, his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter, everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance, and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.\n\n09/07/2013 : I've just seen that under \"Crazy credits\" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi59285529", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk3MDQyMjk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIxNjU0NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjk3MDQyMjk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTIxNjU0NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat hires a young man from the projects to be his caretaker.", "uploadDate": "2012-03-29T07:45:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167388/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm0167388?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Philippe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0494504/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anne Le Ny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm0494504?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Yvonne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1525639/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jos\u00e9phine de Meaux"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm1525639?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "La DRH soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de courses"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2031248/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alba Ga\u00efa Bellugi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm2031248?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Elisa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5511912/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Salimata Kamate"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm5511912?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Fatou"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0644314/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gr\u00e9goire Oestermann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm0644314?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Antoine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0139107/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Caron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm0139107?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ami de Philippe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4552893/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Thomas Soliv\u00e9r\u00e8s"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm4552893?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bastien - dit le Plumeau"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1082477/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Omar Sy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm1082477?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Driss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1109153/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Audrey Fleurot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm1109153?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Magalie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597042/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Clotilde Mollet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm0597042?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marcelle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3994610/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cyril Mendy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm3994610?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Adama"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5511483/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Absa Diatou Toure"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm5511483?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0196839/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dominique Daguier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm0196839?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Amie de Philippe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0024634/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Christian Ameri"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675434/characters/nm0024634?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Albert"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["France"], "Language": ["French", "English"], "Release Date": ["2 November 2011 (France)"], "Also Known As": ["The Intouchables"], "Filming Locations": ["Paris, France"], "Budget": ["EUR9,500,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$103,507,", "27 May 2012"], "Gross USA": ["$10,198,820"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$426,588,510"], "Production Co": ["Quad Productions", "Ten Films", "Canal+"], "Runtime": ["112 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

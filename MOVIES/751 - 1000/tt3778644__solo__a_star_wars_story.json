Solo: A Star Wars Story is just another movie in the ocean of bad ones that tries to aim for the lowest common denominator in order to bring some bucks for the studio behind it, while it also shamelessly tries to capitalize on the Star Wars name that seen better days.\n\n It doesn't have a clear vision - hell, it doesn't have any at all. The pacing of it is all over the place. The story is cliched, weak, it lacks a strong direction. The jokes most of the time fall flat - most of the time they do not work or feel inappropriate and forced. Also the movie's tone is quite inconsistent, while the actors don't really do a convincing job portraying their characters either.\n\nThis movie sums up perfectly what Star Wars has become. What once was the holy grail of pop-culture and a shining beacon of hope that showed how mass-appealing movies can carry just as important messages as art-house movies and dramas, turned into something that's anything but reminiscent of Star Wars. It feels like a 4 days old dry burger from a fast-food restaurant that was halfly chewed and spitted out.\n\nThere's only one good thing in this movie that leads to my two star rating: as much as it tried through it's entire runtime, it wasn't able to spin SW in the mud the way The Last Jedi did. This movie just wasn't able to be as disrespectful to the world and characters of Star Wars and to it's fans as The Last Jedi was. Because making such an unbelievably bad and insulting movie takes true talent - that the 'masterminds' behind Solo (fortunately) did not have. Or maybe it just wasn't able to make things worse, because Rian Johnson already killed the Star Wars movies, at least in my eyes."}, "duration": "PT2H15M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1229043737", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI2NGY3NmMtNGY5NC00ODZlLTk1ODUtOTNhNWRkY2NiNTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI2NGY3NmMtNGY5NC00ODZlLTk1ODUtOTNhNWRkY2NiNTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-05-02T17:37:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2403277/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alden Ehrenreich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm2403277?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Han Solo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Beckett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2255973/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Donald Glover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm2255973?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lando Calrissian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3564817/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Phoebe Waller-Bridge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm3564817?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "L3-37"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269463/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jon Favreau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm0269463?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rio Durant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001373/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Linda Hunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm0001373?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lady Proxima"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1732270/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Tui"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm1732270?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Korso"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940100/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Andrew Woodall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm0940100?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Imperial Recruitment Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6934058/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joonas Suotamo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm6934058?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chewbacca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3592338/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Emilia Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm3592338?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Qi'ra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0628601/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Thandiwe Newton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm0628601?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Val"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0079273/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Paul Bettany"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm0079273?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dryden Vos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7210986/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Erin Kellyman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm7210986?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Enfys Nest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2498053/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ian Kenny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm2498053?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rebolt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0290693/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Anna Francolini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3778644/characters/nm0290693?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Imperial Emigration Officer"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["25 May 2018 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Star Wars: Red Cup"], "Filming Locations": ["Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England, UK"], "Budget": ["$275,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$84,420,489,", "27 May 2018"], "Gross USA": ["$213,767,512"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$392,924,807"], "Production Co": ["Lucasfilm", "Walt Disney Pictures", "Allison Shearmur Productions"], "Runtime": ["135 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Atmos", "DTS", "(DTS: X)", "12-Track Digital Sound", "Auro 11.1", "Dolby Digital", "Dolby Surround 7.1"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

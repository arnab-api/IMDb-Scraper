The network used to broadcast only shows that the 65 and over crowd would enjoy.  This is a very, very funny show! \n\n Now, most sitcoms depend a lot on forced humor.  This show doesn't.  The writing and performances are very natural.  And I never watch the show without getting at least 10 good laughs.  \n\nKevin James is a great, underrated comedian.  He should really get more recognition for his talent.  He always cracks me up.  Kevin's not a bland comic, yet he doesn't go over-the-top.  He has just the right anecdote to produce big laughs.  By the way, he hosted the \"People's Choice Awards\" and he was great!  It was hilarious when he walked off stage in his boxers. \n\n Jerry Stiller, thankfully, gets the chance to once again display his incredible talent.  He was memorable as Frank Costanza on \"Seinfeld\" and he's actually given a role that lives up to it.  I guess you can say he's the one \"Seinfeld\" cast member, as of now, who's still a television success. \n\nLeah Remini is a beautiful actress.  She is great to look at, and has a superb sense of timing.  She holds her own, not getting upstaged by the two professional comedians.  \n\nIf you haven't checked out the show as of yet, I really suggest you do. It's one of the few funny shows on television.  I'm really discerning when it comes to sitcoms, so take my word for it--it's great! \n\n My score:  8 (out of 10)"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The King of Queens", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3824419097", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFiZTkyNTMtM2ExYy00YjhkLTg5NWEtMjI5YmMwMWRjODZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFiZTkyNTMtM2ExYy00YjhkLTg5NWEtMjI5YmMwMWRjODZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:51:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416673/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165581/characters/nm0416673?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Doug Heffernan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "206 episodes, 1998-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005467/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jerry Stiller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165581/characters/nm0005467?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Arthur Spooner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "206 episodes, 1998-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0652663/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patton Oswalt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165581/characters/nm0652663?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Spence Olchin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "179 episodes, 1998-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005474/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nicole Sullivan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165581/characters/nm0005474?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Holly Shumpert"}, {"url": "#", "name": "83 episodes, 2001-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0718957/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Leah Remini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165581/characters/nm0718957?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carrie Heffernan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "206 episodes, 1998-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931879/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Victor Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165581/characters/nm0931879?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Deacon Palmer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "195 episodes, 1998-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0884230/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Gary Valentine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0165581/characters/nm0884230?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Danny Heffernan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "136 episodes, 1999-2007"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["21 September 1998 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The King of Queens"], "Filming Locations": ["Cooper's Ale House, Glendale, Queens, New York City, New York, USA"], "Production Co": ["Columbia TriStar Television", "Sony Pictures Television", "CBS Paramount Network Television"], "Runtime": ["22 min", "(206 episodes)"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

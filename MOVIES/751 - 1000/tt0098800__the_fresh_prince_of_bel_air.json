I was into manga, nickelodeon, Disney etc. However, now I am 25 i decided to go through all the TV shows I missed whilst growing up and this was one of them. Boy oh boy, I was not disappointed. Despite the last show being run over 20 years ago, this comedy is well worth the watch. Will Smith is obviously the star, but the performances by every single person in the Banks family was memorable. Some episodes were there just for the laughs, some were slower and some had serious learning reflections. The latter is what made this show stand out. Going from an episode that made me laugh to one with a serious message of gun control or racism sets this show apart from the majority of sitcoms. It was, well, a fresh experience. \n\nOne of the few gripes I had was that some of the jokes were repeated many, many times. It did start to grate on me when Will would say \"You know what I'm sayyyyyiiinnnngggg?\" in that characteristic tone. The other thing that slightly annoyed me was the re-casting of Vivian. I understand why it happened, but I just do not think the replacement was anywhere near as good.\n\nOther than these minor points, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show from S01E01 to S06E24. If you have not watched this show before, you should. If you have seen this show before, you probably should watch it again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4005740825", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjIyMmU5MDktZWM0Ni00NWNhLTk0OWMtNjA1ODkxYTNhNzllXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjIyMmU5MDktZWM0Ni00NWNhLTk0OWMtNjA1ODkxYTNhNzllXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "30 years later, we're bringing the Banks family back together.

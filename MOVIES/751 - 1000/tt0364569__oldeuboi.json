I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.\n\nWhen I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.\n\nSimply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Oldboy (2003)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3130917145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNmNTZjMDgtYWMzMC00ZWUyLTk4ODYtMTA5NTYwNjU5ZmEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNmNTZjMDgtYWMzMC00ZWUyLTk4ODYtMTA5NTYwNjU5ZmEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Tartan Films", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:31:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0158856/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Choi Min-sik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm0158856?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dae-su Oh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1367246/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kang Hye-jeong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1367246?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mi-do"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1203041/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dae-han Ji"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1203041?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "No Joo-hwan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1800416/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Seung-shin Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1800416?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Yoo Hyung-ja"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0644905/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tae-kyung Oh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm0644905?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Young Dae-su"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1880422/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Il-han Oo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1880422?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Young Joo-hwan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3727149/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young-ae Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm3727149?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Elevator Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4226710/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jae-Duk Han"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm4226710?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Night Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0949167/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Yoo Ji-Tae"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm0949167?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Woo-jin Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1366028/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kim Byeong-Ok"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1366028?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mr. Han"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1367681/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dal-su Oh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1367681?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Park Cheol-woong"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1517134/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jin-Seo Yoon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1517134?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lee Soo-ah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1881661/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Yoo Yeon-Seok"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1881661?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Young Woo-Jin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11543923/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Young-hee Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm11543923?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Clock Store Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1779499/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mi Mi Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364569/characters/nm1779499?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Dental Nurse"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["South Korea"], "Language": ["Korean"], "Release Date": ["21 November 2003 (South Korea)"], "Also Known As": ["Oldboy"], "Filming Locations": ["Songgye High School, Chinju, Kyongsangnam-Do, South Korea"], "Budget": ["$3,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$68,957,", "27 March 2005"], "Gross USA": ["$707,481"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$15,002,116"], "Production Co": ["Show East", "Egg Films"], "Runtime": ["120 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Dolby Surround 7.1"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

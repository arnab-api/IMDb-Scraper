The acting was powerful all the way through. It has gripping emotions from start to finish that shows how bad you have to work, and to want something, to succeed when all the cards are stacked against you. Some may find this to be a \"woe is me\" kind of story, but I think it showed the never quitting spirit that Southerners have. Honestly, it's better than the professional critic reviews that I've read.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the film and the story behind it. That to say, I can't figure out why this film is getting low ratings, but I think it's worth the watch. Currently it's in select theatres until 24 November when it releases onto Netflix in Canada.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "A Ron Howard Film", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2918301977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY3YzIyODAtNGVhNy00NmYwLTg2NzAtODZhZWFiOTk4NGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODY3YzIyODAtNGVhNy00NmYwLTg2NzAtODZhZWFiOTk4NGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "J.D.

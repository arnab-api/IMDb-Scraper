It's less of a comedy but enjoyable nonetheless, made that way by the star, Ginnifer Goodwin.\n\nI can say that this is the first film where I have decided to buy a ticket based solely on the presence in it of Ginnifer Goodwin. I wasn't disappointed. She is luminous in most of the scenes she's in - and there are a lot of them considering she's the central character. She's never looked more alluring, more beautiful. But it's her delivery of the material that's the most satisfying. She is just a truly wonderful actress and she breathes real life into the part of Rachel, making us truly her ally in helping her achieve success and happiness.\n\nGoodwin is solidly backed by the lovely Kate Hudson as Darcy. Hudson is in perhaps her best performance as an over the top, somewhat obnoxious, intellectually challenged, manic blond filled with an almost mean-spirited, selfish self-interest. She is on the border of mercilessly taunting Goodwin's character in much of the film and Goodwin, playing ever the gracious friend, puts up with her friends excesses. The graciousness meets it's biggest challenge when her college study mate Dex, played by Colin Egglesfield, is swept out from under Rachel by the overbearing Darcy, who always gets what she wants.\n\nThe interplay between these two actresses is a definite cut above the usual silliness of romantic comedies and Goodwin comes off looking much the better of the two, but that may be partly due to the greater sympathetic nature of her character. If you really watch Hudson she's riveting in places.\n\nThe men in this offering, Egglesfield, John Krasinski and Steve Howey do their level best to provide counterpoint to the two leading ladies, but ultimately it's all about the girls. Krasinski is the most watchable, and likely the better actor but Howey adds some oddball charm that also makes it a better film. At one point Hudson refers to him as a caveman; that's an apt description.\n\nFinally, there is a character named Claire played to a turn by the terminally cute Ashley Williams. She's fun to watch.\n\nAll-in-all it's a good movie to take your favorite girl to.\n\nBy Bruce L.

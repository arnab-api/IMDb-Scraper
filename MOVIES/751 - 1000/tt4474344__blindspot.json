The FBI discovers that each tattoo contains a clue to a crime they will have to solve.\n\nCreative, exciting, new twists, great action; why do we watch TV? There's always a new clue, a new story, a twist to add that keeps you wanting to watch the next week. She is a top trained pro, and there is a level of doubt. The character interactions between Jane and Heller are complex, close, tense, loving yet harsh and unpredictable. The build-up of all the characters on the team is well thought out, not haphazard, and slowly creates a solid cast, just like CSI Miami, or the Sopranos was developed. This show captures your interest and is unlike another cop, medical or court series I've seen in a long-time.\n\nI really looked forward to this show and I am not at all disappointed. I cant give it a 10 but a 9 does just fine. The characters are interesting and I find myself looking forward to each episode! 7/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New York Comic Con Season 3 Sneak Peek", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1315879193", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc3YjYwNmQtZjNhYi00Nzk4LWE3OGItMjIzODA1M2U4YmM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc3YjYwNmQtZjNhYi00Nzk4LWE3OGItMjIzODA1M2U4YmM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The cast of \"Blindspot\" had a blast when they returned to New York Comic Con with an appearance this weekend.

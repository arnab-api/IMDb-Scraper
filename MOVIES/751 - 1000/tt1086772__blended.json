He went from doing hilarious and heartfelt comedies that only he can do, to stupid and meaningless comedies and second grader can do better. Deep within Adam Sandler is a gifted actor that can light up the screen, if given a good script and a good director. Watch his 2007 drama, Reign Over Me. It is his only movie where he does not deliver any ounce of comedy. By the looks of Blended, he is moving back in that serious direction.\n\nClick was Sandler's last truly great film. I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry (I found) was his last truly hilarious film. Funny People wasn't quite at the level of others, but I thought it would help his career. He buried Funny People and his other classics with bad movies like Jack & Jill, Grown Ups 2 and That's My Boy. I had my doubts for Blended, (you can't really blame me) but I can comfortably say that this is his best movie in years. Best since Funny People. He teams up with Drew Barrymore for a third time in a splendid and delightful flick. Although this is not as good as their previous collaborations, it is a step up for Sandler's recent string.\n\nI will start by saying that Blended has some parallels to Sandler's recent string of movies. Those are: bad acting and no hilarity. The acting is a step up, since you can get used to it, whereas you couldn't in his others. I remember reading about Free Willy and saying over 1000 kids auditioned for the role of Jesse before settling on Jason James Richter. Adam Sandler probably did 10 or 20 before deciding on some of his cast members. That leads into there being nothing funny. Sandler tries his darndest to incorporate as much laughter as he possibly can, but fails at every angle. There were some parts the somewhat tickled me and did grin at, but none of them were truly funny.\n\nSandler has lost his touch in making funny movies, but he has proved that Blended does not need true comedy, just warmth and delight. If he didn't try so hard to make a gut-busting romantic-comedy, the result would have been better. The comedy fails, but the drama portion succeeds in ways I thought Sandler could never do. This is his best serious flick he has done since Click back in 2006. When I said the acting is bad but not that bad, it is because it subsides and becomes good in the serious bits. Only during the comedy bits does the acting become bad.\n\nSandler and Barrymore go on a disastrous blind date with each other then wind-up on an African vacation together. The African bits are a joy to see. They have kids of the opposite genders, so they help out each other's kids as they need an adult figure of their same sex. They do so in touching ways. We all know that Sandler and Barrymore end up together at the end, but it is worth seeing how they do so. In 2011's Just Go With It, everything was so predictable it was boring. Blended leaves for some intrigue and wanting to sit through it. There actually is a point in the movie where the comedy seems to literally disappear and the movie becomes all-around better. I am proud of Adam Sandler for doing a movie where the seriousness is a true winner.\n\n2.5/4", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1503898905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI4MDI2ODM1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUxNjIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODI4MDI2ODM1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUxNjIyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After a bad blind date, a man and woman find themselves stuck together at a resort for families, where their attraction grows as their respective kids benefit from the burgeoning relationship.", "uploadDate": "2014-04-05T10:16:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001191/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Adam Sandler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm0001191?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005265/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin Nealon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm0005265?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1018488/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wendi McLendon-Covey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm1018488?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0570364/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joel McHale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm0570364?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mark"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3148043/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jessica Lowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm3148043?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ginger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3409535/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Emma Fuhrmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm3409535?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Espn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2417490/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kyle Red Silverstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm2417490?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0641944/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Shaquille O'Neal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm0641944?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Doug"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000106/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Drew Barrymore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm0000106?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lauren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0187719/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Terry Crews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm0187719?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nickens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2254074/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bella Thorne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm2254074?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Hilary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0628951/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Abdoulaye NGom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm0628951?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mfana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4758216/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Braxton Beckham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm4758216?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Brendan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4865040/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Alyvia Alyn Lind"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm4865040?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lou"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4706267/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Zak Henri"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1086772/characters/nm4706267?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jake"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["23 May 2014 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Familymoon"], "Filming Locations": ["South Africa"], "Budget": ["$40,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$14,284,031,", "25 May 2014"], "Gross USA": ["$46,294,610"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$127,994,610"], "Production Co": ["Gulfstream Pictures", "Happy Madison Productions", "Karz Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["117 min"], "Sound Mix": ["SDDS", "Datasat", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

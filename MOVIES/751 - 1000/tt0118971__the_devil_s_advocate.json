The purpose behind it is to create a moral drama about the fight between good and evil in a man, or the devil's everlasting quest to conquer man's soul. In retrospective, there are few movies I've seen that bring out such strong feelings in me. Specially the first hour. We follow a young couple, played by Reeves and Theron in her first big picture, who move to New York from the south when he is given a job as attorney in one of the biggest firms in the country. We see the change come in Kevin as he is introduced to a world of luxury and pleasure by his boss, THE DEVIL, played by old master Al Pacino.\n\nThe ending brings a new, unpredictable and great twist to the story. I will not give it away. The supporting cast is pretty strong, specially Jeffrey Jones who plays a senior partner in Lucifer Pacino's firm and who first arises the suspicion in Kevin/Keanu with his mysterious behaviour, and Connie Nielsen as Cristabella, an extremely hot Italian colleague who is the very symbol of temptation. Nielsen looked even better here than in \"Gladiator\" and her performance is also more interesting. Charlize Theron displayed her range here for the first time, showing she had a great potential to become a star with her mix of ethereal beauty and acting talent. Reeves was also very good as the hotshot attorney and his looks elevated his macho hero potential. Al Pacino didn't disappoint, but his performance here counts as one of his least spectacular.\n\nThis is a dark movie with elements of horror and some gore and sex thrown in for good measure. I think Taylor Hackford never did it better. He gave us something to ponder on while entertaining and scaring us at the same time. It is a film one can't forget.9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H24M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Devil's Advocate", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2728460569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWVmYjE5YTQtN2Y2Yy00NGI4LWE5NTUtYTM3NGUyZTMyN2YzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWVmYjE5YTQtN2Y2Yy00NGI4LWE5NTUtYTM3NGUyZTMyN2YzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:50:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000206/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Keanu Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118971/characters/nm0000206?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Lomax"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000234/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charlize Theron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118971/characters/nm0000234?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mary Ann Lomax"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0412382/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Judith Ivey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118971/characters/nm0412382?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Alice Lomax"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005266/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Craig T.

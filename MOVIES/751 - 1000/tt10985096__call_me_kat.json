I'll have to watch the original, but in the meantime, I really like the character of Kat. Admittingly, in the first ten minutes of the first episode, I was really annoyed with her turning to the camera seemingly every 10 seconds. After the first episode though, it's not as often and becomes more natural to the flow of the show.\n\nI noticed people are complaining about Kat's confidence and enthusiasm when the original character of Miranda is apparently more awkward and insecure. While I can understand that, I like that Kat is confident. She's a 39 year old woman who owns her own business and knows who she is, while remaining approachable and imperfect. It's a welcome change in my opinion as the awkward shy character who blossoms has been done many times already.\n\nAlso, American sitcoms have just always been different than British shows. I love that British shows tend to have more character development and usually a very defined story to the season because a season (or series as they say) is usually only 6 episodes. American sitcoms go for over 20 episodes a season most of the time and are more about making us laugh and escape for a half hour than they are about engrossing us in someone's struggle. Both have their place and can be very enjoyable.\n\nI'll probably enjoy Miranda when I get to watching it, and perhaps my opinion on Kat will change, but for now I really like this show. The lightheartedness is a welcome escape from reality nowadays, the jokes make me laugh, and as a side note, I also like the atmosphere, set design, and architecture. The building that houses Kat's home and business is inviting and has very cool features.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Call Me Kat", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1732231449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMyZTA2NTUtMTg2ZC00NTE5LTk2NzYtMzkxZGZkMWFhZTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMyZTA2NTUtMTg2ZC00NTE5LTk2NzYtMzkxZGZkMWFhZTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2020-12-04T17:02:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0080524/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mayim Bialik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10985096/characters/nm0080524?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kat"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0430074/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Leslie Jordan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10985096/characters/nm0430074?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Phil"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2091145/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cheyenne Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10985096/characters/nm2091145?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Max"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5575832/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Schuyler Helford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10985096/characters/nm5575832?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brigitte"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001436/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Swoosie Kurtz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10985096/characters/nm0001436?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sheila"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0695497/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kyla Pratt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10985096/characters/nm0695497?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Randi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3307497/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Julian Gant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10985096/characters/nm3307497?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Carter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK", "USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["3 January 2021 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Call Me Kat"], "Filming Locations": ["Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Farm Kid", "BBC Studios", "That's Wonderful Productions"], "Runtime": ["21 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

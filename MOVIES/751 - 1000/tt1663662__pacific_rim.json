It seems to hide away as we get older, but was always strong and persistent when we were children. We could sit down and really make something out of nothing physical, or tip our toy-box all over the floor and just go mad. Pacific Rim is Guillermo Del Toro at his most unleashed. He's been given the toys for his sandpit and has gone completely bonkers, but he has also created a sense of wonder from completely nothing.\n\nThe plot is simple. Kaiju (monsters) from another dimension break through to ours and wage war on the planet and us humans must do what we can to stop them. So we build giant machines called Jaegers. General audiences are doing the worst thing by comparing this to Transformers or Battleship simply because of some simple image traits. Well I'm here to tell you that you're way off and also working comparisons in the wrong league. Del Toro has crafted an insane amalgamation of Sci-Fi, old-school thrills, special effects and brilliantly entertaining set pieces that all meld together in beautiful harmony, with just enough satisfying human moments and arcs that carry a nice balance of emotion and camp. It all blends well with the loopiness of it all. Its Guillermo Del Toro's trademarks turned up to 11, all while going nuts and having fun with his toys.\n\nThere's just so much to love, that not even some minor pacing problems or a couple of sub-par performances can destroy the experience. Mainly its in the lesser background characters, but for me I'd say that Charlie Hunnam doesn't quite shine in the lead. He's certainly more than commendable, but he just doesn't break out here. Idris Elba steals the spotlight with a look and a bellowed delivery and its amusing to watch and Rinko Kikuchi has such an incredible skill with her mannerism and in her eyes, that's its a shock that she isn't in more films. Ron Perlman comes and goes and works his usual incredible moments.\n\nPacific Rim is triumphant above the rest of the blockbuster herd. It knows what is missing from the norm and just goes crazy with it. Its a big, giant load of awesome fun. Prepare your jaw muscles, because you'll be smiling throughout.\n\n(Hint: Stay a couple of minutes into the end credits for an awesome additional scene)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H11M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi513124633", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MTAwMzczNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDUxNTk3OQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2MTAwMzczNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDUxNTk3OQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When an alien attack threatens the Earth's existence, giant robots piloted by humans are deployed to fight off the menace.", "uploadDate": "2013-07-03T21:54:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0402271/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlie Hunnam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0402271?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Raleigh Becket"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0252961/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Idris Elba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0252961?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stacker Pentecost"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206359/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charlie Day"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0206359?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. Newton Geiszler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242882/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Max Martini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0242882?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Herc Hansen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004286/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Clifton Collins Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0004286?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ops Tendo Choi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0377034/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brad William Henke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0377034?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Construction Foreman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3870544/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mana Ashida"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm3870544?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young Mako"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0684187/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Joe Pingue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0684187?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Captain Merrit"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1459109/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Diego Klattenhoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm1459109?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Yancy Becket"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0452860/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rinko Kikuchi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0452860?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mako Mori"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1218607/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Burn Gorman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm1218607?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Gottlieb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2059117/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Robert Kazinsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm2059117?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Chuck Hansen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000579/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ron Perlman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0000579?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hannibal Chau"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132660/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Larry Joe Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0132660?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Construction Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0782213/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Santiago Segura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1663662/characters/nm0782213?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Wizened Man"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "Mexico", "Hong Kong"], "Language": ["English", "Japanese", "Cantonese", "Mandarin"], "Release Date": ["12 July 2013 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Still Seas"], "Filming Locations": ["Pinewood Toronto Studios, Port Lands, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"], "Budget": ["$190,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$37,285,325,", "14 July 2013"], "Gross USA": ["$101,802,906"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$411,002,906"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Legendary Entertainment", "Double Dare You (DDY)"], "Runtime": ["131 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Datasat", "SDDS", "Dolby Atmos", "Dolby Surround 7.1"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

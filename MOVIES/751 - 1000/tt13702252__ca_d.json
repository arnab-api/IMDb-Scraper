This one belongs to the long long list of those LA HAINE or MA CITE VA CRAQUER rip-offs. I did not expect much. But I tried anyway. And don't regret it. The most powerful sequence was for me when, in the last episode two of the hoodlums go to kill one of their opponents and proceed like real pros. They put some band aids around their wrists before the killing so that no powder residue remains later, no clue. They proceed so rapidly in a very accurate and so fast movements Like, they behave like real pros, and I admire that. That's for me a good series.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1219805209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q5MWJiYTItZDY5ZC00NjNiLWFiMWYtMmY0ZjY4NTZhNWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q5MWJiYTItZDY5ZC00NjNiLWFiMWYtMmY0ZjY4NTZhNWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Franck, a music video director, infiltrates a rough neighbourhood in the South of France to film Tony, a charismatic but unpredictable drug gang leader wanting to break into the rap music scene.

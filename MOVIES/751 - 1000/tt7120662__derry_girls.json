As anybody in the UK or Ireland would guess this follows a group of Catholic girls in the city of Derry in Northern Ireland (had they been protestant it would no doubt have been called 'Londonderry Girls). The humour is such that people of whatever persuasion are likely to find it equally funny/offensive. \n\nThe girls who attend an all-girls school are Erin, Orla, Clare and Michelle; in the first episode they are joined by Michelle's English cousin James who ends up going to the girls' school as it is feared he wouldn't survive at a boys' school. Over the course of the six episodes of the first season they get up to various amusing situations; James trying to find somewhere to go to the toilet in a girls' school; witnessing a possible miracle, which one of them knows was far from miraculous, getting stuck in the middle of an Orange Parade, and looking after visiting teenagers from Chernobyl amongst others. \n\nI feel this may be a very Marmite series; viewers will either love it or hate it and few are likely to be merely indifferent. Yes, it is puerile at times but it was done in a way that I found hilarious. The characters, both young and old, are all pretty funny with the cast doing a great job making them believable even when the situation gets comically exaggerated. While we do see evidence of The Troubles for the most part it remains in the background as the characters get on with their lives as though such things were perfectly normal. Overall I'd say that this certainly won't be for everybody but if you want a good laugh and aren't easily offend it I'd recommend giving it a go... I can't wait for the promised series two.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 1 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2569583129", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVhODJiNDctOWYxNy00NzhjLWI1NGUtMWNkNGU0M2U4ZDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVhODJiNDctOWYxNy00NzhjLWI1NGUtMWNkNGU0M2U4ZDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg", "description": "Amid the political conflict of Northern Ireland in the 1990s, five high school students square off with the universal challenges of being a teenager.", "uploadDate": "2019-01-04T01:28:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8090765/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Saoirse-Monica Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm8090765?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Erin Quinn"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1965552/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nicola Coughlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm1965552?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Clare Devlin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3780043/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dylan Llewellyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm3780043?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "James Maguire"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164845/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kathy Kiera Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm0164845?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sarah McCool"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0568400/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ian McElhinney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm0568400?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joe McCool"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2392703/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Leah O'Rourke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm2392703?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jenny Joyce"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5251791/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Claire Rafferty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm5251791?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Miss Mooney"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5308665/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Louisa Harland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm5308665?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Orla McCool"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5324035/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jamie-Lee O'Donnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm5324035?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michelle Mallon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642321/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tara Lynne O'Neill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm0642321?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mary Quinn"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0862916/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tommy Tiernan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm0862916?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gerry Quinn"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2836709/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Siobhan McSweeney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm2836709?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sister Michael"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5637047/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Beccy Henderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm5637047?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Aisling"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0189709/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Amelia Crowley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7120662/characters/nm0189709?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Deirdre Mallon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["21 December 2018 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Derry Girls"], "Filming Locations": ["Londonderry, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, UK"], "Production Co": ["Hat Trick Productions"], "Runtime": ["30 min"]}}

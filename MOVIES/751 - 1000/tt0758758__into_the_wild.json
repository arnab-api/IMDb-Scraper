I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.\n\nThis is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.\n\nThe feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.\n\nWhat it reminded me of...\n\n\n* Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold & Maude...) - even a bit of Ken Loach\n\n\n\n* Ruby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider\n\n\n... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was \"too long\" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.\n\nHal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.\n\nThe film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed.

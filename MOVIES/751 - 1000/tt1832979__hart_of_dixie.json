All the characters are trying to find their way in life and often make mistakes due to their insecurities or conceptions of what they are supposed to be (Lemon tries to be the perfect southern belle, Zoe tries to live up to what she thinks her parents want her to be ). I love seeing the variety of ages going through life issues such as seeing Zoe finally realizes that her mom really did try to do what she thought was best for her but has errors in judgment. The scenes between Zoe and her father Ethan hart show his concern for her and insecurities about his place as her father . I love how Wade is always concerned about Zoe but is totally immature and can't admit he loves her. He works to keep up his front that he doesn't care because he is insecure about how people see him as second rate. It is fun and charming. Rachel Bilson is a great Zoe! She is funny and sensitive and a good person..and has her flaws it is ..refreshing. The heat wave episode was hilarious. The dynamic between wade and Zoe makes the show. I am tired of everyone blaming Zoe for ruining this and that..that is getting old. I hope the new shows in 2013 continue to evolve the richness of the characters along with the the humor and southern charm! I'd love to see more of AnnaBeth and see Wade realize his potential.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hart Of Dixie", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2390932761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2U5M2VlNzYtZGExOS00NzhjLTk1NzMtOTIzYTkwZjNkMDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Hart Of Dixie", "uploadDate": "2019-03-17T23:41:52Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1377375/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rachel Bilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm1377375?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Zoe Hart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "76 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930317/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cress Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm0930317?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lavon Hayes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "76 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2187603/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Scott Porter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm2187603?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "George Tucker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "76 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2845866/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kaitlyn Black"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm2845866?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "AnnaBeth Nass"}, {"url": "#", "name": "63 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3725383/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mallory Moye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm3725383?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Wanda"}, {"url": "#", "name": "53 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2259835/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brandi Burkhardt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm2259835?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Crickett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0454809/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jaime King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm0454809?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lemon Breeland"}, {"url": "#", "name": "76 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1569067/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wilson Bethel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm1569067?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wade Kinsella"}, {"url": "#", "name": "76 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001513/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tim Matheson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm0001513?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dr. Brick Breeland"}, {"url": "#", "name": "70 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4103005/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ross Philips"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm4103005?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tom Long"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001817/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Reginald VelJohnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1832979/characters/nm0001817?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dash DeWitt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "52 episodes, 2011-2015"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["26 September 2011 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Hart of Dixie"], "Filming Locations": ["Burbank, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Fake Empire", "CBS Television Studios", "Warner Bros.

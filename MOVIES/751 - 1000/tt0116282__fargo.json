In what way?\"  \"Just a general way.\"  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coen's finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation  with Gaear and the wood-chipper.  Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H.  Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, \"He's fleeing  the interview!\"  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudr\u00fcd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.  If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent  life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you."}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fargo", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2228618777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmExN2VjZTMtMzhlNi00NDRiLWE0YzAtNDFiNjc2ZTUyZTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmExN2VjZTMtMzhlNi00NDRiLWE0YzAtNDFiNjc2ZTUyZTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Fargo Only Be version", "uploadDate": "2010-08-17T03:17:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000513/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William H.

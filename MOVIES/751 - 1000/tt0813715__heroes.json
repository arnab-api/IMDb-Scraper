And now that I've tuned in I'm hooked. The premise of super-humans has been done before and most recently in Mutant X. And I've been around to check these shows out. The misfit one with Courtney Cox was an old favorite. But none of these shows garnished the pure mystery that Heroes had going for it all the way to the end of the pilot. Plus a killer cast should make it a surefire hit.\n\nI've loved Adrian Pasdar since he chewed up the screen in Profit and while he seems to be playing a similar role here, he is balanced by Milo Ventimigilia as his kid brother with a more human heart and dreams he can fly.\n\nBut the real scene stealing of the show belongs to the ladies. Ali Larter creates a believable single mother with serious money problems. Her strange gift is actual scary and has yet to have been fleshed out. The sequence where she awakes to find things have gone horribly wrong in her favor are chill inducing.\n\nAnd on the flip side Hayden Panettiere's discovery of her gift is grueling, bloody, and refreshingly ironic as a modern day Supergirl. All her stunt work in a cheerleader's outfit made me smile. And by the show's end a revelation comes about her family life that made the show even more interesting.\n\nWith a painter who creates art that sees into the future and a comedic turn by Masi Oka and his abilities it's hard not to enjoy heroes. It twists and turns in only an hour and keeps you grounded to the characters and the situations they fall into. The previews for upcoming episodes made me actually want more. If your not tuning in on Monday nights, you might be missing something spectacular.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Heroes: Season 4", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1264035865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTUzYmIyM2YtMTdmOS00YmYzLTg5NjYtODJiMTA5M2M0ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTUzYmIyM2YtMTdmOS00YmYzLTg5NjYtODJiMTA5M2M0ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Heroes: Season 4", "uploadDate": "2014-01-03T07:32:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0171059/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack Coleman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0171059?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Noah Bennet"}, {"url": "#", "name": "73 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0893257/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Milo Ventimiglia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0893257?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter Petrelli"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0707983/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sendhil Ramamurthy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0707983?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mohinder Suresh"}, {"url": "#", "name": "63 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1645304/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "James Kyson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm1645304?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ando Masahashi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0704270/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Zachary Quinto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0704270?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sylar"}, {"url": "#", "name": "59 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004284/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cristine Rose"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0004284?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Angela Petrelli"}, {"url": "#", "name": "52 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1097515/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jimmy Jean-Louis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm1097515?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "The Haitian"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0659363/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hayden Panettiere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0659363?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Claire Bennet"}, {"url": "#", "name": "73 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1199811/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Masi Oka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm1199811?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hiro Nakamura"}, {"url": "#", "name": "65 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342399/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Greg Grunberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0342399?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Matt Parkman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "63 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0664499/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Adrian Pasdar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0664499?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nathan Petrelli"}, {"url": "#", "name": "60 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005123/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ali Larter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0005123?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Niki Sanders"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0189524/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ashley Crow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0813715/characters/nm0189524?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sandra Bennet"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Japanese", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["25 September 2006 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Heroes"], "Filming Locations": ["Golden Valley High School, Santa Clarita, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Tailwind Productions", "NBC Universal Television", "Universal Media Studios (UMS)"], "Runtime": ["45 min", "60 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

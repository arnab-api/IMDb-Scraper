I can totally understand where they are coming from.  I play the game of hockey, and I find it hard to believe that every time a player touches the ice, he's scoring goals.  Added to that, how he learns to fight, and works out for a week, and all of a sudden beats up a guy that kicked his butt a couple of weeks before.  BUT.... You also have to understand something else. Since Slap Shot, an undoubtedly awesome classic to all hockey fans around the world, there had not been an attempt at a movie that mainly focused on hockey.  The makers of this movie had to be creative to attract attention for the sport.  For example, the stick fight, the constant beautiful goals, the way he won the fight.  It had some reality to it like the jokes played on the rookie in the bar and when they shave him, you know, down there. The way he was put up in someones house.  The most impressive thing about the movie, was the beginning and how it set up the rest of the movie.  It starts with a home video of Dean(Rob Lowe) when he was very young playing with his older brother and their friends.  It shows how clearly dominant he was and that leads into the present time with him saying, \"I've been offered a tryout with the Hamilton Mustangs.\"   And to Canadians who feel like this movie disrespected your great sport (yes, i mean GREAT sport), remember this.  When they are on their way to Canada, Deans older brother who is driving him says you are gonna have to learn, \"Oh, Canada\" and also when Dean says, \"They'll never catch me\" showing cockiness like he's superior to anyone in the league, his brother says, \"Oh, they'll catch you.\"  I love hockey, I loved this movie.  Did it have it's flaws?  Yeah, plenty of them. But if you're looking for an inspiring, action filled drama, give this movie a whirl."}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2304228889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM1ZWNmZDUtNDQ4OC00ZGZjLThmYjctNjgwNDJmYThhOWJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDM1ZWNmZDUtNDQ4OC00ZGZjLThmYjctNjgwNDJmYThhOWJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A 17 year old farm boy is offered an ice hockey tryout.

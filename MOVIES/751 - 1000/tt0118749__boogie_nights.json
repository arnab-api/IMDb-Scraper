The only thing I had heard about it was that my sister-in-law told us not to see it because it was bawdy and she walked out, so right away I knew it was worth watching. This movie was nothing like we thought it was going to be like--it was a fantastic and quite involving drama, which deserved a few Oscars. The time frames from the early 70's to the mid 80's were flawless, and the \"glamor\" of the porn industry was effectively dispelled by the portrayal of the stars. One of the most memorable scenes of all times, in my opinion was the drug deal gone bad, the firecrackers, the guy in the bathrobe and the utter uneasiness of the deposed porn stars as we listened to \"Jessie's Girl\" and \"Sister Christian\". Burt Reynolds was great as Jack Horner, the director who made money with young energy and the coming trends, but realized he had to be \"father\" to all those aging stars who had nowhere else to go once the bright lights began to flicker and the money was getting thin.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2797386265", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWMwZWU0OTMtMjY3Yi00Nzg5LWE5YmUtZTdmNjliZGY2ZDMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWMwZWU0OTMtMjY3Yi00Nzg5LWE5YmUtZTdmNjliZGY2ZDMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-09-28T23:04:49Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0350079/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Luis Guzm\u00e1n"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118749/characters/nm0350079?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maurice t.t.

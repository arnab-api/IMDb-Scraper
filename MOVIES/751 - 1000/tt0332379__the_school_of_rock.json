One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn't pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars, which doesn't go very well, the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly, who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast, Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade ( or something like that ) class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. \n\nSchool Of Rock is a great feel-good comedy, fun for just about anyone of any age, kids or adults. Jack Black does carry a lot of this film on his own but I won't be too harsh on the kids in the movie, they did very well also. If anyone else should play Dewey Finn rather than Jack, it just wouldn't be the same. Since Jack is actually in a rock band in real life, and has played a few characters in films before who are also into music, he just seemed to fit right into this film. His real passion for rock music helps a lot in this film, and makes Dewey Finn one hell of a good character. The plot to this film is really good I think and Mike White did a great job on the screenplay. As did Linklater on the direction of the film.\n\nThis comedy should not be ignored just because there are kids in it, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot and you probably will too. \n\n9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The School of Rock", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3338207513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVjMGJiMmMtZjcwOC00MzM0LWE5NTctMzIwYThlNjJmYzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVjMGJiMmMtZjcwOC00MzM0LWE5NTctMzIwYThlNjJmYzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:09:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0085312/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack Black"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm0085312?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dewey Finn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1306097/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lucas Papaelias"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1306097?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Neil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0798971/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sarah Silverman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm0798971?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patty Di Marco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0044974/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lucas Babin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm0044974?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Spider"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440137/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jordan-Claire Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1440137?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michelle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1388927/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Miranda Cosgrove"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1388927?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Summer Hathaway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440138/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Robert Tsai"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1440138?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lawrence"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1333511/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kevin Alexander Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1333511?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Freddy Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0664238/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Adam Pascal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm0664238?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Theo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1083114/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chris Stack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1083114?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Doug"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0925234/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mike White"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm0925234?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ned Schneebly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000349/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joan Cusack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm0000349?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rosalie Mullins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440136/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Veronica Afflerbach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1440136?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Eleni"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1417621/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joey Gaydos Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1417621?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Zack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1208741/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Angelo Massagli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0332379/characters/nm1208741?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Frankie"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "Germany"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["3 October 2003 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["School of Rock"], "Filming Locations": ["New York City, New York, USA"], "Budget": ["$35,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$19,622,714,", "5 October 2003"], "Gross USA": ["$81,261,177"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$131,095,990"], "Production Co": ["Paramount Pictures", "Scott Rudin Productions", "MFP Munich Film Partners GmbH & Company I.

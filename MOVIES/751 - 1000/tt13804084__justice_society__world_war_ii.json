Nazi magic items, where? Flash's role was important when? If anything he made himself and Garrick weaker most of the movie. Why were nazis even apart of this film? Only for the Atlantans to be the big bad in the end. I really hope this is a stand alone and if that's the case it makes this film that much worse because plots were essentially set up to never be established. Iris west, are we really gonna canonize this tokenized Iris West? Shes not black and you don't need to put a black face on established characters of any other race. If you want black characters then just make them and make them likable as you would any other mainstream hero, but then again considering how bad this film was if they did that, the character would be atrocious.\n\nWhat I did like was the animation, it wasn't great but it was different. The fighting was decent too.

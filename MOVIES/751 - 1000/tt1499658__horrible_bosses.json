Jason Bateman again showing the world he can act and telling his critics to go swivel on his middle finger by how great he was in horrible bosses.\n\nI personally rated every single actor in this film as Grade A , the acting was just superb! If you want a good laugh and a good night out go and see horrible bosses , best 8 pounds 50 I've ever spent! Oh on a side note , something totally off topic! As the film ended in the cinema i got up and went down the stairs leading out of the cinema , i looked back for my mate who was taking his time , and everyone was still sat down watching the blooper reel , when it ended everyone saw me alone at the bottom of the stairs noticed my T-SHIRT and i quote my T-SHIRT SAYS! FAT PEOPLE ARE HARD TO KIDNAP.\n\nEntire cinema laughed! :) Great day Great Film , Great Audience.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Horrible Bosses: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4000947481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk1MjIwOTQ5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzk1MjIwOTQ5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjYyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Three friends conspire to murder their awful bosses when they realize they are standing in the way of their happiness.", "uploadDate": "2011-05-14T10:07:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000867/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jason Bateman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0000867?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nick Hendricks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000228/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin Spacey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0000228?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dave Harken"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005441/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lindsay Sloane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0005441?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stacy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000098/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jennifer Aniston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0000098?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1859626/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jennifer Hasty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm1859626?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kurt's Co-Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1197104/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "George Back"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm1197104?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kurt's Co-Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1620783/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Meghan Markle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm1620783?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jamie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3080438/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Celia Finkelstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm3080438?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Margie Emerman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2528248/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Steve Wiebe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm2528248?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Thomas, Head of Security"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206359/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Charlie Day"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0206359?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dale Arbus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003320/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Albala"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0003320?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Anderton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0837177/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jason Sudeikis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0837177?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kurt Buckman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0050659/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Reginald Ballard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0050659?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kurt's Co-Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0515225/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Barry Livingston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0515225?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kurt's Co-Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000661/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Donald Sutherland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1499658/characters/nm0000661?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jack Pellit"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["8 July 2011 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Horrible Bosses"], "Filming Locations": ["2059 East 7th Street, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$35,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$28,302,165,", "10 July 2011"], "Gross USA": ["$117,538,559"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$209,838,559"], "Production Co": ["New Line Cinema", "Rat Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["98 min", "106 min", "(extended cut)"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "SDDS", "Datasat"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39:1"]}}

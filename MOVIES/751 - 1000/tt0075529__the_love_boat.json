I used to watch it frequently when I was younger and I always enjoyed it. A great TV show and even unique. After all, this show takes place mostly in a cruise liner, where its passengers and crew live romances and adventures.\n\n\"The Love Boat\" usually took place in the liner \"Pacific Princess\", but other alternative yet similar ships were used as well. That was the case of the \"Island Princess\", the \"Stella Solaris\", the \"Pearl of Scandinavia\", the \"Royal Viking Sky\" and the \"Royal Princess\".\n\nThis is a charming TV series which is also famous for its timeless and wonderful opening song, \"The Love Boat\".\n\nEven though this TV series was very popular in its time, it seems to me that it has become forgotten and much less popular as the years go by. Besides, it seems to be largely unknown in our generation, a generation with eyes mostly for uninteresting, mediocre and crappy TV shows. However, for those who knew \"The Love Boat\", it remains alive in their memories and won't be forgotten."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0533891/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gavin MacLeod"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075529/characters/nm0533891?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain Merrill Stubing"}, {"url": "#", "name": "250 episodes, 1977-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0486198/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ted Lange"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075529/characters/nm0486198?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bartender Isaac Washington"}, {"url": "#", "name": "250 episodes, 1977-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0856708/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lauren Tewes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075529/characters/nm0856708?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cruise Director Julie McCoy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "199 episodes, 1977-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0465728/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bernie Kopell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075529/characters/nm0465728?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Doctor Adam Bricker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "250 episodes, 1977-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0334948/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Fred Grandy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075529/characters/nm0334948?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ship's Purser 'Gopher' Smith"}, {"url": "#", "name": "246 episodes, 1977-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0924038/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jill Whelan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075529/characters/nm0924038?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Vicki Stubing"}, {"url": "#", "name": "190 episodes, 1978-1987"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["5 May 1977 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Love Boat"], "Filming Locations": ["20th Century Fox Studios - 10201 Pico Blvd., Century City, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Aaron Spelling Productions", "Douglas S.

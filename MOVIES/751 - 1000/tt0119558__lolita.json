Upon hearing that there was a movie adapted from the novel (I am of a younger generation) I found it hard to believe that anyone could put into visual images and dialogue what had appeared in my mind as flawless. After seeing this remade version, I came away satisfied.  Hearing what countless critics had to say has never changed my view.  Of course, it can never come even close to the novel, but watching Lyne's version unfold in quiet and somber light brought to mind the exact same feelings I was experiencing reading the book. Certain things did bother me.  Lolita's mother in particular.  Hearing Melanie Griffith deliver lines as if she were reading to a group of school children set my teeth on edge, although she went down in fine style.  And having the sole reason for Humbert's obsession with nymphets wrapped up in one neat reason(Annabel) was also hard to swallow. But Dominique Swain was nearly the perfect picture of the Lolita in my mind. Wistful, vulnerable, and a fierce manipulator all at once, it's hard to believe she'd never had acting experience beforehand.  Perhaps a bit too old in certain lights, she still managed to carry off a difficult role and steal every scene she was in, much like Natalie Portman in \"Beautiful Girls\". Certain expressions were incredibly poignant. (Think of Lo's face when Humbert denied permission to be in the play.  Think of her lipstick smeared smile after being caught going out when Humbert went to the market). The essence of this movie is what formed my opinion that this was a good film.  The pacing, the comparison to Kubrick didn't matter when the mood of the entire film was left. Maybe the critics are right, and I'm missing something.  But when the final scene appeared, that dreamy image of Lolita's face, I was completely satisfied that Lyne did the best job anyone could have."}, "duration": "PT2H17M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lolita (1997)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi883622169", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZhMTJiNDQtMjk1Ni00MjhiLWI3NmQtYmU4YTA5NTkzMWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZhMTJiNDQtMjk1Ni00MjhiLWI3NmQtYmU4YTA5NTkzMWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Trimark", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:20:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000460/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeremy Irons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119558/characters/nm0000460?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Humbert Humbert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001449/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Frank Langella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119558/characters/nm0001449?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Clare Quilty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0791877/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Suzanne Shepherd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119558/characters/nm0791877?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Miss Pratt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212767/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Erin J.

Using this; as a way of dealing with her emotional collapse, in return for providing for the family by dealing marijuana to neighbours and spacey school-kids. Nancy is played with perfect pokerfaced- untelling-drug-seller mum by Mary-Louise Parker, ex-West Wing star who talks on a less political and more social tasks of day to day life. She is groomed for any social eventuality. Alongside the mum of two is youngest Shane (Alexander Gould) who played the voice of Nemo in 'Finding Nemo' who is less stutter and more into the wild flights of fancy. Older bro Silas (Hunter Parrish) who is eager to get his school life on the OC-type list by doing anything or anyone possible. \n\nYes, selling drugs makes good TV? Weeds outshines the morally ambiguous judgement on drugs. Some of the people who do drugs are good, some are bad. But it's the person we judge, not the substance. While it seems a bit Desperate Housewives, it's got a lot more going for it. With bitchy neighbour Elizabeth Perkins who makes the typical rich mum attitude take a leap forward. \n\nVerdict: \n\nWith its entwined spontaneity, this is addictive and yet bizarrely enjoyable. Like most TV shows trying today: firmly planted in reality."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Weeds: Season Eight", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1116841497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjViZjJhNzItNzViMS00MzBmLWI0YzUtYzlmZWQ2MjU5MzljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjViZjJhNzItNzViMS00MzBmLWI0YzUtYzlmZWQ2MjU5MzljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Weeds: Season Eight", "uploadDate": "2013-03-15T03:37:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000571/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mary-Louise Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm0000571?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nancy Botwin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "102 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1071252/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alexander Gould"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm1071252?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Shane Botwin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "102 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005095/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Justin Kirk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm0005095?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Andy Botwin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "99 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0586994/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Andy Milder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm0586994?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dean Hodes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0665256/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tonye Patano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm0665256?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Heylia James"}, {"url": "#", "name": "41 episodes, 2005-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1446060/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hunter Parrish"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm1446060?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Silas Botwin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "102 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005265/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kevin Nealon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm0005265?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Doug Wilson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "102 episodes, 2005-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001610/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Elizabeth Perkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm0001610?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Celia Hodes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "63 episodes, 2005-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1872782/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Allie Grant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0439100/characters/nm1872782?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Isabelle Hodes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "57 episodes, 2005-2009"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["7 August 2005 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Weeds"], "Filming Locations": ["26885 Chaucer Pl, Stevenson Ranch, California, USA"], "Budget": ["$3,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Production Co": ["Lions Gate Television", "Tilted Productions", "Weeds Productions"], "Runtime": ["28 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

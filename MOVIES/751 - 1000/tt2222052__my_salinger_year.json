Salinger's work, aspiring writers, or some combination of all the above. Who can say - but it seems clear from seeing it just now (on its U.S. release) that it's a movie not principally concerned about those other things, but rather about its own central character, Joana Rakoff (as played by Margaret Qualley). It is, after all, *Joanna's* Salinger Year - not those other folks'; it's concerned with her *experience* of those things - not the things themselves. I find the movie to be highly underrated; indeed, it's got a few really standout moments (mostly things that play out in the confines of Joanna's mind) - as well as some good, solid performances. If you take it purely as a story of personal growth and development, *set against* the backdrop of the NY literary world, I think you'll enjoy it, as I did. It's \"subtle,\" to be sure - but who needs sledgehammers?

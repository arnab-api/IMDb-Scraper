Although not quite as good as \"Dances With Wolves\" Open Range, funnily enough, not only stars Kevin Costner but is along the same theme in as much as it tells a story about the early American way of life. This time about the \"Free Range\" cattlemen and the different hardships they had to cope with. And for once my family could sit down and watch a movie without all the smut, swearing and extreme violence that unfortunately, all movie makers of late, seem to think is necessary to sell them. The storyline was simple and easy to follow at the same time as it retold a fine piece of early American history. \n\nAlthough the actors had a simple storyline to work with, I felt their performances made the movie all the more realistic. Kevin Costner in my opinion is a fine actor, but put him in with an under-rated master such as Robert Duvall, and you can't go wrong. Their easy going,straight from the hip portrayal of the main characters was one of the reasons that as soon as I had finished watching the video I rewound it and the whole family watched it again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H19M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000380/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Duvall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0000380?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Boss Spearman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000906/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Annette Bening"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0000906?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sue Barlow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005052/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael Jeter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0005052?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Percy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0751638/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "James Russo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0751638?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sheriff Poole"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0567506/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dean McDermott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0567506?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Doc Barlow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1423771/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Herb Kohler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm1423771?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cafe Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0766761/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cliff Saunders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0766761?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ralph"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0724995/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Julian Richings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0724995?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Wylie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000126/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kevin Costner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0000126?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Charley Waite"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002091/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michael Gambon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0002091?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Denton Baxter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0526019/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Diego Luna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0526019?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Button"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0072344/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Abraham Benrubi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0072344?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167649/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kim Coates"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0167649?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Butler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534132/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Peter MacNeill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm0534132?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1297495/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Patricia Stutz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0316356/characters/nm1297495?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ralph's Wife"}]}]}

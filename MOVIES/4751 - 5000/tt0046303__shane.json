It tells its story visually, through subtext, and creates a realistic portrait of people; it is also emotionally and morally complex.  It is never stated that Shane had been a gunfighter; we just understand this, from his appearance and from what we glean through the dialogue.  Likewise, there are no overt moments of intimacy between Shane and Marion (Mrs. Starrett), but we are aware that there is a deep attraction between them.  When Joe, Marian's husband, realizes it, it is not because of anything he states, just a line at the 4th of July party, when Marian (in her wedding dress) is dancing with Shane:  \"Looks like I'm fenced out,\" and what is spoken as a joke becomes serious as we watch the expression on his face.  The closest he comes to actually saying anything is toward the end, when he's going to ride into town to face Ryker, and tells Marian that if anything happens to him he knows she'll be taken care of.  Likewise, at the end of the film, when little Joey is calling across the plains for Shane to \"come back,\" he yells to Shane, \"Mother wants you, I know she does,\" and the words echo back, we see a close up of Joey, his expression changing, and we know the child realizes too that Shane does (or could) mean something more to his mother.\n\nStevens also didn't make the \"bad guys\" black-and-white villains.  We understand that these men fought and tamed the land and are now being displaced by the homesteaders.  What they want might not be fair, but it is not completely unreasonable either.\n\nMost of the scenes, even the simple ones, play in montage.  It looks as though Stevens shot each scene from about 15 different angles and edited them together.  The effect is striking.\n\nFar and away one of the best films ever.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3581066777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmEzZDI4MTEtOTkwMS00OTE0LWJkYTctOGVkNTAxNThhMGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmEzZDI4MTEtOTkwMS00OTE0LWJkYTctOGVkNTAxNThhMGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-20T17:04:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000042/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alan Ladd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0000042?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Shane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001336/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Van Heflin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0001336?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joe Starrett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001588/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jack Palance"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0001588?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jack Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0118000/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Edgar Buchanan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0118000?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Fred Lewis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176879/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Elisha Cook Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0176879?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stonewall Torrey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226109/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John Dierkes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0226109?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Morgan Ryker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0574707/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Paul McVey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0574707?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sam Grafton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0263330/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Edith Evanson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0263330?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Shipstead"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000795/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jean Arthur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0000795?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marian Starrett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001121/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brandon De Wilde"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0001121?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joey Starrett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424565/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ben Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0424565?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chris Calloway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0583093/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Emile Meyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0583093?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rufus Ryker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0817930/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Douglas Spencer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0817930?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Axel 'Swede' Shipstead"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179289/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ellen Corby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm0179289?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mrs. Liz Torrey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1547109/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046303/characters/nm1547109?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Will Atkey - Bartender"}]}]}

It's a standard three act structure here where the first hour establishes the strong family bonds between Mother (Kim Hye-Ja) and child Yoon Do-Joon (Won Bin), bordering quite close to being incestuous (but this is glossed over since we're dealing with a man-child here), before they key murder scene beocmes the catalyst for Mother to do some serious investigations work in order to prove her son's innocence, given that the perverted justice system provided that bad after-taste.\n\nI particularly enjoyed the epilogue, which ties in with the inexplicable opening credits which made more sense once you've come full circle at the end. It's the classic mantra of two wrongs never making one right, and how in the protection of loved ones, one will resort to extreme measures that blind common, good sense, and become a \"rather you than me\" syndrome, which I believe every one of us are capable of if we find ourselves pushed to a corner with no where to run. Bong Joon-Ho is again at his element in unravelling the investigations process, which ties in black comedy with painful, dramatic moments, being evenly paced with heightened tension at appropriate moments.\n\nAnd kudos of course must go to actress Kim Hye-Ja, who almost single-handedly carried the film on her own, since Won Bin disappears mid-way through. Her single mom, with so much affection for her son, just dazzles and makes it convincing that she's been that single pillar of strength and shelter for her son when he gets up to shenanigans brought about by no good company of his. It's not the first time Do-Joon got himself into a fix, given the strange mannerisms he's been taught to try and jog his memory, and Won Bin showcases his acting chops as the dim-witted boy whose disability gets frequently exploited, coming off as endearing at times, so much so that you're quick to judge and side with him as a victim of circumstances, being at the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nMother is definitely recommended stuff, especially if you're a Bong Joon-Ho fan as he delivers yet another powerful film that will leave plenty of post-screening discussion.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H9M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mother: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3905684505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMDM0MzEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM1NjQxMw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMDM0MzEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM1NjQxMw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A mother desperately searches for the killer who framed her son for their horrific murder.", "uploadDate": "2010-01-26T10:16:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1067547/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hye-ja Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm1067547?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1918588/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jin Goo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm1918588?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jin-tae"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0432429/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mi-seon Jeon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm0432429?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mi-sun"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3747110/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Yeong-seok Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm3747110?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Junk Shop Elder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3825915/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Woo-hee Chun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm3825915?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mi-na"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3674332/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Moo-yeong Yeo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm3674332?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lawyer Kong Seok-ho"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3242530/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Go Gyu-Pil"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm3242530?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ddung-ddung"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1696158/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jin-gu Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm1696158?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ah-jeong's Grandma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1047193/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Won Bin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm1047193?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Yoon Do-joon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2175143/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Je-mun Yun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm2175143?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Je-moon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3827087/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sae-byeok Song"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm3827087?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sepaktakraw Detective"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3832104/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hee-ra Mun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm3832104?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Moon Ah-jeong"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3826489/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Byoung-Soon Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm3826489?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Group Leader"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2600104/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Yeong-gi Jeong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm2600104?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kkang-ma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3011544/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mi-do Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1216496/characters/nm3011544?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hyung-teo"}]}]}

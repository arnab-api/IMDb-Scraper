One wrong choice whilst playing the game could result in very bad consequences for the character you're playing as, so throughout the game your quite tense to try and keep everyone alive.\n\nThe characters are all so unique and fun to play; they're all androids but they all have different personalities which you instantly connect to. It's also great to see how their individual stories intertwine with one another, from start to finish instead of just at the end. \n\nThe quick-time events are so tense and constantly keep you on the edge of your seat, and the action sequences are beautiful, along with the movement of the characters and the scenery; the graphics are just breath-taking.\n\nFinally, the stories of Connor, Kara and Markus are so fun and interesting to play; they all have unique paths and you can meet so many characters along the way (these characters will create individual relationships with other characters too which is exciting, as everyone has different opinions and thoughts about certain things that happen in the game, so you have to choose who to agree with). The acting is also very good, as the actors/ actresses make you fall in love with their character and want to fight for them and in a way, protect them.\n\nThere are so many aspects of this game that make it so astoundingly beautiful and one to remember, and I'd 100% recommend it to anyone thinking about buying it, or just anyone in general.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Detroit: Become Human (VG)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4052990745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWM5OGMyNzEtMzBmMS00ZDQzLWIzNGEtNDMzZmE0Nzg1YTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWM5OGMyNzEtMzBmMS00ZDQzLWIzNGEtNDMzZmE0Nzg1YTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Launch Trailer", "uploadDate": "2018-05-31T17:05:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2038170/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Valorie Curry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm2038170?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930898/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jesse Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm0930898?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Markus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000317/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Clancy Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm0000317?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hank Anderson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000448/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lance Henriksen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm0000448?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carl Manfred"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0451078/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Simbi Kali"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm0451078?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amanda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1758026/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ben Lambert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm1758026?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Simon"}, {"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm1758026?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Daniel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4158239/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dana Gourrier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm4158239?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rose Chapman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2742541/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Barry Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm2742541?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jeffrey Fowler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3260379/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bryan Dechart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm3260379?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Connor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9861590/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Audrey Boustani"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm9861590?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0661992/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Evan Parke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm0661992?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Luther"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1310368/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Minka Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm1310368?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "North"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4554036/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Parker Sawyers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm4554036?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Josh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0627667/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Neil Newbon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm0627667?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Elijah Kamski"}, {"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm0627667?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gavin Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0332363/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Dominic Gould"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5158314/characters/nm0332363?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Todd Williams"}]}]}

Based on the blog and subsequent novel by the mysterious Belle de Jour, this is an insight into the life of a high-end call girl who turns normal prostitute stereotypes on their head. Annoyingly, the production has a slightly soft focus sheen which gives it a somewhat abstract (and low budget) feel. Visualise an '80s pop promo and you'll know what I mean!\n\nIt's only a matter of minutes before the first episode kicks into gear with Piper delivering energetic, simulated fellatio on a gawping customer. For British television, this is no-holds-barred stuff with \"F\" and \"C\" words, and relatively graphic imagery at every turn. I was pleasantly surprised at the bravery of this drama - it doesn't disappoint but despite the sexual gymnastics on display, the series lacks any real erotic content. It has the substance of a late-night MTV video.\n\nPiper herself delivers a great performance. She's as likable as always as both Hannah and her late-night alter ego and she makes the most of the relatively light material contained within the script.\n\nThe beautiful Cherie Lunghi plays Piper's agent, Stephanie, a no-nonsense, straight-talking businesswoman. Marvellous stuff.\n\n8 out of 10. With this series, Piper has shrugged off the shadow of \"Doctor Who\"'s Rose and entered a whole new territory. Without a doubt, she's an actress that will continue to enjoy success in the fields of television and cinema."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3037380121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNlZTczZWItMTMxYi00MDA4LTk0OTEtMWZiNDM5YjU1ZmE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNlZTczZWItMTMxYi00MDA4LTk0OTEtMWZiNDM5YjU1ZmE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Based on the popular diary of the anonymous sex worker known only as Belle de Jour.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-13T10:48:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0684877/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Billie Piper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1000734/characters/nm0684877?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Belle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 2007-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0526724/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cherie Lunghi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1000734/characters/nm0526724?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stephanie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "15 episodes, 2007-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0325221/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Iddo Goldberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1000734/characters/nm0325221?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ben"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2007-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534772/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ashley Madekwe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1000734/characters/nm0534772?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bambi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 2008-2010"}]}]}

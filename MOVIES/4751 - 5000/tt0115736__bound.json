Corky is a ex-con who has been hired to decorate the flat next door to Caesar's flat.  When the two meet they slowly begin a love affair behind Caesar's back.  After a while Violet comes up with a plan to steal mob money and frame Caesar for it while she and Corky make off with the cash. However, there is no such thing as a simple plan.\n\nI saw this when it was released in the cinema where the overall view seemed to be of an enjoyable noir thriller with a lesbian twist.  A few years later, the Matrix has made the Wachowski brothers hotter than hot and everyone is clambering all over Bound and building up it's status and pointing to it as a hint of greatness.  Now, after two poor Matrix sequels, many will come back to this film as a sign of their ability before the dollars became more important.  That's the impression I get anyway, from the message boards, reviews and comments from proper critics.  However, I rewatched this and tried to meet it on it's own terms rather than be coloured.\n\nOf itself, it does the business quite effectively as a noir crime thriller. The plot is tough and, although not all that twisty, does easily engage and keep the audience pretty gripped.  The lesbian stuff is done a little cynically I think - where do you draw the line between stuff that is required for us to know that the two are lovers, and the stuff that is titillation? I don't know, the film does it all very tastefully and it is not the film's fault that some sections of the audience will come to this film because it has a lesbian love scene in it.  I acknowledge that it was done quite sexily and was part of the film, but the crime is the focus.\n\nThe brothers direct with great style - set mainly in a couple of flats, the film moves slickly around the place.  Some shoot outs do reveal a style that was later used in the Matrix films (albeit on a sci-fi level).  The slow-mo stuff is pretty good here and not overly used - little tricks like the shooting over the white paint added to the style of the film no end. Despite being bogged down in a story I believe they took too seriously, I don't think they need to prove themselves as directors - their films speak for themselves in that regard, and I do hope they get back in the saddle.\n\nThe cast is deep in talent but mostly they play it in the stereotypical characters of the genre.  Tilly is a great moll, at first she appears to be the delicate flower of the film, but she is as much a femme fatale as Corky. Gershon is very sexy, despite being very glamorous for a supposedly butch ex-con; she plays her role well although I would have liked to see her become more of a fall guy towards the end, in true noir fashion - fooled by love!  Pantoliano is enjoyable; his character may not have a lot of meat on it but Joe does very well with a powerful performance.  Support from Meloni and Ryan is good even if they all fit the gangster clich\u00e9s required by the script.\n\nOverall this is an enjoyable genre film - no more and no less.  The lesbian stuff is a nice twist on the usual formula but it isn't pushed enough to be classed as exploitative (although there's no doubt that the film gained audience as a result of the love scenes).  The cast are good and the direction is stylish, making for a slickly enjoyable noir."}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bound", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2763718937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRhMTk4YWQtNjI5Yi00NmFlLTljYjItMDg0M2Q5NDQzMDFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRhMTk4YWQtNjI5Yi00NmFlLTljYjItMDg0M2Q5NDQzMDFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Bound", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:46:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000236/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jennifer Tilly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115736/characters/nm0000236?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Violet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001592/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joe Pantoliano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115736/characters/nm0001592?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ceasar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005221/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Christopher Meloni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115736/characters/nm0005221?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Johnnie Marzzone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0544721/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Mara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115736/characters/nm0544721?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sue, Bartender"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809213/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Margaret Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115736/characters/nm0809213?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Woman Cop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0046428/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peter Spellos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115736/characters/nm0046428?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lou"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0724656/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kevin Michael Richardson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115736/characters/nm0724656?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cop #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000153/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gina Gershon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0115736/characters/nm0000153?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Corky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0752636/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John P.

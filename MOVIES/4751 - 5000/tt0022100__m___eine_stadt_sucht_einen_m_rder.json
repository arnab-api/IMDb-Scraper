It was a shocking idea for its time, based on the real-life killer Peter Kurten, headlined as the Vampire of D\u00fcsseldorf...\n\n'M' is about a terrorized city, and a plump little man with wide eyes (often chewing candy) who is a pathological child-killer, unable to control his urge for killing... \n\nThe film embodies several Lang themes: the duality between justice and revenge, mob hysteria, the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in, and, for probably the first time in the cinema, it adds a new dimension to suspense: pity... For the killer is clearly mentally sick... He cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease, and yet, we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal, rather than treated as a sick man... \n\nEarly in the film, the killer is heard whistling the Grieg theme from 'In the Hall of the Mountain King'. This theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace... And when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window, the melody on the sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there, just out of sight...\n\nThe Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since 'Casablanca,' 'The Maltese Falcon,' and 'The Mask of Dimitrios.' When the photographs of his victims, all little girls, are shown to him, he jumps back and twitches with horror...\n\nWith powerful visuals, Lang's motion picture is Lorre's first film... His performance as the corpulent, hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion... Lorre is the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes, outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal... He had only twelve lines of dialog...\n\nIn the most famous of all about a pathological killer - Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Anthony Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre, but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy... \n\n'Psycho' reeked with blood and horror, whereas the suspense of 'M' is subtle... A child's balloon without an owner, a rolling ball, are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed... The audience, trapped in its seats, torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer, watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi605863449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzYjRhZGYtYmJiYi00Njg1LWJmOTctOGM0OTcyNTZmOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzYjRhZGYtYmJiYi00Njg1LWJmOTctOGM0OTcyNTZmOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-01T15:11:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000048/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Lorre"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0000048?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hans Beckert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0484737/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Inge Landgut"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0484737?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elsie Beckmann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519765/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Theodor Loos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0519765?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Inspector Groeber"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0323479/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Friedrich Gna\u00df"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0323479?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Franz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447349/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paul Kemp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0447349?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Pickpocket with Six Watches"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0090104/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rudolf Bl\u00fcmner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0090104?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Beckert's Defender"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0825461/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Franz Stein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0825461?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Minister"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0081499/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gerhard Bienert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0081499?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Criminal Secretary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0927145/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ellen Widmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0927145?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Frau Beckmann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0921532/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Otto Wernicke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0921532?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Inspector Karl Lohmann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0345073/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Gustaf Gr\u00fcndgens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0345073?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Schr\u00e4nker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0643997/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Fritz Odemar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0643997?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "The Cheater"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003586/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Theo Lingen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0003586?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bauernf\u00e4nger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0313308/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Georg John"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0313308?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Blind Panhandler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0821504/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ernst Stahl-Nachbaur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0022100/characters/nm0821504?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Police Chief"}]}]}

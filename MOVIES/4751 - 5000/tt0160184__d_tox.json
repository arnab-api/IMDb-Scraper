Actually, while I would never say it's a good movie, it nowhere as bad as you might think - it's certainly better than recent Stallone turkeys like GET CARTER.\n\nIt's actually starts surprisingly well. Not only is Stallone's character given a lot of dialogue, Stallone actually *acts* when delivering it. The subsequent events that traumatize his character are well done, with a genuine eerieness to them. Things continue well for a while longer, showing the utter pit of despair Stallone's character has fallen in, and Stallone once again is up to this challenge.\n\nThen he goes to the detox center, and the movie quickly falls apart. The biggest problems are:\n\n(1) WAY too many characters. It was extremely difficult to remember who was who with all these people walking in and out of the camera. It's also difficult to separate each person in your mind because we hardly learn a thing about each character - if we are lucky.\n\n(2) REALLY bad editing. Scenes (and some individual cuts) go by so quickly that we often don't get the chance to properly digest what we're given to ponder. Two things happening at the same time (in different places) are cut back and forth with no seeming purpose, and no coherent flow. Though the DVD has eight deleted scenes, it's obvious that there was originally a lot more shot. I have to agree with another poster that there are signs there was a desperate effort to save the movie in the editing room.\n\n(3) Once in the detox center, poor Stallone has almost NOTHING to do. He's given almost nothing to say, and frequently sits on the sidelines while things are happening. Not exactly a star vehicle, this movie.\n\nStill, there is a good amount of atmosphere, the movie is briskly paced (though sometimes incoherent because of this), and the sets/production values are pretty decent. While I wouldn't have recommended anyone to see it at a theater if it had gotten released there, you have to remember there have been far worse films (with and without Stallone) that did get such releases."}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Eye See You", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi715522329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI4MjQ3ZjAtMjRmZi00NDU3LWFkYTAtNDIwYmMxZGRhOGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI4MjQ3ZjAtMjRmZi00NDU3LWFkYTAtNDIwYmMxZGRhOGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:03:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000230/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sylvester Stallone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0160184/characters/nm0000230?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jake Malloy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0908116/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Polly Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0160184/characters/nm0908116?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0585857/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mif"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0160184/characters/nm0585857?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brandon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0942482/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jeffrey Wright"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0160184/characters/nm0942482?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jaworski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002332/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stephen Lang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0160184/characters/nm0002332?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jack Bennett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0558645/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hrothgar Mathews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0160184/characters/nm0558645?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Manny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0698764/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Robert Prosky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0160184/characters/nm0698764?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "McKenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005524/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Courtney B.

I saw it first on Netflix. And then was able to get Season 2 elsewhere. The story is about Rita, as in the title, a parent of a dis-functional single parent family whose character is so well portrayed and played. I do not speak Danish so I relied on the sub- titles but that did not significantly detract me from the film enjoyment. Rita plays the role of a mother, a teacher and a outgoing sexually driven, outspoken individual whose life tribulations make a gripping tale. She is a just as kind and caring a teacher as she is hot headed and aggressive towards her dominant peers and challenges authority wherever she sees it to be unfair or irrational. Makes for a very entertaining and emotional drama.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer [OVS]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4265917977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTBiMDc5ZWYtNDM0OC00ZmQ2LThmOTAtZjE5MGYwMmM4NWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTBiMDc5ZWYtNDM0OC00ZmQ2LThmOTAtZjE5MGYwMmM4NWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-23T10:33:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1738477/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mille Dinesen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1973692/characters/nm1738477?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rita Madsen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3490446/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nikolaj Groth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1973692/characters/nm3490446?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jeppe Madsen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "33 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0385026/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ellen Hillings\u00f8"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1973692/characters/nm0385026?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Helle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4356930/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lise Baastrup"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1973692/characters/nm4356930?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hj\u00f8rdis"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0085079/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carsten Bj\u00f8rnlund"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1973692/characters/nm0085079?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rasmus"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4893561/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kristoffer Fabricius"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1973692/characters/nm4893561?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Uffe"}, {"url": "#", "name": "26 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}]}

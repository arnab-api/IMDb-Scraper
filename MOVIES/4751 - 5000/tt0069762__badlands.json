Eleven innocent people died. Most, though not all, of the killings were random. Starkweather and Fugate's story \"inspired\" several films, including this one.\n\nIn \"Badlands\", the pair's names were changed to Kit Carruthers (Martin Sheen) and Holly Sargis (Sissy Spacek), and their ages were altered slightly. From what I have read, Starkweather and Fugate were emotionally detached and casual about the killings, especially Charles, once the initial murders had occurred. Both Sheen and Spacek do a good job of mimicking this nonchalant attitude. At various points throughout the film, Holly narrates the story in an emotionless, monotone voice. It's like she's reading a diary of what happened as we, the viewers, watch movie footage of the events.\n\nThe film's title is appropriate, given that the characters' inner lives must surely have been wastelands, and given that the film's plot takes place mostly outdoors, on the lonesome High Plains, with its brooding and \"stark\" landscape.\n\nThe film's color cinematography conveys a mood of desolation, especially in those scenes that contain little more than the horizon, expansive blue sky, treeless plains, and a couple of lonely desperados. At one point, the color morphs into sepia-tinted images of small town America, as the whole country, in fear, takes up arms against the fugitives, a photographic change that renders an almost documentary tone to the film.\n\nFrom time to time, classical background music accompanies the senseless violence, a cinematic contrast so \"stark\" as to make the film surreal. And, of course, the sequence toward the end where Kit and Holly, with car radio on, dance in the headlights as Nat King Cole sings \"A Blossom Fell\", is truly mournful and haunting.\n\n\"Badlands\" is incredibly understated and low-key, as detached as the characters portrayed. Director Terrence Malick conveys a simple, uninvolved story, packaged in a film that makes no effort to communicate either symbolism or thematic depth. Nor does the film render judgments about the characters or events. It's an approach that probably wouldn't work today. But it is effective, and through the years the film has gradually become more respected as an excellent character study of 1950's teen rebels without a cause.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Badlands: The Criterion Collection", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2001970713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDIyNDk0MTAtYmZmZS00OWJmLTgxYzEtOGY2NjNlN2UzNjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDIyNDk0MTAtYmZmZS00OWJmLTgxYzEtOGY2NjNlN2UzNjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Three Reasons Criterion Trailer for Badlands", "uploadDate": "2013-06-07T04:04:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000640/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Martin Sheen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0000640?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kit"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0643105/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Warren Oates"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0643105?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0899106/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alan Vint"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0899106?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Deputy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141715/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0141715?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rich Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0861919/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gail Threlkeld"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0861919?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0706610/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Howard Ragsdale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0706610?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Boss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0049893/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dona Baldwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0049893?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Maid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000651/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sissy Spacek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0000651?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Holly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0081560/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ramon Bieri"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0081560?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cato"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0514724/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Gary Littlejohn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0514724?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sheriff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0599738/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bryan Montgomery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0599738?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0280501/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Charles Fitzpatrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0280501?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Clerk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0938807/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Womack Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0938807?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Trooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0106056/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ben Bravo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069762/characters/nm0106056?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Gas Attendant"}]}]}

I'm not usually the guy anyone turns to for recommendations on Romantic Comedies. Rather than dreamy and fantasy-like, I find most of them imbecilic and disrespectful to those of us living in the real world. It's because of this predisposition that I was cautiously optimistic when I heard that Rebel Wilson's new movie offered a satirical look at the genre. Well, it turns out the movie is more spoof than satire, yet I was pleasantly surprised to find it darn funny and quite clever.\n\nThe story begins with a young girl mesmerized while watching Julia Roberts in PRETTY WOMAN. A minute later, the girl's fantasy is shattered when her mother (Jennifer Saunders) explains 'there are no happy endings for girls like us.' We then flash forward 25 years to find that little girl has grown up to become Natalie (Rebel Wilson, PITCH PERFECT), an architect whose lack of confidence and self-esteem has caused her career to stall and her daily life to be a grind (even her dog ghosts her). Additionally, Natalie is a skeptic when it comes to love, and offers up a brilliant rant on the misgivings and pain caused by Romantic Comedies. The rant is directed towards her loyal assistant Whitney (Betty Gilpin, \"GLOW\"), who spends a significant portion of each workday streaming rom-coms at her desk.\n\nOf course, Natalie's rant foreshadows everything we are about to see, and it all occurs after a freak subway accident leaves her concussed. It's at this point where Natalie finds herself trapped within her own Romantic Comedy ... the kind of world she so disdains. All of the familiar rom-com tropes and clich\u00e9s are mixed in, and Natalie is kind enough to literally point out most of them. The obvious comparison here is to Amy Schumer's I FEEL PRETTY, but this film benefits not just from the very talented Ms. Wilson (a master of dry snark), but also a cast that is fully on board.\n\nLiam Hemsworth (aka Mr. Miley Cyrus) appears as Blake, the picturesque, charming and of course, very rich romantic lead. Priyanka Chopra (BAYWATCH) stars as the stunning competition-in-love for Natalie, and Adam Devine (PITCH PERFECT) is Josh, Natalie's nice guy co-worker and not-so-secret admirer who can't seem to escape the friend zone. Given the times, it is a bit surprising to see Brandon Scott Jones take his stereotypical gay friend Donny so over the top. The love quadrangle plays out as expected, yet thanks to the site gags and Rebel's zingers, it's quite entertaining.\n\nDirector Todd Strauss-Schulson and writers Erin Cardillo, Dana Fox, and Katie Silberman clearly have a solid grasp on the repeatable offenses that occur during most romantic comedies, and I would have preferred they cut a bit deeper in their commentary, but understand the decision not to. They offer us a rare Prozac joke, the new phrase \"extra invisible\", and the best use in years of Percy Faith's \"Theme from A Summer Place\". Toying with the PG-13 rating is also part of the gag, and the musical interludes are funny enough, especially the finale presented in Bollywood style. Expect this one to be a favorite on ladies night out, and don't be shocked if some men on dates catch themselves laughing a few times.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3347954201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzY0MTUzMzUtZjlkNC00MDQyLWE2Y2EtZmJiZDg1YjIyMmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzY0MTUzMzUtZjlkNC00MDQyLWE2Y2EtZmJiZDg1YjIyMmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg", "description": "A young woman disenchanted with love mysteriously finds herself trapped inside a romantic comedy.", "uploadDate": "2018-10-31T19:22:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2313103/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rebel Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm2313103?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Natalie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2796745/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Adam Devine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm2796745?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2365811/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Betty Gilpin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm2365811?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Whitney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0766837/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jennifer Saunders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm0766837?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Natalie's Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0419574/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jay Oakerson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm0419574?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1989257/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Marcus Choi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm1989257?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cute Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5729373/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Luciano Acuna Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm5729373?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cute Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7100086/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Zach Cherry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm7100086?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Co-Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2955013/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Liam Hemsworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm2955013?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Blake"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1231899/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Priyanka Chopra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm1231899?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Isabella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1601147/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brandon Scott Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm1601147?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Donny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9219934/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alex Kis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm9219934?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "12 Year Old Natalie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1688626/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rao Rampilla"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm1688626?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Food Cart Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3073902/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hugh Sheridan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm3073902?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cute Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0859403/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Raymond Anthony Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2452244/characters/nm0859403?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Boss"}]}]}

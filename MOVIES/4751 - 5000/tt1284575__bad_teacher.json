However, he calls off their engagement and Elizabeth returns to the school. \n\nElizabeth is reckless, incompetent, pothead and does not give any attention to the students and her coworkers, and she shows movies to her students along the classes. The envious teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) hates Elizabeth and they are estranged to each other. \n\nWhen Elizabeth meets the substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), she discovers that he is very rich and she flirts with him. Further, she learns that Scott likes big breasts and she decides to have a surgery of silicone-implant. She needs to raise US$ 10,000.00 for the breast-implant, and she learns that the teacher that gets the best scores in the state exam would receive US$ 5,700.00 bonus. Elizabeth changes her attitude and teaches her students to prepare them for the exams. However, Elizabeth uses an unethical means to win the competition and Amy seeks evidences to prove that Elizabeth has cheated the exams.\n\n\"Bad Teacher\" is a politically incorrect, brainless but very hilarious film. Cameron Diaz performs the most awful teacher of cinema history, the opposite of Sidney Poitier in \"To Sir with Love\"; Edward James Olmos in \"Stand and Deliver\" or Michelle Pfeiffer in \"Dangerous Minds\". Elizabeth Halsey is a slut, pothead, reckless, gold digger, corrupter, cheater, blackmailer and everything that is not good. But I Laughed a lot with this forgettable film. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Professora sem Classe\" (\"Teacher without Class\")", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bad Teacher", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3131219225", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3MDA5MTgyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1Njc2NA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE3MDA5MTgyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1Njc2NA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Foul-mouthed school teacher Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) sets her sights on a well-heeled new instructor (Timberlake) and concocts a scheme to win him over, though he has eyes for her more popular colleague (Punch).", "uploadDate": "2011-03-12T10:03:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000139/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cameron Diaz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1284575/characters/nm0000139?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elizabeth Halsey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0781981/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Segel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1284575/characters/nm0781981?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Russell Gettis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809613/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Phyllis Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1284575/characters/nm0809613?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lynn Davies"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0020405/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dave Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1284575/characters/nm0020405?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sandy Pinkus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2298331/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matthew J.

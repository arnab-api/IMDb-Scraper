Whether they are minimized in print, or spoken in a hushed tone at the close of television commercials, side effects have become a shady companion of prescription drugs. Side Effects, Steven Soderbergh's alleged final film, focuses on the consequences visited upon a young couple after the side effects from the wife's medication cause her to commit an alarming act. As the chasm opens beneath this young woman, her psychiatrist struggles with his responsibility for her predicament, and confront his lingering suspicion about his patient's state of mind.\n\nEver the auteur, Soderbergh remains delightfully unpredictable with this latest feature. Side Effects initially presents itself as an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry, wearing its heavy-handed message on its sleeve, but promptly converts into a psychological suspense thriller. Soderbergh stares you directly in the eyes while he rips the rug from beneath your feet, sending you spiraling toward a conclusion that is equally unexpected and pleasing. Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns (Contagion, The Bourne Ultimatum) channel Hitchcock, creating an in-depth narrative that remains unpredictable until its final scene. \n\nSoderbergh is known for generating a positive film environment for his cast, and maximizing the actors' potential in his films. Although the cast for Side Effects is comprised of actors who have previously provided impressive performances, each actor presents a character that rivals any prior roles. Rooney Mara plays the young woman at the epicenter of the conflict. Mara is extremely engrossing, creating an aura of discontent and depression within her situation. She acts as the film's catalyst, holding all the characters together while prompting them toward their conclusions. Attractive, graceful, and erratic, Mara is the wounded girl who isn't all that she seems.\n\nWhile the film's driving force is Mara, Jude Law is its principle focus. As Mara's overwhelmed psychiatrist, Law provides his most empathetic role to date. Law establishes a flawed character who struggles with the consequences forced upon him, and transforms into a protagonist worthy of our admiration. Law and Mara provide such intriguing characterizations, Soderbergh seems to have difficulty deciding which to devote more time to. The scenes they share are the most arresting in this film.\n\nThere are few things more satisfying than a film which receives little attention, but creates an unexpectedly entertaining experience. Though Soderbergh has billed Side Effects as his swan song, he confirms that he is a cinematic mastermind in a film that would be an impressive conclusion to an eccentric career. Indulge in this unconventional thriller; you won't mind the side effects.\n\nflickermotion.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Version 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2365630233", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTA3NDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MjQwOQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTA3NDEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MjQwOQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Emily and Martin are a successful New York couple whose world unravels when a new drug prescribed by Emily's psychiatrist - intended to treat anxiety - has unexpected side effects.", "uploadDate": "2013-02-01T12:04:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1913734/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rooney Mara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm1913734?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emily Taylor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1677477/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marin Ireland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm1677477?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Upset Visitor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0237164/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Polly Draper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm0237164?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emily's Boss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5486184/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Haraldo Alvarez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm5486184?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Garage Attendant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1353808/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "James Martinez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm1353808?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Police Officer at Hospital"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0030751/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jacqueline Antaramian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm0030751?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Desk Nurse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001876/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Catherine Zeta-Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm0001876?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dr. Victoria Siebert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0182345/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "David Costabile"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm0182345?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Carl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1439162/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carmen Pelaez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm1439162?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Prison Desk Guard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1475594/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Channing Tatum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm1475594?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Martin Taylor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235652/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ann Dowd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm0235652?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Martin's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000179/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jude Law"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm0000179?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Jonathan Banks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2479938/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Vladimir Versailles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm2479938?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Augustin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3605847/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Michelle Vergara Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm3605847?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1705090/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Katie Lowes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2053463/characters/nm1705090?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Conference Organizer"}]}]}

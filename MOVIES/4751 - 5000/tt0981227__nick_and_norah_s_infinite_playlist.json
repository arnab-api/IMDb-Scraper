This movie has my main pet peeve with the younger generation of today, the people who are the \"I heard this band before you did so I have better taste than you do\" type of mentality. The independent rock music movies are just not my thing, so I wasn't too excited to see this movie, but when some friends invited me to go see it with them, I had low expectations and actually ended up having a great time watching Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. It's honestly one of the better comedies that is out in theaters right now, although I have to admit I feel so dirty watching all these horny teenage girls, I'm a girl, and it just made me feel uncomfortable, this is how teenagers act? Scary; anyways, the story is really fun and gives you a great time laughing.\n\nNick is having a hard time after his rough break up with super slutty Tris, he continues to mix CD's for her that her fellow student, Norah listens too and enjoys it. By chance Norah meets Nick not knowing that it's Tris's ex and says that he's her boyfriend to show Tris that she's no prude. But when Norah learns that Nick is the ex, Nick also won't shut up about Tris, but they find out throughout the night that maybe they're musical soul mates and can really dig each other's vibe. But in the mean time with their crazy friends, they try to find their favorite band that is hidden in New York.\n\nNick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is definitely worth the look, I would say that it's worth full price. The only thing I have a problem with is our leading man, Michael Cera, this guy is a nice actor, but he hasn't really expanded himself into different roles, he's been playing the same character since Superbad to be honest. But I'm seeing Kat Dennings more and more, I'm enjoying her presence on screen, she's very lovely and has potential. But the person who definitely stole the show was Norah's drunk friend, Caroline played by Ari Graynor, she was just beyond hilarious and stole all the laughs. Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is a great new teen comedy, though I really hope teenagers don't act like this... if they do... oh, I'm praying that our future is going to be alright.\n\n7/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "DVD trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1681326873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNTM1NzA2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUwOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNTM1NzA2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUwOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The trailer for the upcoming DVD release of Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist", "uploadDate": "2009-01-31T18:12:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0148418/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Cera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0981227/characters/nm0148418?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1683094/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Aaron Yoo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0981227/characters/nm1683094?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0310966/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ari Graynor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0981227/characters/nm0310966?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Caroline"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2822739/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jonathan B.

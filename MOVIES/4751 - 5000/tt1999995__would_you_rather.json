The plot assumes that none of the guests told their friends or families where they were going, and that somehow everyone involved can keep quiet about the events. This seems beyond the realm of possibility, but for the sake of the story, I would let it slide.\n\nSecond, I have mixed feelings about the score. While some of it was excellent, other parts seems very repetitive and overpowered the film itself. I might even go so far as to say it deserved a better rating if the music was toned down.\n\nThat being said, there are plenty of good things to say about the film. The overall concept is very chilling, and far more disturbing than the average horror film. Some might put this in the \"torture porn\" subgenre of horror, but I felt like it never sunk to the depths of \"Hostel\" or the later \"Saw\" films. If anything, the structure was more like \"13\" (2010). These are events that could happen (again, if we ignore the overall implausibility) rather than a man who stalks us in our dreams.\n\nThe doctor subplot was excellent, and well-scripted. It was possibly the best part. Jeffrey Combs was nice to see, actually getting more than a cameo. Stealing the show, though, was Sasha Grey, an actress who made her name in the adult film business (the one in a million who an successfully make the transition). Her character (Amy) is the wild card that brings the situation towards complete chaos, and that is where the game gets challenging.\n\nNo masterpiece by any means, but with the right editing, this could have been a slightly stronger film. Either way, it was still better than half of the movies I see...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2877073177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwMzUwOTQ4NjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDg2MTcyMzMx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwMzUwOTQ4NjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDg2MTcyMzMx._V1_.jpg", "description": "Desperate to help her ailing brother, a young woman agrees to compete in a deadly game hosted by a sadistic aristocrat.", "uploadDate": "2013-02-12T19:51:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0811242/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brittany Snow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm0811242?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Iris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185431/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jonny Coyne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm0185431?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bevans"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2222175/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Enver Gjokaj"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm2222175?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lucas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001334/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Heard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm0001334?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Conway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1100337/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eddie Steeples"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm1100337?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2088699/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Robin Lord Taylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm2088699?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Julian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2383250/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Logan Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm2383250?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Raleigh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1784872/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ptolemy Slocum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm1784872?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Shift Manager"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001062/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeffrey Combs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm0001062?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Shepard Lambrick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0319142/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lawrence Gilliard Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm0319142?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Barden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2340248/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sasha Grey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm2340248?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Amy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0389324/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Charlie Hofheimer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm0389324?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Travis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0820053/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "June Squibb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm0820053?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Linda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1036211/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robb Wells"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm1036211?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Peter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0147738/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Larry Cedar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1999995/characters/nm0147738?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Driver"}]}]}

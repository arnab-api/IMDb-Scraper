This 1978 comedy-horror is one of Dante's early movies, but despite that he shows an assured touch and gets generously tongue-in-cheek performances from his cast of horror veterans. While the film is never a truly great rival to the awesome Jaws, it is a fun and entertaining homage that has much going for it. Easily the strong point of this film is the gruesome make-up provided by whiz-kid Rob Bottin, but more will be said of that later.\n\nA couple of teenagers go missing while trekking through the woods. Private eye Maggie McKeown (Heather Menzies) goes searching for them, and discovers a burnt-out hermit Paul Grogan (Bradford Dillman) living on the mountainside who offers to help her in her hunt. McKeown and Grogan stumble upon a secluded military research centre where crazed scientist Dr. Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) is busily conducting experiments to create a strain of piranha fish able to survive in rivers and oceans, and always eager to devour anything in their way. The plan is to release these super-fish in enemy rivers, thereby making the entire river system too dangerous to use. McKeown and Grogan mistakenly release the piranhas into the local river, and realise that anyone using the river for recreation \u0096 including the bustling summer camp miles downstream \u0096 are now in desperate danger. The army is brought in, but instead of helping to solve the terrifying situation they seem more concerned with covering up the whole business. In particular, General Waxman (Bruce Gordon) has cause to keep the existence of the piranha secret, as he has invested his savings in the summer camp and doesn't want to scare away his paying customers. In a race against time, Grogan and McKeown try to release poison into the river to prevent the piranhas from devouring everyone in sight and proceeding to the ocean\u0085..\n\nPiranha is fast-moving, gory fun. It's nice to see Dillman in a heroic leading role after so many years of playing the supporting bad guy in numerous films. Menzies is fine as his partner-in-adventure, and there are great supporting roles for horror legends like Barbara Steele (as a military scientist), Dick Miller (as a cowboy entertainer) and Keenan Wynn (as Grogan's doomed buddy who lives at the riverside). As I said earlier, Rob Bottin provides some bloody make up effects that make some of the half-eaten victims look pretty yucky. The gently mocking script is by John Sayles, and is full of humorous references to earlier books and films along the same theme. The finale in which the holiday-makers fall foul of the piranha fish is packed with blood and guts, and should definitely appeal to gore-hounds. Even though the film keeps its tongue in its cheek, there are still some dumb moments along the way that mar credibility even on this level. For instance, Grogan spends much of the closing scenes underwater being attacked by the piranha\u0085. earlier in the film we were made to believe that the piranha devoured their victims in literally a few seconds, but they seem to make ludicrously hard work of attacking Grogan while he's in the water (in fact, he surfaces after several minutes in the firing line with just a few bites, which seems somewhat fortuitous!!) Piranha is enjoyable, though, and should be well received by genre addicts.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Piranha: Roger Corman's Cult Classics", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2336861721", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2IyODg0NjYtZThmNS00ZDkzLTllODktZDBkYmQzODg4Nzc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2IyODg0NjYtZThmNS00ZDkzLTllODktZDBkYmQzODg4Nzc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Piranha", "uploadDate": "2015-03-07T07:50:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226947/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bradford Dillman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0226947?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Grogan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002994/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin McCarthy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0002994?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Robert Hoak"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0588241/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dick Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0588241?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Buck Gardner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0049470/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Belinda Balaski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0049470?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Betsy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0330050/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bruce Gordon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0330050?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Colonel Waxman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000860/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paul Bartel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0000860?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mr. Dumont"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0625739/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Shawn Nelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0625739?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Whitney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0820092/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Janie Squire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0820092?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Barbara Randolph"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0579991/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Heather Menzies-Urich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0579991?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Maggie McKeown"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0943978/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Keenan Wynn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0943978?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0824489/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Barbara Steele"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0824489?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dr. Mengers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0779567/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Melody Thomas Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0779567?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Laura Dickinson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0113077/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Barry Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0113077?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Trooper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0172678/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Shannon Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0172678?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Suzie Grogan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212586/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Richard Deacon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078087/characters/nm0212586?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Earl Lyon"}]}]}

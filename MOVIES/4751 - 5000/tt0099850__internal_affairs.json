When IA officers investigate Peck's partner Van Stretch for planting drugs on a suspect and using unnecessary force, they decide to look into Peck more. However Peck knows how to exploit weakness in those around him and begins to clear up the loose links around him while pushing all Raymond Avila's buttons.\n\nThis was Figgis' first American film and he made an excellent start.  The dark plot is pretty simple in terms of beginning, middle, start.  What makes it so much more than that is the characters are so well drawn.  Peck and Avila both become like each other the more we know about them, their methods, their thoughts and their weaknesses are all similar.  It makes it harder to fit everyone into the mould of good guys and bad guys and keeps everything more interesting.  The various twists don't always make sense but the film is forceful enough to keep everything moving.\n\nGere is on best form here, playing a character against type he is the embodiment of corruption, deceit and murder.  Garcia is also excellent as Raymond, who blends his actions well from good into bad.  Metcalfe is excellent as Garcia's partner who may or may not be motivated by the hatred of Gere's macho personae.  It's also good to see Baldwin, Travis and Xander Berkley have good roles.\n\nOverall this is a dark thriller that blends characters into one mess of corruption in the police.  It is an excellent film with great characters."}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000152/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Gere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0000152?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dennis Peck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001802/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nancy Travis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0001802?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kathleen Avilla"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103071/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richard Bradford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0103071?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Grieb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004729/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Beach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0004729?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dorian Fletcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002109/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Faye Grant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0002109?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Penny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0075359/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Xander Berkeley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0075359?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rudy Mohr"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226851/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Victoria Dillard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0226851?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0286759/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Susan Forristal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0286759?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Lolly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000412/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Andy Garcia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0000412?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Raymond Avilla"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0582418/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Laurie Metcalf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0582418?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Amy Wallace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000287/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "William Baldwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0000287?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Van Stretch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0097274/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Katherine Borowitz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0097274?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tova Arrocas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0438127/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "John Kapelos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0438127?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Steven Arrocas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0135306/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Capodice"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0135306?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Chief Healy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0195921/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Pamella D'Pella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099850/characters/nm0195921?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Cheryl"}]}]}

But here goes mine ....\n\nSo basically this film is a combination of the style and horror rom com of Shaun of the Dead and the 1960s dark rebellious movies such as IF , Unman Wittering and Zigo , Goodbye Mr Chips . If you've seen those films you'll get the comedy cues . If you haven't you might struggle . It also has more than a little parody of Harry Potter.\n\nWhat was good about the movie ? Casting - casting a female lead who's actual name is Harmoine was genius ! Simon Pegg and Margot Robbie's failing romance . The matron was a great casting real St Trinians styling .\n\nWhat was not so good ? Martin Sheen and Simon Peggs characters seem to merge into one the scripting could have been better here . It couldn't be described as horror the creatures weren't at all horrific . At times it laboured and you felt you wanted the film to end quicker .\n\nThe themes were reluctant aspiration , good over evil ,failing and seemingly unobtainable romance . Bullying . Deceit . Parental pressure . Isolation and abandonment. Tradition vs contemporary and changing times and accepting of LGBTQ's etc\n\nIt was a story of symbolism and the changing landscape of the economics of the country , whereas public schools were originally for the male elite to be shoehorned into their roles of leading the country the Slaughterhouse school ( looking a lot like Stowe ) has to reluctantly adapt itself to accepting girls and foreign students to prop up its finances .\n\nThen there's the more sinister side of the headmaster's dealings with unethical corporations and the final retribution of triumph of good over evil.\n\nHorror fans might be disappointed by the lack of actual horror - it certainly wasn't a movie where you'd jump out of your skin but it wasn't a bad movie and is an enjoyable watch if you go there with the right expectations . The comedy propped it up .\n\nPad.A 8/10 Padreviews", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi203602713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJiYTM1Y2EtYjdmNS00YjhkLWFlZmItYjkyYWIzNDI4ZWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJiYTM1Y2EtYjdmNS00YjhkLWFlZmItYjkyYWIzNDI4ZWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An illustrious British boarding school becomes a bloody battleground when a mysterious sinkhole appears at a nearby fracking site unleashing unspeakable horror.", "uploadDate": "2018-08-09T14:16:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3053338/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Margot Robbie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm3053338?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Audrey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2633535/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Asa Butterfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm2633535?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Willoughby Blake"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6806440/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Finn Cole"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm6806440?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Don Wallace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5795508/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hermione Corfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm5795508?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Clemsie Lawrence"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5598573/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kit Connor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm5598573?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Wootton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1276507/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Alex Macqueen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm1276507?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lambert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3284401/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jamie Blackley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm3284401?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Caspar De Brunose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2877285/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Isabella Laughland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm2877285?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kay"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0790688/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Sheen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm0790688?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "The Bat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0670408/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Simon Pegg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm0670408?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Meredith Houseman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0366846/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jo Hartley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm0366846?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Babs Wallace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0296545/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nick Frost"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm0296545?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Woody Chapman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4151189/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tom Rhys Harries"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm4151189?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Clegg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2623902/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jassa Ahluwalia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm2623902?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Yuri"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5427256/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hanako Footman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6905696/characters/nm5427256?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Poppet Chenvix-Trench"}]}]}

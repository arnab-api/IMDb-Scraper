He had worked previously on many of the Bond movies but during the eighties he directed all 5 Bond movies, and with the exception of 'A View To A Kill', they are up there with the best of the whole series. Certainly 'For Your Eyes Only' and the follow up, 'Octopussy' are the best of the Moore years, and I don't think it would be overstating it to say that Glen may have single handedly saved the franchise.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s Bond had turned from Ian Fleming's masterspy  into an entirely comic book creation, culminating in the preposterous shenanigans of 'Moonraker' in 1979. At the start of a new decade a new style is clearly apparent, with a back to basics story that actually involves some spying, and a genuine threat to world peace. It's pushing it to say that the story is believable, but it is realistically told and is certainly a more adult affair than the previous efforts.\n\nThe film starts with the final nail in the coffin for Blofeld. After years of legal wrangling over who had the rights to the character the filmmakers decided to show that they didn't need him anyway and unceremoniously dumped him once and for all. We are also immediately put in the mood for a far more serious Bond when he visits his late wife's grave, an unusual moment, not least because the movies rarely referenced previous actors in the role. Here we are reminded that Moore wasn't playing Bond at the time of his marriage. That serious tone pervades throughout the movie, with less wisecracking than usual, and a subdued villain, at odds with the expected megalomaniac we are used to. But the film is all the better for it. There are some fantastic action set-pieces including a chase in a Citroen 2CV, and a ski chase that tops even that of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', along with a tense finale that is literally a cliffhanger. Bond is actually forced to use his wits, and much of the action and escapes are less contrived than one would expect. It's also good to see (after 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and 'Moonraker') that the filmmakers have tried to get back to Fleming's Bond, with many ideas lifted from the original stories. The scene with Bond and Melina dragged behind the speedboat, for example, is taken directly from the novel of 'Live And Let Die', and many characters appear in Fleming's short story of the same name.\n\nAdd to the mix a fine cast, notably Carole Bouquet as another strong character in the list of 'Bond women', and you have a satisfying and thrilling entry in the series."}, "duration": "PT2H7M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "For Your Eyes Only", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi123601433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM3ZGZiMzctNjNhZC00YWVmLTkyZWYtNmM2MTUxZTg1YTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM3ZGZiMzctNjNhZC00YWVmLTkyZWYtNmM2MTUxZTg1YTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this James Bond classic", "uploadDate": "2009-10-09T12:17:49Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000549/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roger Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0000549?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Bond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0867694/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Topol"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0867694?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Columbo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002103/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Julian Glover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0002103?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kristatos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0071824/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jill Bennett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0071824?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brink"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0943840/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Wyman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0943840?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kriegler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561755/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lois Maxwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0561755?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Moneypenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0444584/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Geoffrey Keen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0444584?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Minister of Defence"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0898376/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "James Villiers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0898376?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tanner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000962/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carole Bouquet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0000962?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Melina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000468/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lynn-Holly Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0000468?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bibi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364520/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cassandra Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0364520?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lisl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331788/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Michael Gothard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0331788?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Locque"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0373324/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jack Hedley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0373324?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Havelock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005155/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Desmond Llewelyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0005155?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Q"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331770/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Walter Gotell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0082398/characters/nm0331770?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "General Gogol"}]}]}

Granted, in my mind, Naomi Watts's performance in \"Mulholland Dr.\" was exceptional, but that was over ten years ago, so I made a deliberate effort not to compare the roles. I had not seen any reviews and did not know anything about the movie, except its title character. I knew the main outlines of Diana's life and had seen some of her interviews, although I was more familiar with her death. Thus I had no opinion of Diana herself, except that I had heard a little of her famous charity work. With these things in mind I went to the theater. To me the movie was excellent. The atmosphere was enchanting and at times haunting. Watts played Diana like a shape shifter, matching her every move when the character presented herself to the media, while breaking her facade in private. She portrayed tons of difficult emotion that had to convey an aristocratic filter created by the character's upbringing. Diana's life was presented as a complex mixture of personal and public, feelings and constraints, that lead to her being slowly crushed by the outside pressures she could not control. The movie's purpose was obviously apolitical and tried to convey Diana's driving force that was interpreted in the movie as love. It succeeded in this very convincingly. The credit for this goes not only to Watts, but also the director Oliver Hirschbiegel (who, I now notice, directed \"Der Untergang\", an exceptional film in its own right) and Naveen Andrews, who played his role with credibility and originality. Altogether I found the movie to be on-par with the best biographical dramatizations in film, even coming close to \"King's Speech\".\n\nNow that I had seen the film, and had been thoroughly impressed by it, imagine my surprise when I tuned in on IMDb. At this moment the score was 4.9. I immediately noticed a pattern. Of all the 2900 voters 446 (15.4 %) had voted 1. In fact the value 1 dominated the chart, being the most frequent vote of all the values. I interpreted this is a symptom of pure ignorance. Obviously the movie is not the worst of all time, like for example \"The Room\", \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" or \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". There in fact seems to be an almost organized effort to trash the movie. I do not think this has much to do with the film itself, but is a continuation of the politicization of Diana's life. I would recommend, when reading reviews, to recognize the critics who judge the film based on their own preconceived notions and those who judge the film on its own merits.\n\nMy score for \"Diana\" is between 8 and 9, which rounds it up to 9.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1800317209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMTk1OTU0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYzMjMzMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMTk1OTU0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYzMjMzMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "During the last two years of her life, Princess Diana embarks on a final rite of passage: a secret love affair with Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan.", "uploadDate": "2013-09-27T14:21:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915208/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Naomi Watts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0915208?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Diana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0249876/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charles Edwards"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0249876?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Patrick Jephson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388061/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Douglas Hodge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0388061?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paul Burrell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416524/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Geraldine James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0416524?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Oonagh Shanley-Toffolo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5009047/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rose O'Loughlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm5009047?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nurse Denise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004710/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Naveen Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0004710?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hasnat Khan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0943031/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Max Wrottesley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0943031?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "News of the World Photographer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5103299/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nathaniel Facey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm5103299?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dwayne Johnson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0031679/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cas Anvar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0031679?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dodi Fayed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0699858/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James Puddephatt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0699858?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Security Guard 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2802899/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ilan Goodman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm2802899?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Diana Assistant 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2373081/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Prasanna Puwanarajah"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm2373081?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Martin Bashir"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352905/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Michael Hadley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0352905?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joseph Toffollo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0828980/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Juliet Stevenson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0828980?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sonia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0083250/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Christopher Birch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1758595/characters/nm0083250?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ronnie Scott"}]}]}

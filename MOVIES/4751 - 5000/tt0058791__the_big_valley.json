I liked it back in the 1970s, and then again lately with its run on the Hallmark Channel.\n\nIf this show was not an authentic Western, who cares?  The show had enough chutzpah and special qualities to make it so likeable.  One episode, \"Miranda,\" which aired 15 January 1968, had one scene that made me take notice.  The title character, a Mexican revolutionary played by Barbara Luna, asked Napoleon Whiting, who played the African-American servant Silas, if slavery had been outlawed.  The exchange between those two characters was a sort of icebreak, because of the stereotypical roles African-Americans had played in the movies and television for so long.  At last, this concept is being questioned!  This is the same year that \"Julia\" (1968) debuted.\n\nThe cast is fun.  I liked Barbara Stanwyck, and I remember seeing Richard Long in 1970's \"Nanny and the Professor.\"  He is definitely missed.  Peter Breck is also great, and I also like seeing Lee Majors in this role instead of \"The Six Million Dollar Man.\"  It is too bad that the series lasted only four years.  It was such a fascinating series!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Big Valley: Season 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4223057177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFiZjcyY2UtODkyMy00OGJlLWEyOWItMDJkNDQwNGM2MTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFiZjcyY2UtODkyMy00OGJlLWEyOWItMDJkNDQwNGM2MTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Big Valley: Season 2", "uploadDate": "2019-03-15T02:31:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519160/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Long"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058791/characters/nm0519160?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jarrod Barkley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1965-1969"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000516/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lee Majors"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058791/characters/nm0000516?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Heath"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1965-1969"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001766/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Barbara Stanwyck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058791/characters/nm0001766?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Victoria Barkley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1965-1969"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0106539/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Peter Breck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058791/characters/nm0106539?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nick Barkley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1965-1969"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002067/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Linda Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058791/characters/nm0002067?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Audra Barkley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "112 episodes, 1965-1969"}]}]}

Angelina Jolie stars as FBI Agent Illeana Scott. Illeana has both strengths and weaknesses,which are both done in the right way. She is a very smart detective and can pick up clues that many could not and leads the way to many places that the other detectives would never have found. She does not come off as the hardened, tough cop that would have made this movie much worse. Instead, she usually gets the short end of the stick when forced to do physical battle with lowlifes and even other cops. She is flawed and vulnerable but can put up a hell of a fight when needed but relies on her brain to beat a larger and stronger foe. For an example of how to do this the wrong way, see Ashley Judd (of whom I'm also a fan of) in Twisted. \n\nOlivier Martinez plays a character I find hard to like at any part of the film named Paquette. Paquette is a Canadian cop who has issues with bringing the FBI in (I'm not sure if the FBI actually assists in Canadian affairs, but this is just a movie). Olivier seems likable as a person and I'm not familiar with his work, as I'm sure it is mostly French. I'll chalk it up to good acting.\n\nKeifer Sutherland had only what seemed to be a bit part here and could have been used a bit more. He was probably in and out in 2 days of filming.\n\nAnd finally, Ethan Hawke did a fine job for his role, but I think they could have made a better choice for this character.\n\nAs I said earlier, those of us who see many of these types of movies will probably see most of the twists before they happen. Many of them well before they happen. Some of you will know everything that's going to happen before it happens, such as I did, but I still think it was a good story and was entertained. I can honestly recommend this one for at least a rental."}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Taking Lives", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi92799257", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJlZTI3NzktMDgzZS00Nzk1LWFlODMtNjc5ODUxMjBmYmIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJlZTI3NzktMDgzZS00Nzk1LWFlODMtNjc5ODUxMjBmYmIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:06:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001401/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Angelina Jolie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0001401?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Illeana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000662/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kiefer Sutherland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0000662?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0553648/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Olivier Martinez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0553648?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paquette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000767/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jean-Hugues Anglade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0000767?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Duval"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0154226/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Justin Chatwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0154226?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matt Soulsby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0878625/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Billy Two Rivers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0878625?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Car Salesman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0693625/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Julien Poulin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0693625?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Qu\u00e9bec City Inspector"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0856351/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Christian Tessier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0856351?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Interrogation Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000160/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ethan Hawke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0000160?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Costa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001687/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gena Rowlands"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0001687?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mrs. Asher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001409/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tch\u00e9ky Karyo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0001409?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Leclair"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0200452/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Paul Dano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0200452?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Young Asher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0480232/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Lacoste"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0480232?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cashier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0501344/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Richard Lemire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0501344?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Qu\u00e9bec City Cop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0189887/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0364045/characters/nm0189887?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Medical Examiner"}]}]}

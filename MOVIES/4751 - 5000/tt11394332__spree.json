Personally, right from the jump Joe Keery and the visual direction of imitating a failing YouTube channel are spot on. It gives you more than enough context as to why you shouldn't sympathize with this fame obsessed dork while also helping establish just how authentic this type of person is, you probably know someone like Kurt. The tone the movie establishes is so bold, as it it should considering the main character is basically an Elliot Rodger type. This is such a taboo subject to explore in a low-budget horror comedy and I think the decision to play it so ridiculous makes the film flow a lot better than if they were trying to make this an actual compelling story. The comparison's to \"Crank\" are fair but even that had a serious relationship that kept propelling the character and story. 9 times out of 10 I really hate films that try to satirize internet culture in such an audacious way cuz it's normally not pulled off well and feels like it was written by out of touch people who clearly don't know what they're riffing. Fortunately that's not the case here, every character who uses the internet in the film feels appropriately written for what they're meant to represent. I hope Joe Keery and everyone involved in making this and getting it out don't focus on the negative reviews, I have a feeling people are gonna come around to this and I hope this inspires more people to try making inspired films like this with whatever means they have even if it's just phones and GoPros.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1115078169", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZhYmQ1MzQtZWY5ZS00ZDM4LWI1ZWEtZDBiYzMzYjg5OGZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZhYmQ1MzQtZWY5ZS00ZDM4LWI1ZWEtZDBiYzMzYjg5OGZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Kurt is a young rideshare driver who is so desperate for social media attention that he'll stop at nothing to go viral.

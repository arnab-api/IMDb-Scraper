Women can envision the perfect cake, the perfect dress, and their perfect man waiting for them at the alter.  Men envision their perfect beautiful bride and lifetime of happiness.  But neither person ever seems to think of the possibilities of what can go wrong in a marriage, especially right off the bat at the honeymoon.  Romantic comedies often deliver the fantasy of flawless courtships that lead to flawless relationships.  \"Just Married\" presents a different formula by showing the possible faults and blunders that may and in some cases, will happen on the 'perfect honeymoon.\n\n \"Just Married\"\u00a8 is the story of the romance between Tom Leezak (Ashton Kutcher) and Sarah McNerney (Brittany Murphy).  Tom, the graveyard shift traffic announcer on KNR radio, is just an average Joe.  A recent college graduate who lives at a beach loft with his best friend and thinks the finer things in life include anything with ESPN.  Sarah is on the opposite side of the looking glass.  The daughter of the wealthy owner of the Los Angeles sporting teams, Sarah is accustomed to having the luxuries of life.  But in Tom, she sees a different cut from the run-of-the-mill aristocrats she has dated and the two are soon married.  But on their European honeymoon, the couple immediately begins to experience problems.  From difficulties with a European outlet to questions with marital fidelity, the newlyweds soon ponder the question that everyone has been asking, 'Are they too young to be married'?\n\n\"Just Married\" is a very enjoyable collaboration between director Shawn Levy (Big Fat Liar) and screenwriter Sam Harper (Rookie of the Year).  Levy's skill behind the camera is key in bringing comedic success to the movies many pratfalls and hits.  One such usage is of a split screen as Tom and Sarah attempt to consummate their marriage on the airplane.  Harper's script, while at times seems comically generic, is careful not to overrun gags.  Harper also creates humorous dialogue between Tom and Sarah by implementing speeches that only man like Tom would consider on his honeymoon, I.E., does the hotel have satellite television and why doesn't the French hotel have signs in English.\n\n Harper's contrasting characters are brought to life by the outlandish slapstick of Ashton Kutcher and the sweetness of Brittany Murphy.  Kutcher's antics establish the mentality and character of Leezak and display Kutcher's potential to be a rising star in the industry.  But Kutcher does not merely rely on his comedic behavior in the film.  Kutcher also shows that despite Tom's ignorance, he truly loves his new wife and would do anything to make her happy.  Murphy is equally good in her role as Sarah.  Despite Sarah's prosperous upbringing, Murphy plays the character as a person very down to earth where wealth has not spoiled her.  She is neither cruel nor snobbish and the audience can feel the genuine love she has for her husband. Audiences will be able to sympathize with Murphy when she experiences heartache and fall in love with her when she readily forgives her husbands behavior.\n\n\"Just Married\" is a wonderfully surprising romantic comedy.  It differs from the usual lovey-dovey recipe and adds more outrageous events that may occur in a courtship and marriage.  Kutcher and Murphy make a superb comedic team and do the film justice with their performances.  Although Kutcher is known for his roles as a dim-witted male, he adds to his character by adding loyalty and love.  Murphy is also great as the contrasting better half. Despite the films silliness, it does deliver a final message of love and devotion that makes the movie appeal to the male and female audience.  Movie lovers of comedy will not be disappointed nor will the romantics.  Like a perfect marriage, \"Just Married\" is equally balanced."}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Just Married", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2510881049", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQwNzMzYzQtOGFjZS00M2FiLTljZTEtZDQ3ZGViOGViOTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQwNzMzYzQtOGFjZS00M2FiLTljZTEtZDQ3ZGViOGViOTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:15:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005110/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ashton Kutcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0005110?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0437283/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christian Kane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0437283?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter Prentiss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005195/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Monet Mazur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0005195?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lauren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0524745/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Thad Luckinbill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0524745?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Willie McNerney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0453115/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Taran Killam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0453115?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dickie McNerney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0865084/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Toshi Toda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0865084?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Yuan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1012137/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Massimo Schina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm1012137?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fredo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0858450/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Alex Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0858450?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Fred"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005261/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Brittany Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0005261?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0608378/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "David Moscow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0608378?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0711058/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Rasche"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm0711058?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. McNerney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1290815/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Agranov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0305711/characters/nm1290815?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Paul McNerney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000855/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Raymond J.

This show is a classic.  James Bond without the gadgets, or over the top criminals are here. The Saint was the work of Leslie Charteris; an Asian-American writer who penned many books and his character came to life in many 40's B-movies. There was even a show; with Vincent Price as the Saint. The defining Saint was of course Roger Moore's Simon Templar.  A suave, sophisticated jet setter who always was available to do a good deed.  His character had an edge; a perception at least, of an international rogue. He was first and foremost a man with a strong sense of right and wrong and would do anything to make things right. The Saint ran from 1962-1969 and is still beloved and with good reason. Roger Moore does the Saint with a flair and the supporting characters are always well defined and twists and turns of the plot are always there. There was an informal ensemble cast and many of the same actors play different characters. I had mixed feelings about Inspector Teal (Ivor Dean), he is always duped and his character, although well played, was a bit of an idiot.  Still Inspector Teal had some charm. The series had recurring writers including my favorite: Terry Nation. (For those Doctor Who fans, Terry Nation is of course, the creator of the Daleks). Harry Junkin was the writer of the more fluid episodes.\n\nAnyone who appreciates mystery, intrigue and well played characters, has to appreciate the Saint. The Saint gets 9.9/10 stars."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Saint: The Sporting Chance", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi17087769", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUzMzFiZTEtMTkxNS00YzE3LTg0MjYtYTMwNWJmMWRhMTM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUzMzFiZTEtMTkxNS00YzE3LTg0MjYtYTMwNWJmMWRhMTM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Saint: The Sporting Chance", "uploadDate": "2019-04-12T04:53:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000549/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roger Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055701/characters/nm0000549?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Simon Templar"}, {"url": "#", "name": "118 episodes, 1962-1969"}]}]}

Ray Charles was a brilliant, fascinating man who lead a complex, challenging life. There was simply no way to fit it all - or even touch on it all - in a standard length movie. Given that, the makers of this film did an admirable (and I'm sure quite agonizing) job of putting together a film that could not tell the whole story yet managed to set forth a representative sampling of the man and his music. Ray Charles' strengths were evident throughout the film and his weaknesses were neither amplified nor sugar-coated. We could have wished for another hour chronicling his life after 1980, but I suppose that would have tended to turn the film into an homage and, while it would have also allowed for the resolution of several things that were left hanging at the end, on balance I guess it was better as presented.\n\nNow for the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? The wife and I have seen untold numbers of films in our years, but we immediately agreed that we have never seen a performance the equal of Jamie Foxx's. The line between actor and character was not blurred - but rather it disappeared completely. We had heard much of the hype before seeing the movie, but this was uncanny. Foxx WAS Ray Charles. You didn't watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching Foxx do an outstanding job of portraying Ray Charles - you watched it somehow believing or understanding that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I don't know how else to put it. We were completely blown away. I'll admit that we haven't seen all of the other performances up for an Oscar this year, but that really doesn't matter. Foxx took this to a whole nuther level, one which we've never witnessed before and doubt that we may ever see again. I can think of no other movie I've ever seen in which a person playing a part so completely and convincingly became the person portrayed. We salute you, Mr. Foxx. We understand that the awarding of an Oscar has to do with much more than the performance, but whether or not you win, we want you to know that you have done something that is in a class absolutely by itself and you should take enormous pride in your unparalleled achievement.\n\nP.S. The music was naturally great. I remarked to the wife that if there is one moment in the history of music to which I wish I could have been witness, it would have been the genesis (in Kansas City, wasn't it?) of What'd I Say? The film did a wonderful job with it - just wish I could've been there!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H32M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004937/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jamie Foxx"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0350258/characters/nm0004937?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ray Charles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005093/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Regina King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0350258/characters/nm0005093?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Margie Hendricks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0502015/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Harry Lennix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0350258/characters/nm0502015?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Joe Adams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0254712/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Aunjanue Ellis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0350258/characters/nm0254712?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Ann Fisher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1468486/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "C.J.

(Sorry ladies!)\n\nI think there are some classic lines that have been overlooked: I remember when the Tractor went wild in Midvale, and Linda/Supergirl was searching for a place to change into her costume, she spied the Ladies' Room, and dashed toward it at super-speed, plowing into a woman who was just coming out. Linda apologized, \"Sorry, I'm in a rush!\" and shot inside. The woman looked wry. \"I know what you mean!\"\n\nPerhaps Zaltar (Peter O'Toole) wasn't as important as he could have been. Although I thought Faye Dunaway was perfect as Selena (a little type-casting courtesy of Mommie Dearest), I prefer to wonder what would have happened if Zaltar had been just a little more complex (he's an artist, after all!) and a little more selfish, and actually followed through with his plans to see Outer Space with the assistance of the Omegahedron.\n\nThen he might have been the villain of the piece, and the most dangerous kind of villain: the villain an audience can sympathize with. Then the audience would have been torn between wanting Zaltar to succeed, and wanting Kara/Supergirl to stop him before the loss of the Omegahedron destroys Argo City.\n\nOh! And I would've liked to see how Argo City was torn away more or less whole from Krypton as the planet detonated, and wound up in Inner Space, trapped in a warp that only Kal-El's little spaceship was equipped to navigate and exit.\n\nI don't think it's over for Supergirl, her story could be REtold (a la Batman), but I'd only be interested in a remake if the filmmakers would remain true to the style of THIS movie (Supergirl (1984), rather than opting for a trendy, dark, angst-ridden \"hero\" (I use the term loosely) in a demented action \"adventure\". I miss the bright, cheerful style of the old Superman comics, from the 50's, 60's and 70's, and I'd love to see that back on the big screen, like Superman The Movie and Superman II, and . . . naturally, Supergirl - The First Adventure.\n\nThis is a beautiful, dream-like jewel of a movie, a real Pink Panther (I refer, of course, to the diamond).\n\nThat breath-taking, emotional moment as Supergirl arrives on Earth, and discovers her powers and her new environment, in my humble opinion, is unmatched in all the Super-movies.\n\nJerry Goldsmith's score, especially the Supergirl March and the Love Theme are stirring and moving respectively, and easily equal to John Williams' contributions to the Superman movies. I have Jerry's score on CD (thanks to Silva Screen Records) and the Supergirl Main Theme is my Favorite Movie Theme of all time.\n\n (Superman was and is my hero, Superman II (1980) was THE defining movie of my youth, and I can probably sing you the entire score to Superman III, but I love the Supergirl themes more.)\n\nAnd if a widescreen, remastered version of this movie ever becomes available \"Down Under\" , I want to see it!"}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001159/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Faye Dunaway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0001159?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Selena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000564/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter O'Toole"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0000564?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zaltar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0882853/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brenda Vaccaro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0882853?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bianca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0911844/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Simon Ward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0911844?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Zor-El"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000952/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hart Bochner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0000952?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ethan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372242/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David Healy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0372242?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mr. Danvers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0541742/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Robyn Mandell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0541742?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Myra"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0723105/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Diana Ricardo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0723105?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Murray"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000644/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Helen Slater"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0000644?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Supergirl"}, {"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0000644?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Linda Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001201/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mia Farrow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0001201?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177228/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter Cook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0177228?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nigel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0566013/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Marc McClure"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0566013?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jimmy Olsen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0853808/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maureen Teefy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0853808?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lucy Lane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0225549/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sandra Dickinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0225549?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Pretty Young Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0484958/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jenifer Landor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088206/characters/nm0484958?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Muffy"}]}]}

A descendant of incredible lineage (all cousins to be exact) the daughter of the most ambitious Anne Boleyn, was in fact Henry VIII's best prodigy as a true and fair leader of England and its people. Henry could have wanted no more of her (nor seen better from a son) had he been able to witness Elizabeth's ability as Queen.\n\nGlenda Jackson is able to give us a view of Elizabeth as if it were Elizabeth herself we were watching; at least Elizabeth as we believe she would have been. True to the word of some of the critics within, no one really knows for certain what Elizabeth may have sounded like or for that matter the tenor in which spoke. But that matters little in this most true account of the Life of Elizabeth R. One takes what is portrayed by Glenda Jackson and the rest of the cast as the most likely of truths. After watching the full series, you will feel as though you were in court with Her Majesty, Elizabeth I.\n\nIf you haven't seen this you should.\n\nI loved this series growing up and after so many years of wanting to see it again, I have purchased my own copy of the series on DVD through Amazon.com.\n\nEnjoy!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413559/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Glenda Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0413559?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Queen Elizabeth I"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0362735/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Hardy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0362735?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester)"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0795344/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Shrapnel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0795344?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Earl of Sussex"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0255065/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Robin Ellis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0255065?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Robert Devereaux (Earl of Essex)"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447499/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rachel Kempson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0447499?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kat Ashley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0398032/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peter Howell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0398032?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lord Howard"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0385711/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ronald Hines"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0385711?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "William Cecil (Lord Burghley)"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0615278/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Stephen Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0615278?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Walsingham"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0861354/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Angela Thorne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0861354?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lettice Knollys, Lady Leicester"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420312/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter Jeffrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0420312?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "King Philip II of Spain"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 1971"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0681954/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Vivian Pickles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066652/characters/nm0681954?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 1971"}]}]}

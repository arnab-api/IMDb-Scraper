Sadly, Shadyac's 'Evan Almighty' only provides a few such moments. There just isn't enough comedy and at times it's a little too dramatic. Throughout the films, there are only but a very few dialogues that are funny as a result of which actors like Sykes and Graham don't have enough comedy to work with. Carell reprises his role from the prequel 'Bruce Almighty' but this time he's a little more of a nicer guy. Overall, Carell does a good job but he's more in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' mode which brings 'Evan Almighty' down a notch because that kind of character doesn't fully work for this kind of film and it is Shadyac to be blamed for not making something better of something decent. Yet, Carell's the only one who provides comic relief even though it's with limited quantity. His interaction with the animals are awesome to watch. Morgan Freeman is more cheerful and more annoying in this one. Lauren Graham plays the typical housewife and mother well and her reaction to Carell's transformation is excellent. In spite of all it's flaws, it is the last half hour that lifts the film. It builds up the drama and suspense very well and sort of has an adventurous feel. This entire sequence is very well executed. The soundtrack is well used and the songs are nice too. Thus, despite its shortcomings, it's still entertaining, but don't expect a laugh riot."}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0136797/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Carell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0413099/characters/nm0136797?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Evan Baxter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0334179/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lauren Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0413099/characters/nm0334179?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joan Baxter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1775177/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Graham Phillips"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0413099/characters/nm1775177?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jordan Baxter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000422/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Goodman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0413099/characters/nm0000422?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Congressman Long"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383422/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Michael Higgins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0413099/characters/nm0383422?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0788340/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Molly Shannon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0413099/characters/nm0788340?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Eve Adams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0126260/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "P.J.

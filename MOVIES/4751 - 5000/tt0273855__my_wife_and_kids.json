I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got his driver's license. If you want to know why, you'll have to have seen it for yourself. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2507259417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4YTVmZDktZDU4Zi00ODQxLWE1OGMtNTFhMmQyMDQ2ZDRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4YTVmZDktZDU4Zi00ODQxLWE1OGMtNTFhMmQyMDQ2ZDRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-18T22:45:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001834/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Damon Wayans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0273855/characters/nm0001834?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Kyle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "123 episodes, 2001-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0330719/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "George Gore II"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0273855/characters/nm0330719?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Kyle Jr."}, {"url": "#", "name": "123 episodes, 2001-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0293439/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jennifer Freeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0273855/characters/nm0293439?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Claire Kyle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 2001-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132896/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tisha Campbell-Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0273855/characters/nm0132896?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Janet 'Jay' Kyle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "123 episodes, 2001-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0571321/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Parker McKenna Posey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0273855/characters/nm0571321?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kady Kyle"}, {"url": "#", "name": "123 episodes, 2001-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1370821/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Noah Gray-Cabey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0273855/characters/nm1370821?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Franklin Aloysius Mumford"}, {"url": "#", "name": "60 episodes, 2002-2005"}]}]}

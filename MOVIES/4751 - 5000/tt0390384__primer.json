From their work in a small cottage industry of error checking devices they are forced to confront the fact that they have discovered something too valuable to market. As they explore the potential of their machine, they are caught in a frantic loop to second guess themselves.\n\nScience fiction in the cinema has largely been dominated by the visual impact, and so this is a welcome (for some) return to the world of ideas. This is not an easy-rise entertainment film but one where you have to concentrate to keep up, working out the logical implications of what's happening. If made on the scale of Men in Black or the Matrix it would descend to the level of spoof \u0096 as it is we follow the two main characters knowing that their actions are having momentous effects on the world around them and on themselves. Instead of flashy graphics, we are left to keep the ramifications of the story in mind as the characters themselves grapple with what they know is happening but can't even let themselves look at directly.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H17M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503403/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Shane Carruth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503403?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aaron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503463/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Casey Gooden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503463?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503468/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Carrie Crawford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503468?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503460/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Carruth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503460?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Man On Couch #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1518910/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ashley Warren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1518910?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hostess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503459/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chip Carruth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503459?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Thomas Granger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503465/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jack Pyland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503465?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Aaron's Co-worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503449/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ashok Upadhyaya"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503449?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Laboratory Technician"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503383/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Sullivan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503383?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Abe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0881420/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anand Upadhyaya"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm0881420?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Phillip"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503624/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jay Butler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503624?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Metalshop Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1508372/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Juan Tapia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1508372?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Man On Couch #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1439230/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Samantha Thomson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1439230?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rachel Granger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1894007/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Delaney Price"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1894007?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Laney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1503399/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Keith Bradshaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0390384/characters/nm1503399?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Clean Room Technician"}]}]}

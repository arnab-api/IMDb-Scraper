While more evidently it's small shaving blades that are how the myths grew, this film takes it to a much larger scale, then adds an extra hour and and half around it with a bunch of characters doing stuff before the climax.\n\nThe plot goes that a bunch of kids have graduated, and it's off to a water park with killer slides to celebrate. This and that happens and a bunch of interaction between a bunch of people and drama, drama, drama, sex, drugs, rock n roll (not very good rock tho, whoever the singer was in the band better not quit his day job) then a bit more drama, drama, drama, drugs, sex, sex, death, drama, drama, drama, Meatballs, death, death, bloodbath, wrapping up with an ending that attempts to be clever, but fails miserably.\n\nThe acting isn't that bad to be honest, it's a typical bunch of kids that are in every movie of this calibre. No need to name them. But it does become very predictable who will die first etc. There is however some odd choices of characters to introduce, making it seem like they where just added to expand the movie past it's only anticipated scenes. I can understand other reviewers saying it was boring waiting for the gory fun to begin, but meh, I wasn't bored at anytime during the movie, I just have no desire to ever watch it again now that I have.\n\nIf you're impatient and just wanna see the good bits, skip to the last ten minutes of the movie. Afterwards, you'll most likely think how unrealistic the attempt at suspence and dumb characters with no common sense makes it feel unbelievable as it throws logic and realism out the window, then be disappointed and feel no need to watch the whole thing with the terrible final 2 minutes and the even worse after-credits scene.\n\nOverall, if the plot and synopsis interests you, it's ok for one viewing, just don't expect a masterpiece or must see cinematography, but know it's not filmed like a bad B-grade indie flick or anything, the production is pretty good.... oh, and don't expect comedy. It doesn't really have any, except for those like me who laugh at gore scenes lol.\n\nMake up your own mind if you wanna see it or not? But you're not missing out on much if you never see it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H11M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Aquaslash", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi99401497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA0NWRkNWQtNWEwMy00ZWYwLTk2NzktNzA0MTQ1YWRjOTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA0NWRkNWQtNWEwMy00ZWYwLTk2NzktNzA0MTQ1YWRjOTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-10-30T17:05:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2322312/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicolas Fontaine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7286836/characters/nm2322312?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Josh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3325769/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nick Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7286836/characters/nm3325769?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paul Wilkinson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5111584/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paul Zinno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7286836/characters/nm5111584?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0742694/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "HoJo Rose"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7286836/characters/nm0742694?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Randall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7772469/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cameron Geller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt7286836/characters/nm7772469?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9315340/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ivan D.

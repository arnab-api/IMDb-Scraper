Levi & Nia...The kid playing that part is really not a very good actor I think they should have gotten some one a little more talented and he's NOT Funny. My biggest Complaint is that Sickening Fake, Talentless Falsetto Speaking Nia/Navia Robinson!! Not sure why they have her character being so WEIRD but I Simply Can NOT Stand LOOKING at her or Listening to her voice all of the sudden this season she started speaking in that monotone falsetto deep emotionless voice. I hate the way she tries to interfere in Tess's relationship ( especially the X-mas episode with Ramon's gift for Tess). She has this air about her that she thinks sh'e better than Booker ( he's really a GREAT Actor) I could go on & On... they should some how get rid of her character. Have her her go live with her Dad in Texas... or re-cast the part....just an idea, Also why are they powdering her up so much? she looks like a odd colored ghost... She Really Really Really is messing up the show . I DVR the show just so I FF the parts she's in. Raven & Chelsea are X-cellent as ever...Disney you really need to listen up!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Raven's Home", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi945863961", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcxZmMxNjAtNTRiNy00ODliLThhOWQtYTI0NGM3MmE3MWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcxZmMxNjAtNTRiNy00ODliLThhOWQtYTI0NGM3MmE3MWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Raven's Home", "uploadDate": "2019-04-13T20:03:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0712368/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Raven-Symon\u00e9"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6311972/characters/nm0712368?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Raven Baxter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6221146/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Navia Ziraili Robinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6311972/characters/nm6221146?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nia Baxter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8881548/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sky Katz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6311972/characters/nm8881548?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tess O'Malley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5705377/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Issac Ryan Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6311972/characters/nm5705377?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Booker Baxter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7216770/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jason Maybaum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6311972/characters/nm7216770?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Levi Grayson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1156809/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anneliese van der Pol"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6311972/characters/nm1156809?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chelsea Grayson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2017-2021"}]}]}

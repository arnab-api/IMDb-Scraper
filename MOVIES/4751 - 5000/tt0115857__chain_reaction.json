"name": "enjoyable", "reviewBody": "After viewing this film on homevideo,i decided for myself that this fugitive style film was worth adding into my personal collection of fun films.All action nuts should get a kick out of chain reaction mainly because this is what the film was made for and not to be correct in all of what goes on.Keanu reaves is a student machinist at a chicago university who is working with a genius of a professor that is finding a way to extract energy from plain water thru process of hydrogen.Keanu finds the frequency that makes the process work by mistake one night at home.After having a small celebration back at the university,he escorts his tipsy assistant Rachel Weise back to her apartment,but like the gentleman he is,he dosent take advantage of her and puts her to bed.Once he returns back to the building where the experiments were conducted,he finds utter chaos with the professor dead(suffocated) and the hydrogen machine going haywire.He finds a explosive device ready to go off at any minute,so keanu bolts away and heads for his motocycle.After only getting a few miles away,the bomb is detonated and takes out five city blocks in the process.Naturally,since he was the last one at the scene,Keanu is the prime suspect in the sabotage case.His only allies are now Rachel Weise and the mysterious business man portrayed by Morgan Freeman who no one can figure out which side he is really on Purist and filmstudents could pick this film apart as they usually do by noting a few continuity glitches and questioning how keanu could survive the explosion that took out five city blocks,but if he were to perish then and there folks,there could be no further development and the film ends there.Keep in mind this was made for the action buff and you wont mind the few glitches that occur in this film which i deem quite enjoyable by all but the picky few who dont really watch films for enjoyment and escapism.", "reviewRating":

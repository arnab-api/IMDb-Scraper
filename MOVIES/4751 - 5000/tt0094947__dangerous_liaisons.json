But\n\neven if all that aside, this still does not explain lack of character\n\ndevelopment, lack of emotional charge through the movie and lack\n\nof French manners and ways of life that should be a background to\n\nany movie set in France. Who ever hoots in a theater in France?\n\nWhat music teacher (not that he is a music teacher in a book)\n\ncould challenge a nobleman? What about just the general charm\n\nand etiquette of French nobility that despite all of their wickedness\n\nis still the predominant mask? Where was that? Perhaps John\n\nMalkovich was the wrong actor to try to display a combination of a\n\nseducer and a charmer all at the same time. As far as Michelle\n\nPfeiffer, well she is beautiful as always and she fit the role she\n\nwas given..her typical role. The virtuous, sweet woman who tries to\n\ncontrol things but fails. This is her role in every single movie she is\n\nin and she is good in that role, but unfortunately does not go any\n\nfurther in developing it. Keeanu Reeves is terrible and\n\nundeveloped as a character and I can't believe the only point of\n\nUma Thurman was for the nudity. I mean she can act and they\n\ncould have made her into a stronger character to illustrate all the\n\nemotions and changes she had to go through. As far as Glenn\n\nClose, I also thought that the emotional load of the movie, of her\n\ncharacter was not passed on to the viewer because of her weak\n\nperformance or weak writing. This movie could of been great if\n\nmade by the French who could not only understand the novel\n\nbetter but also allow the viewers to taste France and that time\n\nperiod in all its beauty and bitterness. To make people feel the\n\nfunction of women as victims and at the same time see that not all\n\nwas quite that simple. This movie was made in two dimensions\n\nand it needed at least one more in order to live up to the novel.\n\nHowever, it turned out to be a typical, wanna be Blockbuster flick\n\nwith a little bit more of an interesting story line."}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2987048473", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEwYzJkOTgtNmQ4My00YjhmLTg0MWItYTAxYzM4OGIzYTE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDEwYzJkOTgtNmQ4My00YjhmLTg0MWItYTAxYzM4OGIzYTE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-13T10:44:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000335/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Glenn Close"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0000335?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Marquise de Merteuil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000201/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michelle Pfeiffer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0000201?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Madame de Tourvel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000206/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Keanu Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0000206?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chevalier Danceny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000235/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Uma Thurman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0000235?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "C\u00e9cile de Volanges"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0792189/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joe Sheridan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0792189?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Georges"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0072556/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Laura Benson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0072556?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Emilie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0370444/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nicholas Hawtrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0370444?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Major-domo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0482349/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Lalande"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0482349?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cur\u00e9"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000518/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Malkovich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0000518?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Vicomte de Valmont"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001436/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Swoosie Kurtz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0001436?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Madame de Volanges"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0622450/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mildred Natwick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0622450?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Madame de Rosemonde"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0134922/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter Capaldi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0134922?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Azolan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324636/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Valerie Gogan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0324636?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Julie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0667744/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joanna Pavlis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0667744?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ad\u00e8le"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0229472/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Paulo Abel Do Nascimento"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094947/characters/nm0229472?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Castrato"}]}]}

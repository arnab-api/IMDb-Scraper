It's a wonderful series for both mystery and romance.\n\nJonathan and Jennnifer Hart are a pair of engaging amateur detectives. The dashing Jonathan is a self made millionaire and CEO of his company, Hart Industries. His gorgeous wife, Jennifer, has had her own career as a freelance journalist. Now much of their time is spent globe trotting and acting as amateur sleuths, investigating with apparent ease cases of murder, theft, and espionage. Apart from that, they enjoy their mansion home, the company of their loyal butler, Max, and their cute little dog, Freeway.\n\nThe two stars have a great on screen chemistry. Robert Wagner brings charm and charisma to the role of Jonathan Hart, and the beautiful Stephanie Powers is perfect as his wife, Jennifer. Lionel Stander portrays to perfection Max, the couple's butler, cook, and chauffeur, who is very proud of his employers and valiantly tries to keep their lives sorted out for them.\n\nThe glamorous couple's jet setting lifestyle and assorted encounters with danger & intrigue make for an engaging program. As with all amateur sleuths, murder follows these two wherever they journey. However, it's their constant flirting and loving banter that make the show. These two literally can't seem to get enough of each other! How refreshing to witness a married couple so obviously in love. Although they enjoy the luxurious benefits of Jonathan's wealth, they seem to be a pair with their priorities straight in life.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hart to Hart", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1173995289", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzExOGQ1NWMtMWZlNy00MzhhLWJkZDUtYzczMzUwMGY0NTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzExOGQ1NWMtMWZlNy00MzhhLWJkZDUtYzczMzUwMGY0NTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2019-10-16T17:08:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001822/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Wagner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078622/characters/nm0001822?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jonathan Hart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1979-1984"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822034/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lionel Stander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078622/characters/nm0822034?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Max"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1979-1984"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0694619/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stefanie Powers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078622/characters/nm0694619?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jennifer Hart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1979-1984"}]}]}

Kevin Sorbo and Michael Hurst are just phenomenal together. If you have never seen this series, I feel you are truly missing out. Not only is it great fun, but you can also watch how Hercules and Iolaus grow as characters/people throughout the series, which adds to the sincerity of the characters. A lot of people complain/have complained about the anachronisms and the mixing of historical timelines in this series, but they obviously have a stick up their bum. Firstly, this series never in any way stated that it was going to be 100% historically accurate. In fact, this series would be more accurately categorized as 'historical fiction'--historical fiction is a story that is based around allegedly true events, but with an artistic or creative interpretation or spin. At any rate, you shouldn't be taking this series so seriously that you can't have fun watching it.

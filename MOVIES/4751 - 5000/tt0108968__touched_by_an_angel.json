Some would be turned away by the message-heavy show, while others would like it for its likeable characters and family-friendly stories. I've never watched it on a weekly basis, but I have seen a good deal of episodes, and I enjoy it. I'm not a very religious person, but I can view it as a pleasant show with a lot of heart, good acting, and good storytelling. Of course, one of the reasons I like it is because of Roma Downey, whose beauty (and that beautiful voice) can make even the most slow-paced episodes enjoyable. There's no car chases or shootouts here, so some episodes do tend to be a little slow, but for those who like it, ultimately rewarding. There's obviously a good amount of chemistry between the three stars, and as I said, the stories are very family-friendly, often dealing with issues everyone can relate to. This is a show parents could feel comfortable with letting their kids watch alone. If today's kids could accept a show with more talk than action. I'm still surprised this show is still on. Shows this simple and nice usually tend to disappear immediately. I bet if the show had debuted within the past two or three years, it would have been gone before the fifth episode probably. I suspect it's got another season or two left. It's had a good run, so I would hope the show ends while it's still a good show."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Touched By An Angel: Holiday Spirit", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3671309593", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzliNmQzMWMtNGE2Yy00OGFjLWIzYTEtOTQ1ZTFjMjEwY2U4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzliNmQzMWMtNGE2Yy00OGFjLWIzYTEtOTQ1ZTFjMjEwY2U4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Touched By An Angel: Holiday Spirit", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T08:30:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004884/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Roma Downey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108968/characters/nm0004884?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Monica"}, {"url": "#", "name": "211 episodes, 1994-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004891/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Dye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108968/characters/nm0004891?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Andrew"}, {"url": "#", "name": "188 episodes, 1996-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005343/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Della Reese"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108968/characters/nm0005343?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tess"}, {"url": "#", "name": "211 episodes, 1994-2003"}]}]}

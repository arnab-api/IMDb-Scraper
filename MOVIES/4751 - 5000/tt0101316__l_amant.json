The characters are perfect and acted in a minimalist way that's refreshing.\n\nI see here that the main objections to this film are: 1 .. Not enough character development 2 .. The film does not have a clear direction to where it's going 3 .. Too slow 4 .. Too much sex (for some people if a film has explicit sex it can't be good)\n\nAll these objections are pointless:\n\n1 .. The characters here are ordinary people, not that interesting by themselves. It's the love story that's interesting. Both of them know they have no future and try to pretend it's not love. I am sick of films in which the characters are sure they love each other after 30 minutes of \"character development\".\n\n2 .. The fact that this film does not follow a clear path it's one of it's qualities. It adds more drama and the characters themselves are confused and don't know where they're going. The whole film plays like a dream of love and to request \"clear direction\" it's pointless.\n\n3 .. Ahh! The \"too slow\" argument. There are films in this world that make you think about you, your life and the world that's around you. Surely you need some TIME to reflect on that. Short attention-span is a bad thing :).\n\n4 .. This film is about love. The fact that they are shown having sex makes them real persons, with real bodies not some film characters. Sex is an escape from the world around them and I don't think it's too much, too explicit or some nonsense like that. It's so hard to have a film with sex it it that's not trivial! This is a masterpiece by this fact alone.\n\nThe persons who \"though up\" these arguments took the main strengths of the film and complained about them. This for me it's proof enough that they didn't understand this film or that the film didn't struck a single chord in their soul. Short attention span is the main plague of films now and the lack of it is the reason the french make such great films! Please try to see it again and not in a hurry. It's not light cinema! It's great cinema!"}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Lover", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1368719641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJhODExOTUtMDNmYS00YzQ0LWE4MzQtMWY2YTNiMmE5YWQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJhODExOTUtMDNmYS00YzQ0LWE4MzQtMWY2YTNiMmE5YWQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from MGM", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:57:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001506/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jane March"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0001506?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "The Young Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0576928/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Meininger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0576928?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "The Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0693799/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Melvil Poupaud"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0693799?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "The Younger Brother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0542091/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Xiem Mang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0542091?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "The Chinaman's Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0770301/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ann Schaufuss"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0770301?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Anne-Marie Stretter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0868477/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tania Torrens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0868477?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "The Principal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935043/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Yvonne Wingerter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0935043?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "The Writer (beginning)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0665269/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Patarot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0665269?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "The Assistant Mistress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0504899/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tony Ka Fai Leung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0504899?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "The Chinaman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0320481/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Arnaud Giovaninetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0320481?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "The Elder Brother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269096/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lisa Faulkner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0269096?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Helene Lagonelle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0494231/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Philippe Le Dem"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0494231?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "The French Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0885595/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Quach Van An"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0885595?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "The Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0381821/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Raymonde Heudeline"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0381821?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "The Writer (end)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0896737/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Do Minh Vien"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101316/characters/nm0896737?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "The Young Boy"}]}]}

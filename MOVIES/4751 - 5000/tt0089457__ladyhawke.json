What I loved about this film is that even though it's a wonderful mixture of action, adventure, romance and comedy, it is a simple film. The execution is solid and it shows that Donner and his cast and crew have put a lot of heart in the making of the film.\n\nThe score is kind of funny. At times there's a beautiful symphony that expresses the beauty of the settings and then, during the action scenes, there's the typical 80's hip track which brings a smile as it nostalgically reminds me of that wild decade. 'Ladyhawke' is indeed very beautiful to look at. The cinematography is superb as it gives a very spacious view and the composition of the shots are very well arranged.\n\nNo CGI has been used and that marvelously stands out as it gives the film a purer look and only reminds one of the days before CGI was overused, when cinema looked pure and authentic. 'Ladyhawke' is a fine example of movies that can look great and sometimes even better and more effective without CGI (other examples being the Star Wars trilogy (80's version), Indiana Jones etc).\n\nThe performances are topnotch. A radiant Michelle Pfeiffer completely owns the title role. Her understated performance and quiet yet strong presence (like a hawk) brilliantly contrasts Rutger Hauer's wolfish character. Hauer too does a fine job. An evil Alfred Molino is barely recognizable and Leo McKern wears the menacing look very well. John Wood provides some great comic relief. However, it is Matthew Broderick who stands out. He performs naturally as the vivacious, energetic, deceitful thief who loses his heart to Ladyhawke and at the same time he is determined to reunite the lovers and rescue them from the wrath of the curse.\n\nOverall, 'Ladyhawke' is a beautiful movie that satisfied my filmviewing experience. It gives that nostalgic feel, it amuses, it fascinates and it feels enchanting. No wonder it still feels fresh after more than two decades."}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Ladyhawke", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1804910105", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU4Yzg5N2UtNzY4Mi00MmVkLWI4OWQtYWMzMzRmNzNmMmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTU4Yzg5N2UtNzY4Mi00MmVkLWI4OWQtYWMzMzRmNzNmMmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-03-20T17:02:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000111/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matthew Broderick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0000111?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gaston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000201/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michelle Pfeiffer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0000201?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Isabeau"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0939795/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0939795?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bishop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000547/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alfred Molina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0000547?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cezar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230130/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Loris Loddi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0230130?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jehan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0097391/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Charles Borromel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0097391?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Insane Prisoner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0660437/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nicolina Papetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0660437?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mrs. Pitou"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388342/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Donald Hodson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0388342?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Guard on Cart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000442/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rutger Hauer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0000442?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Navarre"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0571674/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Leo McKern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0571674?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Imperius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0404455/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ken Hutchison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0404455?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marquet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0307752/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Giancarlo Prete"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0307752?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Fornac"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785360/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alex Serra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0785360?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mr. Pitou"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0764936/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Massimo Sarchielli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0764936?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Innkeeper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0143258/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Russel Case"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089457/characters/nm0143258?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lieutenant"}]}]}

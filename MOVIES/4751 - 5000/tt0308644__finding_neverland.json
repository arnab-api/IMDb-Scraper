That being said, I felt that this movie was by far one of the most touching and entertaining movies I have seen in my short 22 years. The cast is fabulous, every actor plays his/her part so to speak. \n\nThe story centers around J. M. Barrie, creator of Peter Pan, and his journey to writing the well-known play. It highlights his genius, while also showing the painful isolation that comes with being a mind ahead of your time. There are some liberties taken when put against the actual events that led up to the birth of Peter Pan, but don't let this dissuade you from watching--\"Finding Neverland\" was never slated as being a documentary! \n\nBeing a huge Johnny Depp fan, one would think that my judgment would be tainted by his involvement in the film. However, even I can admit to a failed Depp movie (i.e. The Secret Window). At first, I thought that putting Depp outside of his usual character type, a mildly strange pirate/writer/doctor/investigator/man with scissors for hands, might signify a substandard film. Boy was I wrong! He nailed J.M. Barrie and was absolutely captivating throughout the entire film. I hate to sound like a starry-eyed fan but I thought his performance in this movie was downright Oscar-worthy! \n\nDepp is magnificent, but he does not carry the weight of this film on his own. A slue of other fine actors and actresses, Kate Winslet and Freddy Highmore just to name a few, give absolutely divine performances. Do yourself a favor, shell out the eight bucks and go see this movie!"}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Finding Neverland", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi955227673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2YyMmQyZmEtYThmOS00NjM3LWFiYmYtMjY1NDFhMDk5MDRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2YyMmQyZmEtYThmOS00NjM3LWFiYmYtMjY1NDFhMDk5MDRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:21:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sir James Matthew Barrie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001046/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julie Christie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0001046?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mrs. Emma du Maurier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000163/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dustin Hoffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0000163?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charles Frohman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0698789/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joe Prospero"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0698789?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jack Llewelyn Davies"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1324324/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Luke Spill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm1324324?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michael Llewelyn Davies"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0531808/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kelly Macdonald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0531808?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "'Peter Pan'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1169742/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Eileen Essell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm1169742?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mrs. Snow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0289173/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Oliver Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0289173?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gilbert Cannan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000701/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate Winslet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0000701?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sylvia Llewelyn Davies"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0593664/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Radha Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0593664?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mary Ansell Barrie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383603/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Freddie Highmore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0383603?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter Llewelyn Davies"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1133783/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nick Roud"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm1133783?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "George Llewelyn Davies"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001324/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ian Hart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0001324?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0188871/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mackenzie Crook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0188871?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mr. Jaspers - Usher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0306977/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jimmy Gardner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0308644/characters/nm0306977?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mr. Snow"}]}]}

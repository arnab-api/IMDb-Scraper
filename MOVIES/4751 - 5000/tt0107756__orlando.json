It is sometimes irritating,partly because it refuses to answer so many questions it poses- for instance does Orlando actually travel forward in time in some scenes,or is it just time passing? Why does one other character,the Archduke Harry,also seem to live for ages? Some of the film's touches,such as Orlando's addresses to camera,do come across as a little pretentious. Even considering the short running time,the pace is at times extremely slow,but that is not always a bad thing. Those in search of an original film experience which provides plenty to talk about after could do far worse,and the film actually becomes more rewarding the more one sees it,because you can put up with the flaws and concentrate on the many remarkable things about this film.\n\nThe film is absolutely gorgeous to look at,so many shots look like they could be great paintings. The film has a unique atmosphere,as it passes through the centuries,it creates a highly stylized,almost fairytale-like view of the past-this is especially successful in the early Elizabethan scenes set around snow. Here there is a terrific sense of a world that may have existed only in Orlando's distant memory,although it must be said the low budget does often show. There is plenty of humor that becomes funnier with repeated viewings-how about the overwrought Victorian melodrama of the meeting between Orlando and Billy Zane's character? The film is also quite erotic in a subtle way that is hard to explain,but it's there.\n\nAnd of course there is the unique Tilda Swinton-she may have become a star recently with The Chronicles of Narnia,but this is her defining role. No other film has used best her striking appearance,and her casual reaction to the things that happen to her,such as going to sleep as a man and waking up as a woman,provides some of the film's best moments.Of the other performances,Quentin Crisp is unforgettable in the early scenes as a really decrepit Queen Elizabeth,although Billy Zane,as usual,is somewhat wooden.\n\nVirgnia Woolf's novel probably seems completely unfilmable to most people after they have read it,but this film does a great job of simplifying it and yet still retaining the essence. Whether you consider the film {as the novel is}a feminist tract,or just a very strange fantasy,it can be extremely rewarding if you have the patience for something that is at times as offbeat as they come. I should add here that this is now probably one of my favourite films,but I certainly didn't feel like that about it when I first saw it many years ago."}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Orlando", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1520369945", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkxNmQ2YTEtYjRiYS00NjAxLTk0ZmEtZDRlODcwYzZkZWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDkxNmQ2YTEtYjRiYS00NjAxLTk0ZmEtZDRlODcwYzZkZWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Sony Pictures Classics", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:33:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0842770/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tilda Swinton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0842770?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Orlando"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0813896/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jimmy Somerville"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0813896?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Falsetto"}, {"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0813896?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Angel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0051993/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Elaine Banham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0051993?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Orlando's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0537845/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sara Mair-Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0537845?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Favilla"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0840303/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dudley Sutton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0840303?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "King James I"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0799252/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Matthew Sim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0799252?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lord Francis Vere"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0826779/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Viktor Stepanov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0826779?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Russian Ambassador"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0533920/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mary MacLeod"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0533920?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "First Older Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0187998/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Quentin Crisp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0187998?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Queen Elizabeth I"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0098614/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John Bott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0098614?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Orlando's Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267926/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anna Farnworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0267926?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Clorinda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372293/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Anna Healy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0372293?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Euphrosyne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0750971/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Simon Russell Beale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0750971?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Earl of Moray"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932361/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jerome Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0932361?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Translator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0883484/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Charlotte Valandrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107756/characters/nm0883484?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Princess Sasha"}]}]}

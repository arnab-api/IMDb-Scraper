It's obedience and entertainment by those who rebel, no matter how insane they are. The exploitation of those in peril for any kind of economic profit. And the fact that everything Beale preaches is completely true and completely bashes the people who are producing him. I was amazed by how much he sells out while continuing to rant about how terrible the people he works for are, and the fact that they just keep him on the air because they want ratings.\n\nIt couldn't be more related to today. Turn on the news and you see videos of how horrific the war on terror is and how horrific American society has become, but it stays on the air because people don't want to see the good things in life. They care about the bad and the corrupt. People must have laughed it off back then, but it was such a foreshadow to the near future. The performances are just as brilliant as the social commentary. Each actor becomes so absorbed into their characters that you can't even tell they're acting. It feels like you're watching these people in their daily lives, interacting and becoming more and more corrupt. Finch and Dunaway easily give two of the greatest performances of all time. I could write 20 more pages about it's brilliance, but I'll stop now to keep me from rating. I just have to say that it's so rare to find a film as incredibly flawless as this.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2333982233", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGZhZWE0MWUtMWVkZS00YWJjLWIzZGItNzNlNjY4M2JlMzhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGZhZWE0MWUtMWVkZS00YWJjLWIzZGItNzNlNjY4M2JlMzhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-02T17:47:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001159/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Faye Dunaway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074958/characters/nm0001159?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Diana Christensen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002075/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter Finch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074958/characters/nm0002075?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Howard Beale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011741/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wesley Addy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074958/characters/nm0011741?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nelson Chaney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121386/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Arthur Burghardt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074958/characters/nm0121386?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Great Ahmed Kahn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0139380/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Carpenter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074958/characters/nm0139380?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "George Bosch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0188829/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kathy Cronkite"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074958/characters/nm0188829?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mary Ann Gifford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0218731/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jerome Dempsey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0074958/characters/nm0218731?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Walter C.

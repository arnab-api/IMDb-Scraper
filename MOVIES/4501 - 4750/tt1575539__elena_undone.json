It is well written, acted and directed. I was very pleased with the storyline and the outcome of the struggles that the two women face and endure. There was an obvious chemistry between the two main characters. The attractions were well played out and meaningful. Very romantic. I loved it. \n\nThe attraction between the confirmed Lesbian and the married woman is so inevitable. I enjoyed the obvious and subtle suggestions. It reminded me of my own experiences. The relationship between the two women slowly develops. It is not rushed. Thankfully, we don't have to wait for the end of the film to observe the attraction and how the women act upon it. This is a positive LGBT film that should be experienced by Gay, straight, or whatever floats your boat individuals. It is important to see that the two women are open to their relationship - whether it remain as a friendship as it starts or continue down the path of deeper and physical love.\n\nI am very pleased that this film was made. There was a good amount of sensuality that is missing from so many LGBT and other romantic films. Nicole Conn is very good with the writing and directing. Thank goodness for Nicole Conn! I also loved the main characters. Kudos to all who made the film possible!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Elena Undone", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2754977305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGE4ZjQxOGYtZDA3ZS00ZDQ0LTgxM2YtNTU4ZjI1YWU1NDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGE4ZjQxOGYtZDA3ZS00ZDQ0LTgxM2YtNTU4ZjI1YWU1NDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Elena Undone", "uploadDate": "2011-11-07T06:18:01Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2464261/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Necar Zadegan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm2464261?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0917314/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gary Weeks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm0917314?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Barry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3159225/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Connor Kramme"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm3159225?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3310501/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Jane Wells"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm3310501?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Wave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2829362/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Heather Howe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm2829362?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164053/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jane Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm0164053?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peyton's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3574485/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mayank Bhatter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm3574485?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ari"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1728229/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Skyler Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm1728229?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jackie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0227867/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Thunderbird Dinwiddie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm0227867?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Peyton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0365293/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sam Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm0365293?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tyler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1336886/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sabrina Carmen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm1336886?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tori"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0142246/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Erin Carufel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm0142246?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Millie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3618685/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shyloh Oostwald"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm3618685?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Young Peyton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0451046/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robert Khakh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm0451046?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rasheed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0133047/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Catherine Campion"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1575539/characters/nm0133047?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Amelia"}]}]}

They're a little bit larger than life in this classic comic, but who cares! For any father who loves his daughter, this movie simply can't be watched without feeling a tearing at the heart and a lump in the throat. Father of The Bride can be viewed purely as a bit of light-hearted comedy that mocks the way Dads can sometimes be, but by looking just a little deeper, it contains valuable information that could help many a daughter understand her Dad, and offers many a Dad some consolation that he is not alone, and that someone out there understands the separation pains he is going through as his most precious treasure begins to spread her wings and look elsewhere than the first man she ever loved. This is a tough time for many fathers, and mothers and daughters very often don't understand their erratic, paranoid and irrational behaviour. Father of The Bride explores this phenomenon with what was for me an amazingly accurate depiction of the emotional turmoil that goes on in the head of a man who cherishes his daughter's love and feels threatened and reduntant when another man enters the picture. Goodrich and Hackett have constructed it brilliantly, and Steve Martin expresses it perfectly in this most elegant of love stories. The movie takes some shortcuts - for most of us, the separation pains don't do us the courtesy of waiting till the engagement - they come much earlier than that, when out of the blue some stranger comes into our daughter's life. Martin demonstrates the pain and fear and anxiety that every daughter's Dad feels as some blow-in comes and lays a claim on his beloved child. A must for every Dad with a teen princess, and for the Mums and Daughters I strongly recommend that instead of just laughing and saying \"hahahah - that's Dad all over\", read between the lines to see just why Dad is the way he is. Loved it every time I've seen it (3 or 4 times now)."}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi673103385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU4YmMzMjgtMTlkMS00OWM0LWI3YjctNTVlNTkzNTllZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU4YmMzMjgtMTlkMS00OWM0LWI3YjctNTVlNTkzNTllZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "With his oldest daughter's wedding approaching, a father finds himself reluctant to let go.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-03T10:41:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000188/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0000188?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Banks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931090/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kimberly Williams-Paisley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0931090?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Annie Banks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0627624/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "George Newbern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0627624?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bryan MacKenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000703/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "BD Wong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0000703?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Howard Weinstein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0570033/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kate McGregor-Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0570033?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joanna MacKenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0651074/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "April Ortiz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0651074?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Olivia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0104462/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gibby Brand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0104462?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0674977/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Barbara Perry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0674977?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Female Factory Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000473/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Diane Keaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0000473?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nina Banks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001085/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kieran Culkin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0001085?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Matty Banks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001737/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Martin Short"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0001737?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Franck Eggelhoffer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324533/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter Michael Goetz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0324533?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "John MacKenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0371714/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Carmen Hayward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0371714?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Grace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0890705/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mina Vasquez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0890705?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Marta"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0692466/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Richard Portnow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101862/characters/nm0692466?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Al - the Tux Salesman"}]}]}

And today it was sadly made official, we won't be getting a second season, such a shame, all fans of the comic know what would have been coming in the next season with the \"die for me\" arc. But not like it can be change, we have the one season to enjoy and at the very least we have the comics.\n\nIf you haven't read the comics I would strongly recommend, especially if you enjoyed the show.\n\nAlthough the show has been cancelled I would recommend people to check it out, it seemed to be received well with critics, and viewer numbers weren't bad, it was never meant to be a mainstream show, I don't expect it to be a show for everyone.\n\nIf you want some fun, bit of change from mainstream tv shows, this is worth checking out.\n\nThe overall feel to the show was interesting, I loved the way it was filmed, the Vegas episode was a great take on fear and loathing, and overall was fairly close to the comic, with a couple changes here and there for tv reasons to fill out 10 episodes. So go check it out enjoy, and maybe check out the comic to.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3170089497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzZmZjhlMjgtOWY4Yy00ZDUyLTkxZTYtMGM5NjM1YzUyNDEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzZmZjhlMjgtOWY4Yy00ZDUyLTkxZTYtMGM5NjM1YzUyNDEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Marcus (Benjamin Wadsworth), a teen living on the streets, is recruited into Kings Dominion, an elite private academy where the world's top crime families send their next generations.

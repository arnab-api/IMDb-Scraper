I love everything about this show. I was leery at first from the commercials, but after watching the first episode I could not stop laughing the whole time. Very low energy humor but just incredibly funny in the situations. The conversations are too awkward and ridiculous not to be funny. I showed it to many friends who also loved it. So far this might be the funniest new show on TV. Despite the ridiculousness, some of the ideas are actually pretty good in their own right. I think this show is pretty original, and a great parody of the business marketing TV shows. This is something I personally have been waiting for, its simple, clever, and a satirical comment about American business culture, but with genuine brilliance behind the hilarity. I think Nathan is a genius, and I really hope this show doesn't get canceled like another comment said. I would love to see it continue, but comedy central does love their one season hilarious shows. Hopefully they learn early on that this is a great one and keep it going. The world needs more Nathan.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1884926745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg1NTY2NTk2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg1NTY2NTk2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the Season 3 trailer for \"Nathan for You.\"", "uploadDate": "2015-10-11T19:15:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2358709/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nathan Fielder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2297757/characters/nm2358709?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nathan Fielder"}, {"url": "#", "name": "32 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}]}

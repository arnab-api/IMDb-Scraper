After all, the fact that a movie series can hold the public's interest for 21 years (and nine films) and that the whole Star Trek concept is alive and well after over 30 years says something about the genius of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek's creator.\n\nPeople seem to cricitize this film heavily.  Some of the criticisms of the film that I have heard in my discussions with people include phrases such as \"frightfully boring,\" \"way too long,\" and \"chronically lacking in action.\" However, if that is all you saw in the film, then you clearly missed out on the film's beauty.  This film is not about guns, explosions, blood, or machismo.  It is about the philosophical relationship between logic and emotion.\n\nThe film is masterfully directed by Robert Wise, the academy award winning director of \"The Sound of Music.\"  The film reunites the original cast of the Star Trek series with a few new faces ... Stephen Collins as \"Capt. Decker\" and Persis Khambata as \"Lt. Ilia\".  It also recaps the events that have transpired in each original series character since the television series in the late 60's with a sensitivity to newcomers to the Star Trek universe.  It effectively introduces newcomers to Star Trek without insulting the intelligence of those of us who are thoroughly familiar with Star Trek.\n\nThe plot features an intelligent, logical entity that calls itself VGER. VGER is an innocent entity with one mission ... \"learn all that is learnable... transmit that information to the creator.\"  VGER in its incredible journey has in essence gained knowledge that spans the very essence of the universe.  VGER now has set a course for Earth in an attempt to share its knowledge with its creator.  VGER believes that its creator is on Earth.\n\nVGER becomes a threat to life on Earth when its destroys three Klignon vessels and a Federation space station with incredible destructive power. To counter this threat, Admiral Kirk takes command of the Enterprise and leads the Enterprise in an intriguing battle with this alien entity.\n\nWhile battling this alien entity, Admiral Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew learn about the relationship between human logic and emotion.  They explore philosophical issues such as \"Is this all that I am?\" and \"Is there nothing more?\".  I believe Spock summarizes the quest for answers to these questions by his statement about two-thirds of the way into the film that indicates that \"logic alone is not enough\".  They eventually learn to appreciate the unique attributes that make us human ... \"our weaknesses ... and the drive that compels us to overcome them.\"\n\nIn conclusion, this film has a great plot, great special effects, and excellent music and cinematography.  Definitely see it if you are truly interested in taking a philosophical journey into the essence of what makes us human.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H12M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3331522841", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ0OTI2YWItMDllZi00ZWZlLTlkZDgtZmU2M2QxNDVkYWRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ0OTI2YWItMDllZi00ZWZlLTlkZDgtZmU2M2QxNDVkYWRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:53:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000638/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William Shatner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079945/characters/nm0000638?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Capt.

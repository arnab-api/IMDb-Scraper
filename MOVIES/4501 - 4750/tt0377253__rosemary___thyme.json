With such seasoned veterans as it's main stars, both ladies never disappoint. With a touch of warmth, Rosemary & Thyme rate with the staples from Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. While the mysteries may not be as involved, both ladies help work through the mystery, while making you feel as part of the team. With this show, I have to say you never are left wondering about the obvious clue you missed, because you experience everything with them as they experience it. There's no hidden brother's cousin's sister who arrives five minutes before the murder and leaves and is discovered at the end. The viewer is treated to background mini-dramas of both character's past relationships and lives as they delve in the murder afoot. This series is definitely worth watching and in my opinion worth buying."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Rosemary & Thyme: Season 3-Vol. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi159956249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJiY2IzNTYtNWMyOS00ZWM0LTg5NjgtODNkMDU5MGRjNGVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJiY2IzNTYtNWMyOS00ZWM0LTg5NjgtODNkMDU5MGRjNGVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Rosemary & Thyme: Season 3-Vol. 1", "uploadDate": "2019-03-18T06:08:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447555/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Felicity Kendal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0377253/characters/nm0447555?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rosemary Boxer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 2003-2006"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0274913/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pam Ferris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0377253/characters/nm0274913?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laura Thyme"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 2003-2006"}]}]}

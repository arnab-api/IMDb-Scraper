High hopes for Season 10!", "reviewBody": "This movie wasn't as good as the original movie (mainly because it felt like an hour and a half long episode), but I have to admit that the comedy in this movie was 110% top notch and better than all of the episodes that came after the original movie. When I heard that Stephen Hillenburg returned for the movie, I was excited. However, I can definitely tell that his sense of humor has changed (not in a bad way, though)\n\nFor example, Seasons 1-3 (Golden Era of SpongeBob) had some adult humor, mixed in with cartoonish humor for the more kid-friendly side. The original movie was also as such.\n\nSeason 4-9 were just straight bland cartoons. Nothing really funny, just Spongebob and Patrick laughing annoyingly for a 30 minute time slot, with the plot being something either rehashed, or just straight bland or predictable. \n\nThis movie, however, was WAY different than anything SpongeBob related I've ever seen. The comedy that Stephen Hillenburg brought back to the table was very different than we've seen in Seasons 1-3. The jokes in this movie made me think I was watching a movie like Airplane or Top Gun, the jokes just being unpredictable in the stupidest way, which was extremely funny. For example, there's a part where Plankton tells SpongeBob \"Wait! Hold your thoughts!\" and SpongeBob is then seen, literally holding a thought bubble, just stupid unpredictable comedy like that. I appreciate that, and love that it is refreshing. There were also some suggestive themes in the movie, so the adult appeal is definitely back!\n\nOn the kid side, it was also EXTREMELY different than I've ever seen in SpongeBob. At first, I didn't like how over the top and WEIRD this film was on the kid friendlier side, but I stopped and realized that kids from 1999 and kids from 2015 are ENTIRELY different and have different appeals. After realizing this, all of the randomness and overall WEIRDNESS in this movie made sense. Instead of following the same boring and bland formula from seasons 4-9, someone in the writing staff must have finally said \"Listen, we need to catch the appeal of kids today. If we're going to make kids interested in our show, we need to pull them in.\" and I have to say that it definitely did. I know what the kids are into these days (not trying to sound old), and SpongeBob definitely pulled it off in this new movie.\n\nWith an entirely different, hilarious, and refreshing comedy stance than seasons 1-3, and a huge attempt at actually appealing to kids of 2015 rather than following a bland formula, I have to say that Season 10 is going to be one of the best seasons since the show started. It will reel in kids again, as well as appealing to adults with classic humor and unpredictable comedy. I feel as if the entire show is going to be COMPLETELY different, and it will definitely be noticeable! \n\nIn a nutshell: Loved the movie, comedy was refreshing and hilarious, the kid friendlier side I thought was stupid, but you have to realize that kids in 2015 are different than kids from 1999.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}},

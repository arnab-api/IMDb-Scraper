This show looked like trash. A small and skinny woman with no muscles and no hips is supposed to be a badass fighter and so sexy. Of course she is black too. Diversity! Yeah. The bossy woman (sorry, the actress wasn't convincing AT ALL at the beginning) has two sidekicks, two good looking man. The first one is the typical nice guy, bff material, the other one is a very manly man, a soldier with a war trauma. Of course there is some sexual tension going on between him and the female lead. To make it short: I wasn't impressed. Slow motion scenes and those cringy one liners while fighting ('I like to dance') weren't helping either. I dropped it after episode two, and came back because I had nothing better to watch. Even though it was stupid, I didn't hate it. Well, so why the high rating? This show surprised me from the very beginning with the great world building. It reminds me a lot of Firefly and Cowboy Bebop. It was so excellent and creative in this area, that I was wondering how they decided to go with such cliche characters. The thing is: those characters aren't cliche. They did an incredible job with developing them over time. The chemistry between all of them is great (it reminds me of Supernatural in that matter), the story itself is one of the most suspenseful I have seen in a while. At the end of the day it's sci-fi fantasy and there may be some plotholes, but overall this is the kind of storytelling that I thought wouldn't exist anymore. It is really, really smart. Everything comes together so well, everything is exciting and suspenseful. The show is not too sexual (like many nowadays), but has some mature dialogues I really enjoy. This review doesn't do the show justice, which is a shame.

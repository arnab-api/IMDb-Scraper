Their works are slow paced but gather steam only as you reach the thought-provoking and stunning ends in each film. The one film that eluded me thus far of the 4 films is \"Sin\" (2019), a biopic on sculptor/painter Michelangelo, a copy of which was presented to the Pope by Putin. And the Pope is apparently an admirer of the director. One damning aside in the script is that Nobel Prize winner Mikhail Sholokov's \"And Quiet Flows the Don\" did not present the full truth of the events in the novel as one would have assumed it did. The award winning \"Paradise\" and \"The Postman's White Nights\" are the other wonderful works from the team.

I didn't even know this woman. I saw her for the first time last year in a ceremony where she received an achievement prize. But it is when I saw the 50th Anniversary Special hosted by Stephen Colbert last autumn that I started to really get interested because they showed sketches of the show. You Americans must stop hiding those talents from us! So I gathered so many shows I could find and I have to say that they are a delight to watch! There are some pretty awesome burlesque sketches in it and a lot of humanity too. And if you love the 70's, oh boy, you travel right back to that blessed period of time. And I have to mention the wonderful costumes made by a certain Bob Mackie. This guy is simply a genius! Some costumes look like Gaultier or Lacroix 20 years before! I love Carol Burnett and I am very happy to now know this great performer!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Carol Burnett Show: The Best Of Tim Conway", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4166170137", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU4OGFmYTYtYTY1MC00ZjM5LTkzYWItOGRkYjJhZDVhN2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU4OGFmYTYtYTY1MC00ZjM5LTkzYWItOGRkYjJhZDVhN2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Best Of Tim Conway", "uploadDate": "2017-03-11T08:57:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000993/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carol Burnett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061240/characters/nm0000993?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Various Characters"}, {"url": "#", "name": "279 episodes, 1967-1978"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10194312/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "The Ernie Flatt Dancers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061240/characters/nm10194312?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dancers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 1967-1978"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0905741/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lyle Waggoner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061240/characters/nm0905741?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Announcer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "185 episodes, 1967-1978"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0493069/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Vicki Lawrence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061240/characters/nm0493069?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Various Characters"}, {"url": "#", "name": "279 episodes, 1967-1978"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0466327/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Harvey Korman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061240/characters/nm0466327?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Various Characters"}, {"url": "#", "name": "256 episodes, 1967-1978"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176792/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tim Conway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0061240/characters/nm0176792?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Various Characters"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 1967-1978"}]}]}

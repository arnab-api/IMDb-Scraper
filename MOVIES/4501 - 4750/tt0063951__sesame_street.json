The show is now blocked into these segments in order.\n\nGreeting of the day:  Big Bird and the Sesame Street neighbors' great the viewers and either tell jokes play a game and/or sing a song.\n\nMonster Time:  In this segment either shorts with the classic Sesame Street monsters are shown (Grover, Elmo, Rosita etc.) or a new feature called \"Monster Clubhouse\" in which four new monsters give preschoolers a crash course in what goes on in a typical preschool day.\n\nNumber of the Day:  The Count hosts this segment (who else could do it better on Sesame Street) in which he uses a special counting organ to find what the number of the day is.  The segment is followed up with live-action and animated sketches which help the viewers give a better understanding of the numbers.\n\nStreet Story:  The story of the day is now done in one complete segment rather than scatted throughout the whole show as it was done in the past. It seems that preschoolers don't like things interrupted but other things and messages (commercials or not).  The stories teach everything from cooperation, friendship, feelings, problem solving etc.\n\nJourney to Ernie:  Big Bird and the viewers play a virural reality game in trying to find Ernie who hides in a box that resembles his red, yellow, and blue striped shirt with his rubber duckie in front of it.  The catch is it may not be the first or second boxes that contain Ernie.  The game begins a park and when BB is transported to other virtual environments and perform certain skills in order to find the box (memory recall, singing a song, doing a certain skill etc.).  If a box is found and does not have Ernie inside then a clip or segment is featured ranging from a special song or a kid that does something special, after which the game continues.  When Ernie is finally found then a sketch and/or song with Ernie is featured (sometimes with partner Bert).\n\nHero Guy: If Monster Clubhouse was not done in the Monstertime segment, then we see a sketch with Baby Bear and his imagery creation Hero Guy, in which they both learn about art, imagination, and problem solving.  Don't expect this to turn into a 'Big Bird's imaginary friend' running gag.  For those who complain about outing Snuffy this segement gives a fantasy friend to Baby Bear, and he is not going to try to prove that Hero Guy is real.\n\nLetter of the Day:  Cookie Monster is given the honor of hosting this segment by showing cookies that have a letter on them.  The problem is Cookie eventually gives in to his instincts and eats the cookie.  The clips after Cookie Monster's attempt to teach letters will help viewers learn the sounds and recognition of the letters themselves.\n\nSpanish Word of the Day:  Rosita along with Grover, Big Bird, and others on the street teach a Spanish word in a way that can be understood.\n\nElmo's World:  This guy should get his very own show and I am not joking. In the meantime Elmo encourages to learn about all kinds of things like Mail, Music, computers etc.  Elmo focuses on one subject to help kids understand what Elmo is inquisitive about on the day's segment.\n\nSome complain that Sesame Street is not what it used to be, but keep in mind its own show anymore.  It's now for OUR kids, and Sesame Street is forever programming to 2 to 5 year olds.  With some many shows for preschooler out their Sesame Street is one of the few survivors today and don't be surprised if it's still on for another 33 years teaching the basics of numbers, letters etc."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Tonight at 7 p.m.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4107777561", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzNDI2Mzg1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ3NDc2MDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzNDI2Mzg1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ3NDc2MDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Sesame Street Holiday Special from HBO.", "uploadDate": "2016-11-23T04:50:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818973/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Caroll Spinney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0063951/characters/nm0818973?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Big Bird"}, {"url": "#", "name": "628 episodes, 1969-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0625456/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jerry Nelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0063951/characters/nm0625456?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Herry Monster"}, {"url": "#", "name": "550 episodes, 1970-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001345/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jim Henson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0063951/characters/nm0001345?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ernie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "527 episodes, 1969-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0732896/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Martin P.

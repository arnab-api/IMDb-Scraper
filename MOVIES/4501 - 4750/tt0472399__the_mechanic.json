In this movie I think he is very good as the silent, deadly killer for hire. It is a straightforward killer/action/thriller. The story is nothing new but it is a well working story which is nicely executed.\n\nThe story is, as I wrote above, not very original. Killer for hire finds out that his next target is his mentor and friend. As the professional he is he executes the job anyway but later discoverers that not all is as is should be. Time for revenge. A simple, straightforward and well working story.\n\nThings are complicated a bit by Bishop taking his friend's son under his wings. Of course he wants to walk in his fathers footsteps. He is inexperienced but also undisciplined. Something that, not surprisingly, is causing problems.\n\nI do like that Bishop stays a no bullshit hardass killer throughout the entire movie. No whining or silly emotional outbreaks or breakdowns. I also like the unemotional, silent and deadly impression of a professional assassin the he radiates.\n\nThere are quite a few fairly well done action scenes in the movie ranging from silent assassinations to the obligatory blow things up scenes. The parts where Bishop and Steves goes after the big bad guy is quite well done with some quite cool stunts without being over the top.\n\nThe ending was probably the only thing in the movie that was a bit unexpected. Unexpected in a good way that is. I quite liked the little surprise there.\n\nOverall I as well as my son liked this movie quite a lot. I hope that Mechanic: Resurrection is as good as this one.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Mechanic", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2673842457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNDI1MjQ2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIzNjAxNA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwNDI1MjQ2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIzNjAxNA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An elite assassin (Statham) takes on an apprentice (Foster) who has a connection to one of his earlier targets.", "uploadDate": "2010-11-18T12:13:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005458/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jason Statham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm0005458?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Arthur Bishop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001282/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tony Goldwyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm0001282?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0153779/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jeff Chase"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm0153779?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Burke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0517576/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "James Logan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm0517576?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jorge Lara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4260228/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Joshua Bridgewater"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm4260228?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Car Jacker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132300/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Christa Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm0132300?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kelly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0638359/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mark Nutter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm0638359?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mr. Finch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1305056/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Lara Grice"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm1305056?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Finch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004936/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ben Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm0004936?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Steve McKenna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000661/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Donald Sutherland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm0000661?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Harry McKenna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1068565/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mini Anden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472399/characters/nm1068565?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272961/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eddie J.

When he was not on the screen, it did not flow like when he was on, and he was always on. He played stupid so brilliantly that he will have you busting a gut uncontrollably. The more dimwitted the funner it got.\n\nProving the It's so funny it's true statement is correct, Galifianakis leads an ensemble cast in a story based on true events about a security guard leading a boring life about to marry the only woman who would have him (Played hilariously by Kate Mckinnon) until his co-worker (Kristen Wiig) used her lady charm to convince him to help her friend (Played Owen Wilson, but not in his best role) rob their employer. Now he's on the run from The FBI (Played by the Hilarious, Leslie Jones), and a hit man hired to keep him from talking (Played by also Hilarious Jason Sudekis).\n\nIt's a pretty well laid out heist movie, but I got to say, it has so many comic masterminds in it you'd expect that I would laugh so hard, I die of it, but the only real worthy laughs come from Zach Galifinakis, who took the simplistic and turned it into comic gold. It's good enough just to see him do that.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi912963353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjE1OTM1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwMTE2OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjE1OTM1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwMTE2OTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A night guard at an armored car company in the Southern U.S. organizes one of the biggest bank heists in American history.", "uploadDate": "2016-08-02T13:09:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0302108/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Zach Galifianakis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0302108?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Ghantt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005562/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Owen Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0005562?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Steve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0837177/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jason Sudeikis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0837177?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mike McKinney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1634944/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Elizabeth Ellis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm1634944?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michelle Chambers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428656/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Leslie Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0428656?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Scanlon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0547800/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ken Marino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0547800?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Doug Jeffcoat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3197155/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tom Werme"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm3197155?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Anchorman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0190419/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nils Cruz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0190419?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Carlo's Uncle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1325419/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kristen Wiig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm1325419?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kelly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5155666/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ross Kimball"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm5155666?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Eric Payne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0711864/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Devin Ratray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0711864?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Runny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0571952/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kate McKinnon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0571952?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jandice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1789985/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jon Daly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm1789985?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Plewe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0669254/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Daniel Zacapa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm0669254?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Raydel Quintero"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1157209/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Njema Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2461150/characters/nm1157209?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ty Robertson"}]}]}

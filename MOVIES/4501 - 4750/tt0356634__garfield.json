The movie however fails to making a lasting impression. Nothing in the movie is something new or memorable. The story itself is also extremely simple. The fact that the movie is so incredible short makes the story seem even worse than it perhaps is.\n\nI'll admit that Garfield is a better looking CGI-character than Scooby-Doo was. Still that doesn't mean that Garfield looks incredibly impressive or realistic. Plus of course this movie has very little to do with the original cartoon, so many grew up with. None of the characters really make an impressive appearance, not even Bill Murray's voice talent can change this. Jennifer Love Hewitt is looking good in this movie but she gets very little to do and her characters just felt needless for this movie. A big disappointing character was the villain Happy Chapman he was not fun, not villainous enough and his exact motivations were too unclear and/or too lame.\n\nThe movie also fails to be really funny. The movie will perhaps make you grin at times but it almost most certainly won't make you laugh out loud. Still as simple clean entertainment it serves it purpose and I can't not entirely trash this movie. It does has its few moments but it simply all doesn't make a very lasting impression.\n\nEntertaining enough to watch it once.\n\n5/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Garfield The Movie", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2326331673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5OTZlMTktZDlhMS00YzVhLTk1N2MtZGM5NTYyYzk1Y2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5OTZlMTktZDlhMS00YzVhLTk1N2MtZGM5NTYyYzk1Y2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:15:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005227/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Breckin Meyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0005227?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0864997/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stephen Tobolowsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0864997?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Happy Chapman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0036439/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Evan Arnold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0036439?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wendell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1024074/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Vanessa Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm1024074?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Miss Ace Hardware"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0317547/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rufus Gifford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0317547?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dog Owner #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1596273/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ryan McKasson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm1596273?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dog Owner #3"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0107573/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Eve Brent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0107573?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mrs. Baker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0598282/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Monks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0598282?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Deputy Hopkins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001349/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jennifer Love Hewitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0001349?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Liz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000195/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bill Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0000195?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Garfield"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0492924/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mark Christopher Lawrence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0356634/characters/nm0492924?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Christopher Mello"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0469411/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Daamen J.

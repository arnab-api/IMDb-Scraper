Following the trials and tribulations of a deserter of the Mexican War who disappears in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado to become a mountain man, JEREMIAH JOHNSON eschews the conventions of the western as a genre in such a way as was only made possible for American cinema in the tumultuous era of early 70's with such visceral movies of frontier survival as MAN IN THE WILDERNESS and A MAN CALLED HORSE paving the way. \n\nAs Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford) wanders the mountains like a fugitive stricken by disaster, a solitary figure against awe-inspiring backdrops of massive rock formations, steep ravines and expansive mesas, you can tangibly feel the film, like the hero, transcending the specific time and place and breaching out vision to become an all-encompassing spiritual journey where the individual characters - fur trappers, bear hunters or Indians - are merely the unwitting parners in a dance of death.\n\nSome viewers may be put off by the lack of straight-forward plot, the episodic, repetitive nature of the movie or the long stretches of silence, but it's from those exact things the movie takes its power. JJ comes unto its own in those small moments of quietude, in Johnson's silent encounters with indians, in the barren, unforgiving wastes of the craggy mountains that reflect so well the psychology of characters wandering in their shadow, in the subtle, heartwarming interactions Johnson has with the Indian woman he's taken for a wife and the mute boy he's taken for a son. There's hardly a word uttered between this peculiar family the entire movie but the ways they learn to overcome the barriers that separate them is a touching sight to behold.\n\nThere is some dated montage, a corny soundtrack; how much of this will affect your enjoyment will boil down to your affinity with how cinema was in the 70's. Still, what is left is this beautiful parable of broken humans learning to be whole again. Equal parts visceral, savage and heartwarming."}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2088549913", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ5MTMzMDgtNGUyNC00YjdhLTgyNGQtZTMwZGRmZWI2ZWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ5MTMzMDgtNGUyNC00YjdhLTgyNGQtZTMwZGRmZWI2ZWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A mountain man who wishes to live the life of a hermit becomes the unwilling object of a long vendetta by the Crow tribe and proves to be a match for their warriors in single combat on the early frontier.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-27T13:31:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000602/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Redford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0000602?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeremiah Johnson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0093386/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Delle Bolton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0093386?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Swan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0555146/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Joaqu\u00edn Mart\u00ednez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0555146?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paints His Shirt Red"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0317369/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Stefan Gierasch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0317369?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Del Gue"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0070801/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paul Benedict"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0070801?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Reverend Lindquist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0173438/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jack Colvin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0173438?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lieutenant Mulvey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002095/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Will Geer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0002095?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bear Claw"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0016365/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Josh Albee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0016365?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Caleb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0572885/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Allyn Ann McLerie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0572885?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Crazy Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0029409/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Richard Angarola"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0029409?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Chief Two-Tongues Lebeaux"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0879006/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Charles Tyner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0879006?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Robidoux"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164273/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Matt Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0068762/characters/nm0164273?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Qualen"}]}]}

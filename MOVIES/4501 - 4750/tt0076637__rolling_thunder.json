My attraction to this film, outside of the interesting story, is the acting performance of William Devane, who plays the lead character. Seldom have I seen such a fascinating character.\n\nDevane's character, \"Major Charles Rane,\" had some interesting things to say BUT his silence was downright fascinating. Just the looks on his face and the absolute silence when his wife tells him she had been fooling around in his absence (when he had been suffering as POW, no less!) or when the robbers are giving him a horrible, sadistic beating. With the exception of one, maybe two outbursts, his language was surprisingly civil, too. \n\nThe movie had what I call \"that gritty '70s look\" to it but was well-filmed and probably would look very good on DVD. (We are still waiting for that to happen.) There were some solid closeup and shadow shots which added nicely to the neo-noir story. The violence is no-nonsense, straight-to-the-point and, with one exception at the end, realistically brutal........ but not overdone. The film starts slowly for the first 10-15 minutes but is a fast ride once the thieves enter the picture.\n\nCo-star Linda Haynes reminded me of Tuesday Weld but not quite as pretty and a tiny bit harder looking. Nonetheless, she was an interesting new face and one I still don't recall ever seeing in any other film. It's also fun to see such a young Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nRevenge movies can be a dime-a-dozen but this has at least one scene I guarantee you will never forget.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Rolling Thunder", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1215145497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM0YmE0ZTktM2EzZC00ODVkLWI0YTgtODBiZThmNzcyMjA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM0YmE0ZTktM2EzZC00ODVkLWI0YTgtODBiZThmNzcyMjA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Rolling Thunder", "uploadDate": "2013-06-06T04:25:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001137/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William Devane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0001137?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Major Charles Rane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0371495/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Linda Haynes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0371495?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Linda Forchet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001056/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dabney Coleman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0001056?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Maxwell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0039435/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Luke Askew"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0039435?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Automatic Slim"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0896116/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "James Victor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0896116?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lopez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0314412/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jordan Gerler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0314412?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mark"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0113832/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jerry Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0113832?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Patrolman 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0145014/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Anthony Castillo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0145014?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Street Urchin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000169/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tommy Lee Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0000169?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Johnny Vohden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0078940/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James Best"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0078940?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Texan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0250174/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lisa Blake Richards"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0250174?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Janet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0238033/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lawrason Driscoll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0238033?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cliff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0946720/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cassie Yates"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0946720?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Candy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007985/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jane Abbott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0007985?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sister"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0120702/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jacque Burandt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076637/characters/nm0120702?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bebe"}]}]}

While he was there, he found a photograph that a fallen marine carried with him for protection. The lady pictured was his beautiful wife, Beth (Taylor Shilling). Finding the likeness very appealing, Logan feels compelled to go to Louisiana, where the couple lived, and tell Beth what he knows of her husband's situation. But, when he arrives at the kennel Beth operates with help from her bright young son and her grandmother (Blythe Danner), the lovely lady thinks he is there to apply for a job and hands him an application. Stunned, Logan does so and when Beth learns he is a marine, she hires him on the spot. Naturally, she is still grieving the loss of her husband. Surprisingly, the deceased man is not the father of Beth's child. That awful man is still around, an ex-football star who got her pregnant during their senior year. Now divorced and a police officer, this man is unbearable, always creating problems and dreaming of the day that he will get Beth back. Everyone knows its not going to happen, except him. Proving he is a hard worker and good company, Beth wants to ignore Logan's vibes but finds she can't resist them. Will a romance ensue and will it last? What will the abusive ex-husband do if he finds out? This is a fair romantic drama, with an attractive and talented cast. The setting is also a major asset, for it is very scenic and beautiful. But, the story is just not strong enough to set it apart from countless other romantic dramas. This is surprising, for Sparks usually writes great material for films. Also, here is another tale of first husbands that truly are monster-like, which occurs in quite a few of Sparks works. So, it might seem too familiar as well. All in all, if you like the author or are searching for romantic movies that are fewer and fewer in number, you should give this one a try. While not outstanding, it has some passionate kisses that will please fans.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi5283353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMjMyNDEwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjgwMTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMjMyNDEwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjgwMTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A Marine travels to North Carolina after serving three tours in Iraq and searches for the unknown woman he believes was his good luck charm during the war.", "uploadDate": "2011-12-11T00:11:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1374980/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Zac Efron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1327194/characters/nm1374980?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Logan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001100/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Blythe Danner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1327194/characters/nm0001100?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ellie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272474/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jay R.

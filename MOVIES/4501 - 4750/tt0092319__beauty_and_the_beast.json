But this was a winner of a show in a style I've not seen since.  It was fantasy, true enough, but it addressed many contemporary issues with a skill seldom seen in TV.  The love story was believable, the acting was outstanding, and the minor characters were generally engaging.  This was a show for romantics, and for those who believe in the power of love--not just between lovers, but between family and friends, and those whose love spills over into actions.  Good fought evil in the grimy real world as well as in fantastic battles against shadowy adversaries.  And for those of us who like to pretend that the unknown really is just around the corner--this was our show.  Requiescat in pace."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Beauty & The Beast: Above Below & Beyond", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2550250777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFjZDg1ZDItNGM1MS00OWFmLWE0MGEtMmI0N2NkZTkxYjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWFjZDg1ZDItNGM1MS00OWFmLWE0MGEtMmI0N2NkZTkxYjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Beauty & The Beast: Above Below & Beyond", "uploadDate": "2019-04-12T01:26:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000579/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ron Perlman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092319/characters/nm0000579?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vincent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 1987-1990"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0010264/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jay Acovone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092319/characters/nm0010264?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Deputy D.A.

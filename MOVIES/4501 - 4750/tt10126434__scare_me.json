Somewhere there's a buried gem under all of this rubble in what I feel that could've been executed more nicely and interestingly. The plot is good, the acting is great, the ending is funny but the second act fails to keep the interesting factor across the whole experience.\n\nI really admire that the filmmakers force the audience to use their imagination for being entertained instead of drawing the scares for us like any typical horror...Quite challenging and daring try from the filmmakers but appreciated!\n\nThe directing is good, aids the story telling with limited yet nice effects, the introduction of the pizza guy was a good bore breaker but with the repetitive attitude it didn't succeed to elevate the middle of the movie from falling into the boredom trap. However, Scare Me is considered an intriguing shot and can be moderately enjoyed by many horror fan."}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4053909785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGNiN2Y1YmQtMzNkOC00NTQ4LWI3ZWYtZmVlZjFiNmM4OGZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGNiN2Y1YmQtMzNkOC00NTQ4LWI3ZWYtZmVlZjFiNmM4OGZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Fred (Josh Ruben), a frustrated copywriter, checks into a winter cabin to start his first novel.

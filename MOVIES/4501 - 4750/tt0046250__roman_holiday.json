Roman Holiday is a 1953 American romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003. On December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.\n\nThe DVD sat on my shelf for the longest time and I am so glad I took it out to watch. The screenplay is subtle, filled with nuances that Hepburn and Peck teased them out beautifully. I can hardly detect an air of pretension and emotional manipulation. This is as romantic as it gets between a princess and an everyday man. The ending in the big hall really hits the spot. So much is left unsaid but yet what is said speaks volumes. It never betrays the tone of what the film sets out to be but yet my heart was beating with the full desire of wanting to see the relationship go a certain more familiar way. This is an amazing date movie with oodles of intelligence.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Roman Holiday", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi930856473", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWYxMjJkOWYtODI0NC00MzIzLWIwMmQtOTdlM2VhMjcyZTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWYxMjJkOWYtODI0NC00MzIzLWIwMmQtOTdlM2VhMjcyZTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Leonard Maltin & Andrea Kalas", "uploadDate": "2020-07-25T17:08:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000060/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gregory Peck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0000060?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Joe Bradley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000734/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eddie Albert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0000734?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Irving Radovich"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930732/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Harcourt Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0930732?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ambassador"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0138479/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tullio Carminati"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0138479?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "General Provno"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0259599/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Claudio Ermelli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0259599?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Giovanni"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0729866/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Alfredo Rizzo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0729866?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Taxicab Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0330926/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gorella Gori"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0330926?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Shoe Seller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000030/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Audrey Hepburn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0000030?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Princess Ann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0694403/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hartley Power"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0694403?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mr. Hennessy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0712615/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Margaret Rawlings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0712615?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Countess Vereberg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0137567/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Paolo Carlini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0137567?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mario Delani"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0095979/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Paola Borboni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0095979?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Charwoman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0812726/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Laura Solari"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046250/characters/nm0812726?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hennessy's Secretary"}]}]}

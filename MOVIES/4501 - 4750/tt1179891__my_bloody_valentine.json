It is not a better than original slasher 80's but it is a decent solid remake that I enjoy. I like this film. I love the setting which takes place in the mine shaft and in the forest on a Valentine's Day. This movie has gore, nudity (in which original didn't had nudity) and it is a fun thrill ride.\n\nThis is a American remake of Canadian slasher film. From the cast too murder scenes these are impressive 3-D effects, the director Patrick Lussier knew what he was doing and everyone on the set did a fine job.\n\nA young man, who survived a vicious massacre, returns to his hometown only to become the prime suspect when someone wearing miner's gear begins pick-axing the locals left and right!\n\nThis is a good impressive slasher film that I love. I love the 3D murder effects. I love in the opening scene in which a guy get's a pickax in the eye I love thate ffect. I love in which a retired sheriff get's a pickax in his jaw and you see that effect in which that mask murder takes out pickax from his jaw and you see a blood flying in the camera that is a satisfying gore. You see a nude topless girl walking around the parking lot and her ex boyfriend gets pickaxed and so does she later in the motel. I love the gore in this movie. I love Prodigal Son Soundtrack from Michael Wandmacher for My Bloody Valentine song. I love the masked killer in a miner outfit with mask and pickax not a bad custom I love it.\n\nThe performances from the three leads Jensen Ackles, Jamie King, and Kerr Smith are solid, decent I love them they are likable characters. You have Tom Atkins from Halloween III and The Fog. You have Kevin Tighe from Another 48 Hrs. who did another solid job in this movie. Jensen Ackles brought me in to this film because I was huge fan of his TV show Supernatural back than.\n\nI love this film to death. Jansen Ackles I love the guy so much, I love his performance in this movie. Kerr Smith from Dawson's Creek and Final Destination was not bad as Sheriff Axel Palmer I enjoyed his performance I love him. Jaime King from Slackers as Sarah Mercer Palmer was a sexy babe, but smart she out smarted the killer I love her as the final girl. I love Betsy Rue as Irene she is not bad at all I love her been all nude in this movie. I don't prefer the remake over the original but it is an pair with the original for me.\n\nI love the good twist in the climax on the end, definitely my favorite slasher in remakes of all time.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "My Bloody Valentine 3-D: TV Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1610154777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MzIxNjc1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEzNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MzIxNjc1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEzNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the TV trailer for  Patrick Lussier's My Bloody Valentine 3-D, starring Jensen Ackles and Jaime King.", "uploadDate": "2008-12-23T13:05:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0010075/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jensen Ackles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0010075?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Hanniger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005445/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kerr Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0005445?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Axel Palmer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1346230/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Edi Gathegi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm1346230?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Deputy Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001798/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kevin Tighe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0001798?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ben Foley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2182505/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Karen Baum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm2182505?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Deputy Ferris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0531333/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Marc Macaulay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0531333?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Riggs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0387809/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeff Hochendoner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0387809?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Red"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3121643/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Liam Rhodes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm3121643?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0454809/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jaime King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0454809?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sarah Palmer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2175732/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Betsy Rue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm2175732?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Irene"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0040662/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tom Atkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0040662?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Burke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1443644/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Megan Boone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm1443644?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Megan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3193079/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joy de la Paz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm3193079?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rosa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267805/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Todd Farmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0267805?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Frank the Trucker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0641703/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bingo O'Malley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179891/characters/nm0641703?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Officer Hinch"}]}]}

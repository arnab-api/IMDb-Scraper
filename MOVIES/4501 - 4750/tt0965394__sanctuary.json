She's great as Magnus, not overdone, but sensitive, slightly badass and played right. She has a daughter, Ashley. She's instantly likable and Emelie Ullerup doesn't fall into the trap of making her the typical blond 'Yeah, uhuh I like totally, like, kick- ass. Isn't that cool!' character. Instead she's much better and thankfully without a teenage crisis. I'll get onto Robin Dunne's excellent Will in a sec.\n\nSanctuary is more than just the sum of its parts. It has a great grittiness to it, a real world, almost familiar environment. It's slightly dark, but optimistic at the same part. 30 minutes into the pilot and I really liked it. Will was believable, I even liked and sympathised with him. the way it was done felt like a feature, not really like an hour long weekly show. The whole actual Sanctuary concept wasn't done too fantastically. However I felt it wasn't perfect but it's taken me 2 more episodes to think that actually it's worth continuing to watch.\n\nFor Brits, its on ITV 4, mondays at 9. Or 8. Pretty sure it's 9, but check. if you don't have ITV 4, it's on their catch up thing on the site. For Americans it's on Hulu and Sci Fi's Rewind.\n\nHave fun getting into it, looking forward to see where it goes."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sanctuary: The Complete Fourth Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi510959897", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgyMWRkZDctZDdkNi00OWQ1LTg3NTMtNTY1NDk5MTAwMTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjgyMWRkZDctZDdkNi00OWQ1LTg3NTMtNTY1NDk5MTAwMTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Sanctuary: Season Four", "uploadDate": "2012-02-26T06:27:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0850102/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Amanda Tapping"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0965394/characters/nm0850102?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Helen Magnus"}, {"url": "#", "name": "59 episodes, 2008-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0382216/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christopher Heyerdahl"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0965394/characters/nm0382216?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bigfoot"}, {"url": "#", "name": "59 episodes, 2008-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1570191/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Agam Darshi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0965394/characters/nm1570191?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kate Freelander"}, {"url": "#", "name": "37 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242903/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robin Dunne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0965394/characters/nm0242903?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Will Zimmerman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "59 episodes, 2008-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0730455/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ryan Robbins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0965394/characters/nm0730455?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Henry Foss"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2008-2011"}]}]}

I was dead wrong.", "reviewBody": "This series, without a doubt, is a treasure of animation. Never once has a series or movie ever gotten me so interested. It isn't too long, it perfectly runs its course, unlike other fantastic shows like Adventure Time or Regular Show that can be hard to keep up with. Ten episodes, each about ten minutes, giving practically a feature- length movie that is certainly going to strike you as wonderful. Elijah Wood gives an amazing and realistic depiction of the average modern teen, and Greg provides the comical child-like wonder that we all could relate to our past as kids. Lessons in trust, family, friends, love, and honor perfectly blend with the simplistic yet entrancing artwork, and not since Gravity Falls has a cartoon ever amazed me with its genius concept and plot devices. The series is short and wonderful, and it needs more exploitation. And just as I was growing worried for animation on television like Clarence or Uncle Grandpa which leave little to be desired. If you like the creativity of Regular Show, the quirkiness of Adventure Time, and the art of Steven Universe, coupled with the humor of Amazing World of Gumball, this is without a doubt the best animated creation that has been put out in decades.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Over The Garden Wall", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3766598681", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGNmNjhiNDQtMzQ4Yi00Nzg3LThhMTUtNDBjZmExNDQ1MmY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGNmNjhiNDQtMzQ4Yi00Nzg3LThhMTUtNDBjZmExNDQ1MmY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Over The Garden Wall", "uploadDate": "2019-04-22T21:32:35Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000704/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elijah Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3718778/characters/nm0000704?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Wirt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001491/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Melanie Lynskey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3718778/characters/nm0001491?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Beatrice"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5242354/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Collin Dean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3718778/characters/nm5242354?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gregory"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2014"}]}]}

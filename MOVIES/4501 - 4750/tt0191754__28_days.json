The problem: the film itself tipsily overindulges its themes by balancing good drama with over-acting and imbalanced doses of comedy. \n\nIn a sense, the film knew it was dealing with touchy subject matter when it highlighted the realities of rehab in NY, but why did it need to purposefully throw in the stereotypical comedic archetypes - the viking accented Alan Tursdysk, or O'Malley's strapdown one liners, or for that matter, the debonair English accented intelligent metro lover in Dom West? Perhaps it was in 2000, and you needed to sell films that way to appeal to their target audience of teenagers who did weed and drank too much, but the fact is, when you have Steve Buscemi, Sandra Bullock and Viggo Mortensen in a film you can afford to push the drama-reality envelope and go in that direction. \n\nIn fact, the film's best moments are when Thomas does this- in a series of flashbacks to let the audience get in sync and depth with Bullock's character. And, there are scenes where the comedy can be done appropriately and in concordance with the film's thematic content- such as the skit at the end for Azura Skye's character. Sadly, these good moves are coupled with some really tipsy flaws, including the ending where Mortensen's character meets the soap star. Bullock's character also undergoes way too quick a character change (for 28 days) if one was to really nitpick.\n\nHowever, the themes in this film make this a film i would still recommend to youth and young people. Azura Skye's character's loneliness, depression and suicide are genuinely depicted, and the fragile and important message of hope and redemption amid the perfunctory nature of life in the rehab centre that are celebrated in the plot really help this film regain its footing. When Bullock's character realises that this (the pills and drugs) was not a way to live, and Mortensen addresses her insecurities of not being able to do a single thing right, the film touches significant depths and strikes the chords of viewers. My personal favourite was the scene were Lizzy Perkins' character acknowledges the flaws of hers and her sister's lives and establishes love and hope in reconciliation. You see, it is the film's ability to reach such levels that I know this film suffered from tipsily overindulging its themes-trying to tie in too much to everyone- from being a comedy to a drama.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "28 Days", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2301297433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUxMWI1ZTUtNTk1OC00YzZhLWFiMzctMTA2ZTgyYjJkNjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmUxMWI1ZTUtNTk1OC00YzZhLWFiMzctMTA2ZTgyYjJkNjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures", "uploadDate": "2009-02-20T06:03:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000113/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sandra Bullock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0000113?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gwen Cummings"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0922035/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dominic West"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0922035?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jasper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005439/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Azura Skye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0005439?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Andrea"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0876138/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alan Tudyk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0876138?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gerhardt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001399/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marianne Jean-Baptiste"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0001399?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Roshanda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002663/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Diane Ladd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0002663?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bobbie Jean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0470546/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Susan Krebs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0470546?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Evelyn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0770117/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Katie Scharf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0770117?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Young Gwen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001557/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Viggo Mortensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0001557?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eddie Boone"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001610/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elizabeth Perkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0001610?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000114/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Steve Buscemi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0000114?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cornell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005282/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mike O'Malley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0005282?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Oliver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0763858/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Reni Santoni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0763858?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Daniel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0553269/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Margo Martindale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0553269?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Betty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0906525/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Loudon Wainwright III"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0191754/characters/nm0906525?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Guitar Guy"}]}]}

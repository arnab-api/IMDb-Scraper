I still prefer the Disney version, thank you very much. At least in those films the story flows smoothly and the characters are not cardboard cutouts. That being said, this particular fairy tale movie was a pleasant surprise. For one, it didn't try to retell the same exact story we have grown up with. Rather it took the story of Hansel and Gretel and asked the question: \"What if they grew up?\" I'm totally on board with that question. It's something we've never seen before and frankly it's a fascinating idea. So yeah, colour me interested.\n\nThe film itself ends up being pretty much what anyone would expect. I hesitate to call it a good film, because it has numerous plot holes, nonsensical twists and its characters are somewhat bland and clich\u00e9d. On the other hand, it has a good visual style, its action is very pleasing, if a bit gore-filled (not a bad thing in this case), the two main actors are actually pretty good in their roles, and as a whole it's just plain solid fun. Yeah, it's stupid most of the time, but it's fun kind of stupid. The kind where you're just able to sit back, enjoy the scenery and laugh at the jokes.\n\nIt also needs to be remembered that this was Tommy Wirkola's first big budget film. And for a debut film, this shows a lot of promise. The style is definitely there, as is the atmosphere. The story-telling and the character development need some work, but even big name directors struggle with those every now and then. I'm looking forward to what this guy will bring us next.\n\nAnd that's this film. Yeah, it's one of those so bad it's good films, but I'd still recommend this. The idea alone is worth checking out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version -- #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1709876249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY0ODg5MzYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTYyNjM0OA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY0ODg5MzYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTYyNjM0OA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In this dark spin on the fairy tale, siblings Hansel and Gretel are a formidable team of bounty hunters who track and kill witches all over the world.", "uploadDate": "2012-09-06T08:22:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719637/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeremy Renner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0719637?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hansel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000463/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Famke Janssen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0000463?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Muriel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0575216/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Derek Mears"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0575216?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Edward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2070336/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm2070336?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Horned Witch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3287038/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Thomas Mann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm3287038?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0839209/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bj\u00f8rn Sundquist"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0839209?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jackson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0770144/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Thomas Scharff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0770144?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2704342/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cedric Eich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm2704342?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Young Hansel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2605345/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gemma Arterton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm2605345?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gretel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2273799/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pihla Viitala"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm2273799?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235960/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Robin Atkin Downes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0235960?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Edward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2251846/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joanna Kulig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm2251846?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Red Haired Witch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001780/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Peter Stormare"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0001780?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sheriff Berringer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0090674/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rainer Bock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0090674?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mayor Engleman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0989506/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kathrin K\u00fchnel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1428538/characters/nm0989506?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Adrianna"}]}]}

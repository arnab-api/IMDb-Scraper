Opinions are subjective as we all know, so make of this what you will.\n\n'Licence to Kill' is one of the top five best Bond movies of all time along with it's powerhouse theme song. Up until this particular picture, we were introduced to Sean Connery's unique suave, set against an array of exotic backdrops and a strong supporting cast. George Lazenby, although criticised for being boring, offered us some great action sequences in his short time as the British spy. A sophisticated edge that was overpowered by it's comical tone throughout his run, Roger Moore took the reins during the 70's and early 80's. Then in 1987, Welsh actor Timothy Dalton donned the role of 007.\n\nWith 'The Living Daylights' establishing Dalton as James Bond, we were given fair warning on the tonal shift. Given this was the 80's, where a number of films were heavily inclusive of hard 'R' violence - 'Licence to Kill' adapted and not only brought us a visceral Bond film, but as many film historians have cited, one of the, if not the closest portrayals of Ian's Flemming's character.\n\nFor those giving current Bond actor, Daniel Craig the credit (or hate in some cases) for a cold and stoic interpretation of the character, I suggest you watch the Timothy Dalton Bond films, because this is where it started.\n\nIn 'Licence to Kill', Bond is essentially a one many army taking on a South American cocaine czar. This is a James Bond that up until this point was never seen like this on screen before. His best friends are maimed, he's stripped of his rank, his government and as it relates to the title - his licence to kill is revoked. He is left with almost nothing aside from his skills and weapons expert, Q.\n\nDalton plays Bond as a wounded wolf with a sensitivity and vulnerability visible in his eyes and the way he emotes. As opposed to his predecessors, Dalton plays the character with an introspective approach, where you can feel the torment and tension bubbling inside. Even when he smiles, there is pain, reminding us of what he has endured as a human being.\n\nBond's antagonist is played by Robert Davi - another underrated performer known mostly for his roles as a villain. He plays a drug king with a code, where loyalty seems to matter more than the money. We are immediately set with these two huge characters on a road to collision; the dark angel's raid on the reaper that claimed the lives and elements that held Bond together.\n\nThe whole film is non-stop and that also reflects the carnage and violence. The climactic chase is one of the best with the inclusion of trucks, jeeps and a plane against a beautiful Mexican mountain view.\n\nAs a huge proponent for Timothy Dalton's Bond, I advise any fans of the series to watch or re- watch his incarnations. Hopefully an appreciation will come about for how truly great and underrated he was.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H13M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Licence to Kill", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2476317465", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmFmMWVlNmEtZTQ5Zi00ZTBmLWFlMTgtZWQwODg1NTI1OWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmFmMWVlNmEtZTQ5Zi00ZTBmLWFlMTgtZWQwODg1NTI1OWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 2 for Licence To Kill", "uploadDate": "2011-01-06T06:19:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001096/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Timothy Dalton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0001096?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Bond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001108/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Davi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0001108?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Franz Sanchez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001875/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anthony Zerbe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0001875?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Milton Krest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569239/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Everett McGill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0569239?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Killifer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001125/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Benicio Del Toro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0001125?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dario"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001917/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Pedro Armend\u00e1riz Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0001917?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "President Hector Lopez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0373314/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Hedison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0373314?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Felix Leiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0114533/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Robert Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0114533?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "M"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000508/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carey Lowell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0000508?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pam Bouvier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000650/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Talisa Soto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0000650?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lupe Lamora"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0574433/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Frank McRae"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0574433?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sharkey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0628611/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wayne Newton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0628611?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Professor Joe Butcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0823289/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Anthony Starke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0823289?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Truman-Lodge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005155/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Desmond Llewelyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0005155?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Q"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0055733/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Priscilla Barnes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097742/characters/nm0055733?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Della Churchill"}]}]}

Not very often is there a screen couple that have the same chemistry together that they do.\n\nNewman, however, steals the show.  If you watch \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" for nothing else, watch it for his performance.  One of the greatest actors of all time, Newman showcases how powerful an actor he can be.  This is not to say the supporting cast isn't excellent.  Burl Ives is superb in a supporting role as Big Daddy, a man who's greatest concern is having his legacy live on after him.  The sequence with Ives and Newman in the basement of the house remains one of the most incredible displays of acting I have ever seen.\n\n\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is a very appropriate title.  It is a searing, wonderfully acted film that I will not soon forget.  I recommend those who haven't seen it yet to rent it as soon as they get a chance.

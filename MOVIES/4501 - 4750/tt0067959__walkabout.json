Considering the fact that this movie was made in 1971, one must conclude that Roeg was a trend-setter. For my personal tastes, he went a little overboard with the freeze frames, jump cutting, radical though hardly subtle politics, and juxtaposition of jarring images. Aboriginal tearing into meat, Australian white butcher cutting meat in a sanitized setting, back to the Aboriginal, back to the butcher, and back again to the Aboriginal. And what's with all the scenes involving decomposing bodies? Yes, savage innocence, evil imperialists, death, nature vs. industrialization, corruption of a purer way of life, we see all these themes, but it would have been preferable to see it without being visually and aurally clubbed over the head like the poor animals in the outback are.\n\nDisregarding that aspect, I quite liked the story of two white children, one very young, the other pubescent (and lingeringly shot), who get stuck in the Outback after their patriarchal and borderline psycho father is blown up. They then struggle to make it in the wild, and come upon an Aboriginal boy who is on a \"walkabout\", or a rite of passage journey that boys that age traditionally undertake in order to prove their worthiness as a man. This of course, becomes their walkabout, and they too become \"wild\" and free. Eventually, they make it back to \"civilization\", the first sign of this being a beautiful shot of the girl (whose name we never know- thus making it even more symbolic), coming into a clearing and gliding her hand over a man-made fence while walking backwards. What could be more symbolic of the Western values of property and ownership than a fence? She is ecstatic to be near an environment she holds dear, but her younger and more adaptable brother is less so, and the Aboriginal boy is even less so, which leads to tragic consequences.\n\nThe movie feels dated, not only in terms of camera-work but also thematically. It's no longer the job of white people to romanticize \"savage\" peoples, but rather to allow peoples to define themselves. Perhaps Roeg, in some small way, recognized this, thus choosing to have the Aboriginal boy speak his language and not provide us with subtitles. We could never understand totally, though we can sympathize.\n\ncococravescinema.blogspot.com", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Walkabout", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3739287833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJiYmFlYWEtODRhNC00ZjBiLTg5ZmEtMGFiZDFhY2Q5Zjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJiYmFlYWEtODRhNC00ZjBiLTg5ZmEtMGFiZDFhY2Q5Zjc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Walkabout", "uploadDate": "2008-04-18T12:00:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000256/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jenny Agutter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0000256?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0347858/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "David Gulpilil"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0347858?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Black Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0567460/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robert McDarra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0567460?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0407813/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Illingsworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0407813?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Girl's Husband"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0232685/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Barry Donnelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0232685?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Australian Scientist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0541396/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carlo Manchini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0541396?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Italian Scientist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0736312/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Luc Roeg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0736312?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "White Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0576851/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John Meillon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0576851?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0142575/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Peter Carver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0142575?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "No Hoper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0051414/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hilary Bamberger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0051414?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Father's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0114356/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Noeline Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0067959/characters/nm0114356?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "German Scientist"}]}]}

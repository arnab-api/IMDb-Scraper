I came to IMDb to look up who the lead actress was. Upon finding the poor reviews on this movie i had to make an account. I have had enough of these movie \"critics\". Every time i come on here i see ratings that do not justify the movies. Time and time again all you read is some snob critic complaining about something and the sheep of mindless dummies nod and agree. Im not going to go into full details about this movie but rather give my two cents from a person who's life basically is stories on screens. My criteria for \"good\" movies/shows. 1.)is the lead actor good. 2.)Is it different. 3.)Was it entertaining 4.)Was it predictable 5.)How was the story telling. Do not listen to the mindless hordes of know it all, the lead actor was good, the story was not predictable and it was entertaining overall. watch this movie and judge for yourself.

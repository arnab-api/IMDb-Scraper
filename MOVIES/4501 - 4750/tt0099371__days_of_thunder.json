Cole Trickle, a name that became an icon, an inspiration and a hero for auto racing drivers way back in early 90's. An enthralling and roller coaster ride jammed with high octane racing action, enough to blast you off the seat. Days of Thunder gave birth to the sparkling chemistry between once upon a time two of the most memorable on-screen and off-screen couples Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.\n\nThe story revolves around a young and smashing, auto racing rookie, Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise), who, after trying in the American open wheel ranks, seeks to grab a win on the NASCAR circuit. Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall), his mentor is his crew's chief. He also develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), a brain surgeon who's not so easy to convince when it comes to love. Claire works on Cole after a severe race accident, while racing with his competitor, Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker). But then comes the arrogant and dangerous newcomer, Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes) with owner Tim Daland (Randy Quaid), challenges Cole for a comeback to the race track. Finally after being convinced by his friend Rowdy, Cole hits the race track to complete his unfinished business against Russ.\n\nTom Cruise's classy portrayal of a hot shot auto racing rookie oozing with galvanizing confidence and energy won the millions of heart for his adorable and mesmerizing display of power and aggression as Cole Trickle. Starting with his stunning intro coming out from the smoke with a bike to defeating his rival Russ Wheeler at the end, he ignites an emulsifying inspiration in this journey of powerhouse racing. Cruise and Kidman's electrifying chemistry scorches the screen with witty dialogues and sizzling romance. Robert Duvall plays an absolute superb cameo complementing Cruise to the top.\n\nTony Scott's and Cruise's record breaking deadly combination that gifted the 1986's blockbuster, Top Gun reunited to recreate the same magic in Days of Thunder, which can be said as a sequel to Top Gun. Hans Zimmer's remarkable and awesome background score ecstatically blends with the mood when it comes to the racing events and defining the characters. Days of Thunder gives two of the best all time classic tracks: \"The Last Note of Freedom\" by David Coverdale and \"Show Me Heaven\" by Maria McKee.\n\nIf you are desperately into racing then Days of Thunder is the perfect one to punch the required inspirational boost within. It has its own indefinable class, style and persona that can't be left unnoticed. A must watch for Cruise fans; witness him cruising the top like never before.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Days of Thunder", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3388980761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk3NjVmODctMmQ2Mi00ZTQ5LThkYWQtMjJjNDY0NmYzMzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk3NjVmODctMmQ2Mi00ZTQ5LThkYWQtMjJjNDY0NmYzMzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Newly Remastered Limited Edition", "uploadDate": "2020-04-21T17:01:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000129/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Cruise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099371/characters/nm0000129?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cole Trickle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000173/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nicole Kidman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099371/characters/nm0000173?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Claire Lewicki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000144/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cary Elwes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099371/characters/nm0000144?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Russ Wheeler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000669/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Fred Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0099371/characters/nm0000669?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Big John"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0703862/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "J.C.

Parasyte: The Maxim is a stunning new science fiction anime with a unique story and rock solid character development. The series examines themes of transformation and change - Ovid's literary masterpiece \"Metamorphoses\", after which the opening episode is named, immediately comes to mind for comparison. \n\nParasyte: The Maxim (2014) is based on a manga series that ran from 1988 to 1995. Most of us won't realize this fact now, but bizarre science fiction focusing on alien lifeforms was quite popular in the 1980s and 90s. Great science fiction films like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Thing (1982), The Fly (1986) and They Live (1988) are but a few examples of films that popularized the genre. Parasyte has successfully resurrected bizarre sci-fi for a new generation, and the timing couldn't have been better. \n\nThe protagonist of Parasyte is not your typical hero and the plot is far from clich\u00e9. As a caterpillar undergoes change by transforming into a butterfly, so the protagonist undergoes change by transforming into a new man; your job as the viewer is to ask questions about this transformation and find the meaning behind it - ergo, what exactly has transformed and why does it matter?\n\nThe plot is believable and not outside the realm of possibility considering our limited knowledge of the universe. Like Ovid's masterpiece, the anime expertly probes the meaning of humanity; what it means to be human and what makes us human; as well as the psychological and physiological state of sentient beings. Ultimately, the series focuses on the protagonist's intellectual development or more precisely his intellectual \"evolution\". The evolutionary concept of survival of the fittest comes into direct conflict with the protagonist's views on empathy and altruism which proves problematic for decision making and creates for him a moral dilemma: should he place himself in danger in order to help others? The human part of him says yes, while another sinister part of him says no. But perhaps I've said too much.\n\nThe first 5 episodes set the stage for an astonishing and action packed story that follows. The series will make your jaw drop. I've seen every episode thus far and I see nothing but a bright future for this series. If you haven't seen Parasyte, what are you waiting for? This is the best new anime of 2014. It will become immensely popular. If you watch it now you will be amongst the few who can say that you were a fan from the start. Parasyte rivals Attack on Titan and Steins; Gate. If you loved those shows, you will love Parasyte as well.\n\nA top notch science fiction anime with unlimited potential. DO NOT MISS! \n\n10/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Parasyte: The Maxim", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi264289561", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWY3OTA0NmMtNjM4Yy00MDJjLWIyODgtNjMzYzZlZTVlZjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWY3OTA0NmMtNjM4Yy00MDJjLWIyODgtNjMzYzZlZTVlZjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Parasyte: The Maxim", "uploadDate": "2019-04-06T01:29:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3654365/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Adam Gibbs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm3654365?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Shinichi Izumi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1931870/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brittney Karbowski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm1931870?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Migi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0160049/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Luci Christian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm0160049?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Satomi Murano"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3670298/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Terri Doty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm3670298?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Yuko Tachikawa"}, {"url": "#", "name": "17 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0351758/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hilary Haag"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm0351758?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Akiho Suzuki"}, {"url": "#", "name": "15 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1074164/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Masaki Aizawa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm1074164?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kazuyuki Izumi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0612818/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rob Mungle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm0612818?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kazuyuki Izumi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1435774/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aya Hirano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm1435774?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Migi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4858403/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nobunaga Shimazaki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm4858403?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shinichi Izumi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2573928/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kana Hanazawa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm2573928?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Satomi Murano"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4808444/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kiyono Yasuno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm4808444?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Yuko Tachikawa"}, {"url": "#", "name": "17 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6350297/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rena Maeda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm6350297?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Akiho Suzuki"}, {"url": "#", "name": "15 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2616820/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joanne Bonasso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm2616820?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Reiko Tamura"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848968/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Atsuko Tanaka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3358020/characters/nm0848968?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Reiko Tamura"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}]}

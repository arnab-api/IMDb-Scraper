The characters were such, that you didn't care if they got eaten or not, and apart from the quite brilliant scene used in the trailer (you can see why) it didn't really deliver many scares.\n\nI won't say it was atrocious, because it wasn't, it is more what I'd class as a fun movie.\n\nHow long before a dive into the waters of The Arctic, and divers get terrified by Greenland sharks?

When Wendy, a teenage girl living in late 19th century Britain, decides she doesn't want to grow up, Peter escorts her and her two younger brothers to Neverland, where an evil pirate named Captain Hook is out to get revenge on Peter Pan.\n\nMany older Disney films are considered classics, and Peter Pan is definitely one of them. From the characters, to the top notch animation, Peter Pan is one of the most iconic animated films of all time. Even 60 years later, most everyone has seen Peter Pan, from people who grew up with it when it came out, to children who are growing up with it today. Rewatching Peter Pan, however, I found a few problems with it that stand out along with all of the great aspects of the film.\n\nTo start, the animation in Peter Pan is absolutely timeless. Every hand drawn fame of the characters or environment looks amazing, and engulfs the viewer into the bright, whimsical place that is Neverland. All of the characters are also excellently animated, especially when in action. The two characters that stand out the most are that of Peter Pan and his rival, Captain Hook. This particular aspect demands that, in each scene, the viewers' eye is drawn to either of the two enemies, which was a very smart move on the filmmakers' part.\n\nOn the subject of characters, all of the voice acting is very good, with great performances being given by, specifically, that of Bobby Driscoll (as Peter) and Hans Conried (as both Hook and Mr. Darling). These two play off of each other brilliantly, washing away all suspicion of two men recording in a studio. The other actors also do very well, and aren't necessarily outshadowed by that of Driscoll or Conried.\n\nOne big issue I did find with Peter Pan was the pacing. It may be confusing to read, but the pacing in Peter Pan is so good that it makes a 77 minute film feel like 45 minutes. Each and every scene is so necessary that the film flies by very quickly. One blink could cause major confusion with how a character got from point A to point B, or where the characters even are. It may be hard to comprehend, but, once seeing the film, this problem is understandable.\n\nAnother issue I found with the film is the writing for Peter Pan himself. Peter Pan, as written in the original play, is a fun loving child that never grows up. He is supposed to be free- spirited, and a caring person. However, the script for this film seems to portray Peter as a cocky, selfish jerk. He feels as if he's above the Darling children, and, at points in the film, is pretty close to being hated by the audience. He begins to get a bit annoying, and has the viewer rooting for Wendy and her brothers, therefore indirectly rooting for Peter, rather than having us root for Peter himself.\n\nOverall, Peter Pan isn't as fantastic as I had remembered it to be. Is it a good, timeless film? Yes, it is, but it has a few more problems that I see more clearly now than I used to. Anyone who isn't too hard on films will enjoy Peter Pan, and others will, too, because it is a pretty good movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H17M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Peter Pan: Signature Collection", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3276584985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjAzMjZmMTEtOTNiZC00ODY2LWFiNjktZGQ5NzBhZmI2YWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjAzMjZmMTEtOTNiZC00ODY2LWFiNjktZGQ5NzBhZmI2YWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Clock to Neverland Trailer", "uploadDate": "2018-05-09T17:12:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0237985/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bobby Driscoll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0237985?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Pan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0175788/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hans Conried"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0175788?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Captain Hook"}, {"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0175788?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mr. Darling"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0029456/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Heather Angel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0029456?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Darling"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0527220/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tommy Luske"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0527220?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Darling"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007218/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tom Conway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0007218?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Narrator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0054036/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Don Barclay"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0064607/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kathryn Beaumont"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0064607?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wendy Darling"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0859892/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bill Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0859892?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mr. Smee"}, {"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0859892?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pirates"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0172598/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paul Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0172598?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Darling"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0133752/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Candy Candido"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0046183/characters/nm0133752?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Indian Chief"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0243425/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Roland Dupree"}, "character_and_episodes": []}]}

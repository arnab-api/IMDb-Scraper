But after seeing a few more commercials and looking into it some more, I decided to give this film the benefit of the doubt and I am NOT disappointed.\n\nThe film stands on its own feet much better than the first film did, and mostly because of what it's going for. Instead of trying to be a Horror movie, it becomes a fantastic Thriller/Action film set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future about a group of people trying to survive on a night where it's all-out war on the streets.\n\nA lot of themes are explored -- Human Nature, Fear, Anger, Revenge, Heroism -- in ways that many other movies don't really explore it. And more than that, every small detail is kept in mind throughout the film.\n\nCompared to everything else I've seen so far this year, this is by far the best thriller film to come out. It holds its own and it has a message instead of just being a movie about wanton violence. The action scenes are done well, and the tension is enough to keep interest even in the low parts of the film. Every moment you think is safe leads directly into the next moment of pressure for the main characters, and you can't help but sympathize for the characters who (all but one) don't even want to be stuck out here on this horrid night.\n\nI very highly recommend this film to anyone who likes thrillers or action films with a little bit of psychological horror thrown in.\n\nAnd a little bit of a tip? Forget everything from the first film. \"The Purge\" doesn't set up or explain anything that this film doesn't, doesn't add anything to this film, and isn't even worth watching beforehand.\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy is a great film in its own right and it's worth watching. My only issue is that the first film couldn't have been more like this.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4137462809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODk0NzA1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzYxNzcwMjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODk0NzA1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzYxNzcwMjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A young couple works to survive on the streets after their car breaks down right as the annual purge commences.", "uploadDate": "2014-06-25T18:30:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342029/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frank Grillo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0342029?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sergeant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1472917/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zach Gilford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm1472917?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Shane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2954703/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Zo\u00eb Soul"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm2954703?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cali"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0064040/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Beasley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0064040?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Papa Rico"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0346595/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Noel Gugliemi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0346595?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Diego"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931324/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Michael Kenneth Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0931324?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carmelo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3147751/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "LaKeith Stanfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm3147751?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young Ghoul Face"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1294002/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Niko Nicotera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm1294002?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Roddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0252238/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Carmen Ejogo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0252238?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eva Sanchez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0760989/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kiele Sanchez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0760989?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Liz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532461/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Justina Machado"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0532461?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tanya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0174780/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jack Conley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0174780?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Big Daddy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0346003/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Castulo Guerra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0346003?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Barney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388064/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Edwin Hodge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0388064?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bloody Stranger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0883595/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Roberta Valderrama"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2975578/characters/nm0883595?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lorraine"}]}]}

The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.\n\nSidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...\n\nThe film's opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.\n\nThis is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.\n\nScream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Scream 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi919641625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWUwYzkxMjMtNjlmMy00M2Q3LTgwYWYtMWVhNTRiZjk2YWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWUwYzkxMjMtNjlmMy00M2Q3LTgwYWYtMWVhNTRiZjk2YWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:44:35Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000586/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jada Pinkett Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0000586?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maureen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0666349/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paulette Patterson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0666349?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Usher Giving Out Costumes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001287/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Heather Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0001287?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "'Stab' Casey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005687/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Peter Deming"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0005687?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Popcorn Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0568777/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rebecca McFarland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0568777?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Theater Girl #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005264/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Elise Neal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0005264?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hallie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932078/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kevin Williamson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0932078?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cotton's Interviewer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0163834/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dave Allen Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0163834?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Reporter Outside Theater"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004898/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Omar Epps"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0004898?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Phil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0775524/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rasila Schroeder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0775524?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Screaming Girl Up Aisle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413996/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Roger Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0413996?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "The Voice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0343459/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Molly Gross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0343459?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Theater Girl #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000117/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Neve Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0000117?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sidney Prescott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000630/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Liev Schreiber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0000630?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cotton Weary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0373164/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sandy Heddings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120082/characters/nm0373164?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Girl in Dorm Hallway"}]}]}

So, I decided to catch it on TV.\n\nTo my surprise, I was not disappointed. Not all of it is laugh out loud funny but it does make you smirk and at times you do indeed laugh out loud. The opening sequence was hilarious.\n\n\"Key and Peele\" do grow on you. That being said, there is still a lot of work needed. For example, cutting out the whole stand-up bit they do in front of a live audience in between sketches.\n\nThe show should be purely a sketch show. Much like Portlandia. It is the same concept for Portlandia except for that it is the \"black version\".\n\nThe show is funny to all demographics especially black and white Americans which I believe was the main aim.\n\nI will definitely be watching the next episode.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Key & Peele", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3583687961", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDEzMWRjYzEtNTZlZC00ZmE1LWJmYjktMDVhNzBmMjZkMzYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDEzMWRjYzEtNTZlZC00ZmE1LWJmYjktMDVhNzBmMjZkMzYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Key & Peele", "uploadDate": "2019-03-17T14:10:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1221047/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Keegan-Michael Key"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1981558/characters/nm1221047?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Various Characters"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1443502/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jordan Peele"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1981558/characters/nm1443502?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Various Characters"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}]}

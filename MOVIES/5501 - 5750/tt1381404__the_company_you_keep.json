We revolt simply because, for many reasons, we can no longer breathe.\" Frantz Fanon \n\nIn Robert Redford's The Company You keep, Jim Grant (Redford) is an attorney on the lam for participating in Weather Underground anti-Vietnam activities over 40 years ago. That a bank robbery resulted in the death of a guard has made the revolutionaries fugitives from murder charges.\n\nThis political thriller, in which the FBI has finally zeroed in on the robbers because Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon) has decided to turn herself in, devolves into a formulaic chase with helicopters and frantic cell calls, but along the way has some engaging dialogue (\"Yeah we all died. Some of us just came back.\" Donal Fitzgerald, played by Nick Nolte) often given in the repartee style of screwball comedy without the comedy.\n\nI am most surprised at director Redford's political restraint, given his inclination to preach baldly in previous films and in his personal life. The Company You Keep smoothly combines the pacing of a race for survival with the consciousness of a moderate liberal trying to show the unglamorous effects of sins, like excessive ambition and murder, over a lifetime. In its favor the film does not overdo its sympathy for the kids of these radicals, although Brit Marling as Rebecca Osborne would make anyone cry over her, so innocent-looking she is.\n\nWhile the film tends to emphasize the personal effects on lovers and families to the exclusion of the Weatherman history, it still is instructive about the radical movements decades ago. Although the theme of the ramifications of keeping a secret are parsed by Grant in a too-contrived monologue, the point is well taken, for each secret revealed adds another layer of punishment for all, even children.\n\nIf Redford weren't so wrapped up in nostalgia and stuck to the hard-core reasons for some very bright people's stupidity, this could have been a soaring achievement of documenting history in dramatic form. As it is, it's a smart thriller that has some lessons, both political and personal, for all the audience."}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2187699993", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMTM3NjM3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIwMjExOQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMTM3NjM3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTIwMjExOQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A thriller centered on a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run from a journalist who has discovered his identity.", "uploadDate": "2013-02-15T14:32:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000602/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Redford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0000602?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Grant"}, {"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0000602?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nick Sloan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001046/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julie Christie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0001046?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mimi Lurie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000560/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nick Nolte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0000560?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Donal Fitzgerald"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005024/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Terrence Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0005024?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "FBI Agent Cornelius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420955/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Richard Jenkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0420955?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jed Lewis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0322407/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brendan Gleeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0322407?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Henry Osborne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000385/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sam Elliott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0000385?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mac Mcleod"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3450022/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jackie Evancho"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm3450022?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Isabel Grant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0479471/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Shia LaBeouf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0479471?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ben Shepard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000215/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Susan Sarandon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0000215?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sharon Solarz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177933/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chris Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0177933?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Daniel Sloan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001804/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Stanley Tucci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0001804?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ray Fuller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447695/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Anna Kendrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0447695?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Diana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1779870/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brit Marling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm1779870?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rebecca Osborne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0740535/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Stephen Root"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1381404/characters/nm0740535?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Billy Cusimano"}]}]}

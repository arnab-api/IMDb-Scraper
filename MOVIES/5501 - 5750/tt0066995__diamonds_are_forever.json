Connery's return to his role for a final throw is simply disappointing... Seeking a diamond smuggler, Bond has adventures in Amsterdam, in a Los Angeles crematorium, in various Las Vegas gambling parlors, and in a secret factory in Nevada desert...\n\nFor that Bond receives an urn containing a hoard of gems; leads the police on a wild chase; drives a Moonbuggy and a tiny Mustang convertible on two side wheels; wins at the Craps table; struggles superbly with two hot-tempered vixens; rips off a woman's top bikini; substitutes a fake computer tape; tries to escape from a blazing coffin; and knocks what he thinks is the real Blofeld // For the audience, it's intended to function as a glorious reinstatement of Connery-Bond, avenging Tracy's murder...\n\nJill St. John is the free agent who defies Bond's charm, but is reduced to a weak heroine, as she displays none of the class we've come to expect of a Bond girl... Nevertheless this redheaded diamond smuggler becomes the first American Bond beauty who does know how to wear a 'nice little nothing.' Jill inspires the best line in the movie...\n\nCharles Gray becomes the third actor to portray a wildly sophisticated Blofeld on-screen following Donald Pleasance and Telly Savalas\u0085 He succeeds as the reclusive tycoon Ernest Stavro Blofeld who creates doubles of himself to confuse Commander Bond... He hates martial music and takes no chances with his staff... His hit men are \"gay and fun,\" Mr Kidd and Mr Wint... Putter Smith is the sadistic Mr Kidd and Bruce Glover is his sinister sidekick Mr Wint\u0085 Jimmy Dean plays the multimillionaire Willard Whyte unaware that his company is being improperly used by Blofeld for his devil scheme for world domination...He is held prisoner in his desert mansion which is protected by two female karate experts nicknamed Bambi and Thumper...\n\nLana Wood becomes the glamorous society girl who meets Bond at a Las Vegas crap table\u0085 One night she barely had enough time to remove her top, and gets an undeserved but chilling sendoff...\n\nDesmond Llewelyn is Bond's gadget man, Q, who tries out an electromagnetic controller for his own amusement that makes an entire raw of slot machines hits jackpots...\n\nLois Maxwell is, as always, the loving Moneypenny in emigration uniform, this time, who still is aching for a diamond ring; Bernard Lee is the imposing 'M' who assigns 007 to infiltrate the smuggling ring and find out who was stockpiling stolen diamonds; Norman Burton is the CIA agent Felix Leiter who greets Bond and asks which part of the stiff holds the gems; Joseph F\u00fcrst is the brilliant scientist Dr Metz, who thinks that Blofeld is a mankind's benefactor, and a believer in world disarmament; and Bruce Cabot is Whyte's treacherous right-hand-man...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000125/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sean Connery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0000125?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Bond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0336509/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charles Gray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0336509?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Blofeld"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212818/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jimmy Dean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0212818?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Willard Whyte"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809623/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Putter Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0809623?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mr. Kidd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0123680/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Norman Burton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0123680?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Leiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496866/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bernard Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0496866?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "'M'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0056536/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Leonard Barr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0056536?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Shady Tree"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0479941/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Margaret Lacey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0479941?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Whistler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001762/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jill St. John"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0001762?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tiffany Case"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0939836/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lana Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0939836?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Plenty O'Toole"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0127677/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bruce Cabot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0127677?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Saxby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0323098/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bruce Glover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0323098?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mr. Wint"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0299822/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joseph F\u00fcrst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0299822?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dr Metz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005155/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Desmond Llewelyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0005155?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "'Q'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561755/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lois Maxwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066995/characters/nm0561755?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Moneypenny"}]}]}

The Meyrowitz Stories utilises Adam Sandler in what is likely his best defined work along with the magnificent cast of Dustin Hoffman, Ben Stiller and Elizabeth Marvel. What The Meyrowitz stories does so well is to portray such a realistic yet witty dysfunctional family with a deeper discussion on sibling rivalry and the need to be wanted/needed. All wrapped up in a cozy package that is the Meyrowitz Stories. \n\nWatching the Meyrowitz Stories certain feel this way, it is a slow unraveling of these different story lines that tie in into a beautiful bundle. While certain cut-offs of scenes may feel disruptive to some I found it well chosen and deliberate. \n\nThe performances given in this film were so relatable, familiar and hence warm and enjoyable. This viewing experience really feels like peering into someone's life and the emotions were so realistic and relatable. Once again thanks to the amazing performances, particularly the relationship/chemistry between Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller. Something that we certainly don't often get from Sandler, in fact he often has so little chemistry he is unable to create chemistry between himself and himself in his infamous work 'Jack and Jill'. So, kudos to this film, Sandler and Stiller. \n\nI very much enjoyed the unravelling of the dysfunctional relationship caused mainly by the central patriarch of the film portrayed by Dustin Hoffman. But, then even more enjoyable is seeing the progressing of the film and the slow amending of the relationship between the characters. \n\nI will say that one particular scene did throw me off as too edgy and unnecessary brining be out of the film and stopping the momentum that it has built up. A specific scene regarding the character of Eliza Meyrowitz(Grace Van Patten) showing Danny Meyrowitz(Adam Sandler) her film school project. On the one hand I understand that the Meyrowitz Stories is shooting on the film community but that particular scene to me just felt completely out of place and unfortunately distasteful.\n\nNonetheless, the film is a heartwarming and enjoyable good time.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi477870361", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM4MjQ0NTAtMmYwMS00MjExLWE2OGYtYjAwZTE4OWI5MzViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM4MjQ0NTAtMmYwMS00MjExLWE2OGYtYjAwZTE4OWI5MzViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An intergenerational tale of adult siblings (Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, and Elizabeth Marvel) contending with the long shadow their strong-willed father (Dustin Hoffman) has cast over their lives.", "uploadDate": "2017-09-20T16:20:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001191/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Adam Sandler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm0001191?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Danny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000163/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dustin Hoffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm0000163?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Harold"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000668/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emma Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm0000668?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Maureen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4311436/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Adam David Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm4311436?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9009887/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hannah Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm9009887?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "MOMA Employee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0589182/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rebecca Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm0589182?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Loretta"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3348582/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Cromer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm3348582?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Glenn Twitchell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0357979/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Josh Hamilton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm0357979?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Loretta's Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2665105/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Grace Van Patten"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm2665105?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eliza"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0555500/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elizabeth Marvel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm0555500?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2974069/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Danny Flaherty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm2974069?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marcus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3845878/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ronald Peet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm3845878?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002139/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Judd Hirsch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5536736/characters/nm0002139?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "L.J.

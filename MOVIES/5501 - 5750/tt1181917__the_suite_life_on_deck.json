I really liked the show before they made on deck. And even though they took out some of the good actors they got new ones which weren't so bad. Cole and Dylan still do a great job on the show and keep there character as if its not supposed to be new. London is still kinda funny but a little more retarded in my opinion. The new actors are alright, there's bailey who's a pretty good addition kind of funny and pretty much the (hot) girl of the show, and then there's Woody who is pretty crazy and like a wild card. I was a little worried at first that they had said the show was going to be completely different. But its the same old Zack and Cody and the other actors that moved on which really made me happy. I also want to point out that I am sure a majority of kids are watching the episodes on the computer and not the T.V. so there are a lot of viewers. The Beginning theme is pretty catchy, like the suite life. Sometimes the jokes can be corny and the laughing background clip is unnecessary. But the show mostly makes me laugh.

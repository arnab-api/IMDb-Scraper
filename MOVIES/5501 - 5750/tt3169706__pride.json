Many stand out, to the point where everyone stands out. My personal favourite performances are probably Dominic West's because of his wonderful energy, fantastic delivery and that the fact that he was playing a gay men (and was significantly less creepy than his Fred West performance) and Jessica Gunning's who played her play with such warmth and fire. That said, Staunton, Nighty and Schnetzer et all had some determination as well, it really is that not to want to give individual props to all.\n\nBritish humour tends to be our best selling point and this film lays bare just how raw and witty we can be in our dialogue when handling such powerful drama. That said, the film is a very difficult viewing experience, in my eyes. The Miners Strike alone is a very raw and sad event for all to see, especially when there will be absolutely no surprises as to the outcome. On top of this there is a plethora of tragic LGBT issues that further hit the viewer like a fist throughout, be it a family not accepting their gay son, the Miners' refusal to fully support the LBGT community when the going gets tougher (the bleakness of those scenes are particularly devastating), the start of AIDS and the knowledge that these men's lives will never be the same, the occasional violence shown to the gay men\u0085 the list really does go on. The fact that there is a strong undercurrent of humour throughout is particularly needed and welcomed, although towards the end it proves hard to laugh at. Many look back to the 80s with total joy, but for many people, they were uncertain, intensely painful years to survive in. This movie is a tribute to them, and the cast and crew provide their joie de vivre with an open, pulsating heart.\n\nWatch this preparing to feel a wide variety of emotions.

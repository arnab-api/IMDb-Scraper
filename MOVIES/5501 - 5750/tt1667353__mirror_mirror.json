A comedic version is interesting and new.\n\nI can only comment on Mirror Mirror because I saw it and I enjoyed it. Snow White (Lily Collins) is treated horribly by her wicked stepmother The Queen (Julia Roberts) who is ruling the kingdom since her father's mysterious death. Somehow with the help of the dwarfs and the Prince (Armie Hammer), Snow White begins to believe in herself and realizes she has the strength to fight off the wicked Queen.\n\nIt was a really nice retelling of Snow White because it was a coming of age story. Never knew who Lily Collins was before this movie, but I think she was spot-on as Snow White. She has this innocent beauty that was perfect for Snow White, but she also was courageous, which is a great role model for young girls nowadays. Might I add, her eyebrows fit her and there is nothing wrong with them as I've seen nasty comments about it. They add distinction to her face.\n\nThe Prince was really comical and funny. Had me laughing a lot. Never knew who Armie Hammer was before this movie also. I liked him because it was the opposite from Disney Princes who usually are perfect in every way without flaws. They can sing, dance,and sword fight, but he was pretty dense in a way, but it actually suited the movie and it was intended to be that way.\n\nLast but not least, Julia Roberts was divine as the wicked Queen. Honestly, I love her bitchy and sneering her nose at everyone. Julia is usually seen as this sweetheart but it was great to see this side of her. I liked her little on and off British accent too and her pompous narration to the story.\n\nLove the dwarfs, they had absolutely the best one liners. They were modern and jazzed stuff up.\n\nSo again I add, every movie does not have to be sinister and Hannibal Lector evil for it to be considered a good movie. Nor does it have to have The Hangover- type jokes and vulgarity to be considered worthy of laughter.\n\nThe critics can go to hell on this one. I will watch this movie again and again, especially with my niece.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3708919321", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMTk4MDE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5NDEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMTk4MDE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5NDEzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An evil queen steals control of a kingdom and an exiled princess enlists the help of seven resourceful rebels to win back her birthright.", "uploadDate": "2011-11-17T11:56:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000210/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Julia Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0000210?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "The Queen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2309517/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Armie Hammer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm2309517?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Prince Alcott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0696015/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jordan Prentice"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0696015?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Napoleon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1845172/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joe Gnoffo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm1845172?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Grub"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2083215/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sebastian Saraceno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm2083215?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Wolf"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1472251/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ronald Lee Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm1472251?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chuckles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001858/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mare Winningham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0001858?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Baker Margaret"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000293/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sean Bean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0000293?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "King"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2934314/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lily Collins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm2934314?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Snow White"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001447/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nathan Lane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0001447?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brighton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0693957/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mark Povinelli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0693957?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Half Pint"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940173/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Danny Woodburn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0940173?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Grimm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0458514/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Martin Klebba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0458514?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Butcher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3016166/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robert Emms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm3016166?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Charles Renbock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0503627/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Michael Lerner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1667353/characters/nm0503627?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Baron"}]}]}

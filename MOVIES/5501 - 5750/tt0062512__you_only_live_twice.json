It's a devilishly meaty Donald Pleasence who just seemed the part of Blofeld. Now who didn't love the hidden lair that was in an inactive volcano, and of course Blofeld's pool of pet piranhas. The inventive gadget novelty was really making a mark, just look the deadly mini-copter named 'Nelly' and the dangerous effects of smoking around others. Strangely enough the (witty) script seemed to spit out a few self-knowing quips involving cigarettes, which became rather odd. Director Lewis Gilbert (who would go on to control the very similar in story-structure \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" and then following that the plain goofy \"Moonraker\") does a tersely capable job with a fast moving pace that shifted from one well organized set-piece to another (like the chase on-top of a rooftop in a fishing docks that's masterfully captured by cinematographer Freddie Young) to finally finish on a barnstorming climax (with none other than ninjas) and then a familiarly fitting final frame. Sean Connery might look a little tired (a bit funny trying to make himself look like Japanese under make-up), but remains just as charismatic and fittingly lean when it came to getting down and dirty (Bond and his tussle with Blofeld's massive henchman Hans comes to mind). The bond girls shape up nicely in the form of Akiko Wakabayashi, Mie Hama and the stunning German redhead Karin Dor. Tetsur\u00f4 Tanba was good as Bond's Japanese counterpart. Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn treat us to their iconic roles. John Barry's classy music score has a smoothly oriental touch, which can get actively copious when called for and theme song \"You Only Live Twice\" is enticingly sung by Nancy Sinatra.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000125/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sean Connery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0000125?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Bond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0357240/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mie Hama"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0357240?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kissy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0793574/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Teru Shimada"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0793574?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mr. Osato"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000587/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Donald Pleasence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0000587?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Blofeld"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561755/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lois Maxwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0561755?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Miss Moneypenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0336509/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Charles Gray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0336509?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Henderson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0537990/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Peter Fanene Maivia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0537990?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Car Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0159485/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Chow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0159485?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Spectre 4"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0906686/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Akiko Wakabayashi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0906686?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848533/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tetsur\u00f4 Tanba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0848533?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tiger Tanaka"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0233312/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Karin Dor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0233312?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Helga Brandt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496866/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bernard Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0496866?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "'M'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005155/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Desmond Llewelyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0005155?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "'Q'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0157796/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tsai Chin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0157796?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Chinese Girl - Hong Kong"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0477297/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Burt Kwouk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062512/characters/nm0477297?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Spectre 3"}]}]}

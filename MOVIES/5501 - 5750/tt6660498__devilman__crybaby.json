Go Nagai was also creating TV Shows for kids (like Gurendaizer - Goldorak -, BomberX and Mazinger Z), so a manga as dark, crude and violent as DevilMan from the same author can be quite unsettling. However, the anti-war theme that we find in most works of Nagai is present here nonetheless, yet the exposition of this discourse involves a lot of disturbing violence. Graphically, this adaptation may look quite different from the original work of Nagai, it is narratively very faithful to the source material. The storyline follows the manga, but modernizes a lot of things in the storytelling. Smartphones, internet, social networks, among other things are included seamlessly in the plot without denaturing it, on the contrary, it adds a lot to the message of the original work. The unique animation and direction style of Yuasa adds a lot to the freshness of the overall experience. \n\nHowever, this is still DevilMan, it is raw, harsh, there is abuse, sex, drugs, nudity and violence. The overall experience is a cruel, nihilistic, emotional rollercoaster. The story is quite grandiloquent, and we can still feel a certain narration style from the 70s. But it is definitely a good anime that reminds of pre-2000s mangas, when nothing was ever half-baked if it serves the discourse. \n\nIf you are prone to get offended, do not watch DevilMan, but if what I said above still appeals to you, go watch it ! It's damn good. (no pun intended)\n\nI am happy that Netflix supports this kind of uncensored productions. I've recently watched \"The end of the F***ing World\" and \"Black Mirror Season 4,\" it definitely feels good to have more things with substance on Netflix recently, and DevilMan Crybaby is definitely on the Anime side of this good wave that makes me like Netflix again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Devilman: Crybaby", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3709123865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU4N2E3ZGItZGI4Zi00YmYwLWI0OTctYjRkODY1OWRmZjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTU4N2E3ZGItZGI4Zi00YmYwLWI0OTctYjRkODY1OWRmZjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Devilman: Crybaby", "uploadDate": "2019-04-11T08:36:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2146022/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Koki Uchiyama"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm2146022?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Akira Fudo (2018)"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4232585/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Griffin Burns"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm4232585?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Akira Fudo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4751364/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Megumi Han"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm4751364?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Miki Makimura (2018)"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1840556/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ami Koshimizu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm1840556?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Miko Kuroda"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8826387/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jun'ya Hirano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm8826387?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Moyuru Koda"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3423599/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Afra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm3423599?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4986852/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ayumu Murase"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm4986852?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ryo Asuka (2018)"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2550198/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kyle McCarley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm2550198?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ryo Asuka"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2583829/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cristina Valenzuela"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm2583829?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Miki Makimura"}, {"url": "#", "name": "9 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0473873/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cherami Leigh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm0473873?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Miko Kuroda"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11261159/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ken The 390"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm11261159?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Wamu"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1878161/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Subaru Kimura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6660498/characters/nm1878161?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gabi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "5 episodes, 2018"}]}]}

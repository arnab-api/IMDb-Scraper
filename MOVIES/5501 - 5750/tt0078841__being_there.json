That makes his portrayal of Chauncey Gardner that much more amazing, because he portrays a very simple man totally comfortable within himself.\n\nBeing There is a great film. It deals with a simple premise - if you act in a certain way, people will make unquestioned assumptions about you. Chauncy is slow witted and has the mind of small child, and all that he knows in gardening. However, he dresses in nice suits, has impeccable manners and is not shy, so he is accepted into social circles. When he speaks of gardening, his ramblings are mistaken for metaphors and he is instantly considered an economic genius.\n\nThis is wrapped around a beautiful film, in which Chauncey wanders from one circumstance into another, never changing his demeanor, never faltering. I an reminded of Mr Magoo walking blindly down a succession of steel girders thinking they are stairs. Essentially, he is not in peril because he does not know he is in peril. The charm of this film exists in Chauncey's unwavering personality, and how it affects the world of phonies and bureaucrats he has come to inhabit.\n\nAlthough the film sometimes comes across as forced, and some of the encounters with Eve (Shirley MacLaine) come off forced, the film is still a masterpiece. Its theme and Sellers' stunning performance lauch it into the catoegory of greatness.\n\nThere is much debate amongst the lovers of this film over its final scene. If you have not seen it, rent it, and draw your conclusions. Like many great movies steeped in mood and metaphor, we are left to draw our own conclusions.\n\nThe phrase \"I like to watch\" has become so famous from this movie - it refers to Chauncey's love for TV and the fact that it is his reference point for his existance. (Such has when he tries to click a remote to thwart off muggers). But there is a great deal more to Being There. It is a Top 10 Selection of 70s, Hal Ashby's best film and Peter Sellers greatest performance. **** out of ****.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H10M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Being There", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi489947929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3YjI4MTQtOTRhZi00Y2U1LWI4NmYtYmU1YjhhMzQ2NDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM3YjI4MTQtOTRhZi00Y2U1LWI4NmYtYmU1YjhhMzQ2NDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "One of Peter Sellers finest and final roles as an unassuming gardener who is mistaken for a brilliant philosoper", "uploadDate": "2009-01-29T06:12:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000634/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Sellers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0000634?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chance"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002048/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Melvyn Douglas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0002048?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Benjamin Rand"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0246004/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richard Dysart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0246004?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. Robert Allenby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0040984/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ruth Attaway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0040984?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Louise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0109329/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Fran Brill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0109329?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sally Hayes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0120770/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Oteil Burbridge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0120770?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lolo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0180962/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Brian Corrigan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0180962?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Policeman by White House"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0414193/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Don Jacob"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0414193?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000511/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Shirley MacLaine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0000511?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eve Rand"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0912001/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jack Warden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0912001?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "President 'Bobby'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000865/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Richard Basehart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0000865?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Vladimir Skrapinov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0166359/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Clennon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0166359?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Thomas Franklin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0239180/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Denise DuBarry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0239180?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Johanna Franklin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0445571/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ravenell Keller III"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0445571?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Abbaz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0112982/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alfie Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078841/characters/nm0112982?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Old Woman asked for lunch"}]}]}

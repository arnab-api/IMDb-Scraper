Believe me it is not ! The shame of it is, is that by it's end I can see at the heart of it was an interesting story, but this story was told in the least fascinating way possible. Everything about this is dull, the script, the performances, the pace. I kept watching out of curiosity and struggled to stay awake the whole time. As a photographer , I was in awe at how nice the movie looks and professional. Everything else said \"amateur\". Honestly there is little at all to see here. You could open up a book of interesting photographs and get more substance than what is put on the screen. I wish I had read reviews before watching as I feel like a chunk of my life has been wasted.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Pond [Trailer]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1426702105", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNlNGExODAtZjAzNy00YTY5LWJjMzAtOTE5YjYyMmE0YzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNlNGExODAtZjAzNy00YTY5LWJjMzAtOTE5YjYyMmE0YzRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer for The Pond (2020)", "uploadDate": "2019-12-31T14:35:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5062737/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Marco Canadea"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10739160/characters/nm5062737?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Professor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4966038/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Leslie Soo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10739160/characters/nm4966038?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Abby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4234031/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Paul Leonard Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10739160/characters/nm4234031?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chess player"}]}]}

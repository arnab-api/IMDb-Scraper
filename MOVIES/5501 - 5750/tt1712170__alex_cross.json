It was a good enough movie to pay the $5.75 matin\u00e9e price. The movie had decent action scenes, which is totally out of the norm for Tyler Perry, that kept me entertained. The acting in this movie was pretty good and Tyler Perry himself did do a pretty good job with his part especially being that this is his first action roll. But with all that being said I still can see why Morgan Freeman turned the roll down. This movie was kind of predictable. I was telling my wife what was going to happen in the movie and I hadn't seen this movie before hand, done any research on this movie nor have I heard anyone talking about pieces of the movie. Now I've seen some of Tyler Perry's movies and those ones I have seen is what keeps me from watching his other movies, but this one, although he didn't make this one, is better than anything else he played in. Except Why Did I Get Married. So If you're not doing anything on a Sunday afternoon and want to see a little action and a little suspense it's O.K. to go and see this one.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Exclusive Debut", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3041501721", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMTM2MjE1NDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDUzMzE5OTc@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMTM2MjE1NDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDUzMzE5OTc@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After Washington DC detective Alex Cross is told that a family member has been murdered, he vows to track down the killer.

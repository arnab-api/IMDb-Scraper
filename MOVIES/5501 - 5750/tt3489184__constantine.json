A true gem and a revolution in bringing the less glorified and star spangled yet utterly brilliant comic characters to life. I've been a fan of hellblazer since i was a kid, the dark creepy twisted plots and the always witty John Constantine, always having an ace up his sleeve, always surviving. The charisma the actors exude, the level of believability is very carefully plotted and the true comic genre is employed quite fantastically. Hope this show runs long alongside the spangled spandex runners and proves that u don't need hugely popular and socially feasible hero characters to come up with a brilliant show. I'll give it 10, yes, for being true to Constantine, and especially for holding no bars, may it be gore , creepiness, nudity or just the plain simple religious incantations. Absolutely Promising and spine chilling.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"Watch Tonight\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2385751833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MDc2MDE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4NzExMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2MDc2MDE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4NzExMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "\"Constantine\" debuts tonight at \"Grimm\" on NBC.", "uploadDate": "2014-10-25T10:18:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1790682/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt Ryan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3489184/characters/nm1790682?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Constantine"}, {"url": "#", "name": "13 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1918575/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ang\u00e9lica Celaya"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3489184/characters/nm1918575?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zed Martin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0674782/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Harold Perrineau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3489184/characters/nm0674782?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Manny"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0355155/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Charles Halford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3489184/characters/nm0355155?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chas Chandler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}]}

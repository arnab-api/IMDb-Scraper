Its dialogues are hilarious. Each character is an individual. Austin is a performer and you can see that Ross Lynch feels good on the stage. He doesn't need to act, he feels the moves. A lot of people are pointing out, that he is playing hot guy that is not hot. His cheeky smile is adorable, I don't think he is meant to be hot. He is meant to be cute. Ally is adorable and dorky character that reminds me of Zooey Deschanel's character Jess from FOX's New Girl. Very adorkable. Austin and Ally's chemistry is beyond amazing. They remind me of Brennan and Booth on Bones or Castle and Beckett on Castle as teenagers. Trish and Dez are the funny duo, reminding me of Scooby Doo characters. Dez would pull a pretty good Shaggy. I find it much more enjoyable show then was Hannah Montana or Wizards of Waverly Place. Those ones were just boring, comparing to Austin & Ally.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3608788505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjI5ZGU2ZWUtMjgzNi00YjE1LTk0NWItMTFmZWE1NWQ5ZDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjI5ZGU2ZWUtMjgzNi00YjE1LTk0NWItMTFmZWE1NWQ5ZDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Following the lives of Austin, an aspiring confident musician, Ally, a quiet talented songwriter and their two friends.", "uploadDate": "2020-06-30T10:30:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3515425/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ross Lynch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1830491/characters/nm3515425?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Austin Moon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 2011-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2263115/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Raini Rodriguez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1830491/characters/nm2263115?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Trish De la Rosa"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 2011-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1404824/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laura Marano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1830491/characters/nm1404824?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ally Dawson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 2011-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1101127/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Calum Worthy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1830491/characters/nm1101127?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dez"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 2011-2016"}]}]}

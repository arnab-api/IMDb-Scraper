However i feel that the current series is really de-grading to the previous series. What i mean is that it's is just not as good as it once was. I feel that now the show has been axed, it is just too over due. Blue Heelers has definitely run it's course and in my opinion should have ended with the death of Maggie Doyle (Lisa McCune). The reasons for this is because Magggie was Blue Heelers, she was indisputably the most successful cast memeber and really captured the audience and was the 'golden girl' in Mount Thomas. Her sudden death was devastating and should have resulted in the show being canceled."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0939801/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108709/characters/nm0939801?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Senior Sgt.

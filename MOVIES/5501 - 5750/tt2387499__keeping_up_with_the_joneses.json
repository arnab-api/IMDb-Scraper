The highlight of the film is certainly the connection and chemistry between the four main cast members, all of the individual relationships between Zach Galifanakis, Isla Fisher, Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot is what makes this movie watchable. They all have great comedic timing with one another, it was clear they had trust in each other.\n\nI did feel the plot did not go as far as a viewer would expect a film about spies to go. The final act is very underwhelming, as we are expecting this big blow out, but it actually ends up being very straight forward and predictable, nothing shocking or truly exciting really occurs. \n\nAs well as that, it simply is not as funny as it should have been. I had higher hopes with a cast like this, I was expecting a laugh a minute sort of movie, but there are several scenes without a single good joke in there. The writing came across as somewhat lazy, as if they gave up halfway through. \n\nIt does show that a film that is verging on mediocrity can be saved simply by the sincere chemistry between its lead cast. While it is certainly flawed, Keeping up with the Joneses is still mindless fun, worth the watch if you are looking for a good comedy, but do not go out of your way to see it. \n\nA suburban couple discover their new neighbours are undercover spies. \n\nBest Performance: Jon Hamm", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2243802905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTMzNjg1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIzNTQyOTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTMzNjg1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIzNTQyOTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A suburban couple becomes embroiled in an international espionage plot when they discover that their seemingly perfect new neighbors are government spies.", "uploadDate": "2016-06-22T21:58:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0302108/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Zach Galifianakis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm0302108?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeff Gaffney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0358316/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jon Hamm"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm0358316?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tim Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0652663/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patton Oswalt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm0652663?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Scorpion"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0909768/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Matt Walsh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm0909768?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dan Craverston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2134407/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michael Liu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm2134407?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Yang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4551557/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dayo Abanikanda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm4551557?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cool Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7572401/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jack McQuaid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm7572401?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mikey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8525698/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ying He"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm8525698?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Lu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0279545/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Isla Fisher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm0279545?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Karen Gaffney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2933757/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gal Gadot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm2933757?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Natalie Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4388384/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ming Zhao"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm4388384?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Scorpion's Girlfriend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1185753/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Maribeth Monroe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm1185753?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Meg Craverston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242656/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kevin Dunn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm0242656?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Carl Pronger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8108897/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Henry Boston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm8108897?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Patrick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496899/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bobby Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2387499/characters/nm0496899?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ricky Lu"}]}]}

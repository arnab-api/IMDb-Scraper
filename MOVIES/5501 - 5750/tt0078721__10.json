The plot of course has composer George Webber (Dudley Moore) going through his midlife crisis all obsessed with the hot young women, thereby messing up his relationship with girlfriend Samantha (Julie Andrews). I guess that if the movie has any problem, it's the casting of Moore. From everything that I've ever heard, it sounds like he was kind of worthless and undesirable to be around. Granted, in this movie he does a passable job as George, although it's hard to tell whether the movie is romanticizing or ripping at the LA lifestyle.\n\nAs for the movie's famous scene - Bo Derek in her swimsuit - I don't know what else to say. She later spoofed that scene in \"Tommy Boy\", but I don't know what else she's done recently except appear at the Republican National Conventions. And who on the set of \"Mary Poppins\" would have ever guessed that Julie Andrews would eventually star in this? Among the really funny scenes in my opinion are the wedding (and the events leading thereto), and what happens when George identifies himself as a Brit. In a way, Dudley Moore was expanding on his character from \"Foul Play\". Still, I think that we're probably doing Blake Edwards a favor if we remember him more for the \"Pink Panther\" movies. Also starring Dee Wallace (yep, ET's mom!), Brian Dennehy, and that guy at the end was character actor Don Calfa; you're sure to have seen him somewhere.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "10", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2545746201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY2MTA3MTMtZGZjNy00NGY5LWJkMGItZDQ4ZTA3MjIxN2U1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY2MTA3MTMtZGZjNy00NGY5LWJkMGItZDQ4ZTA3MjIxN2U1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:12:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001545/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dudley Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0001545?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Webber"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000137/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bo Derek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0000137?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jenny Hanley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0908914/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dee Wallace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0908914?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mary Lewis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001133/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brian Dennehy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0001133?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Donald"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0198502/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rad Daly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0198502?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Josh Taylor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0633595/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "James Noble"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0633595?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dr. Miles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0370013/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Hawker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0370013?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Covington"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0129883/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Don Calfa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0129883?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Neighbor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000267/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Julie Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0000267?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Samantha Taylor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0916434/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robert Webber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078721/characters/nm0916434?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hugh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429207/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sam J.

Why, and I am asking this as a German, why are German productions like this? For once, we didn't steal from Hollywood, I think, had a decent idea on a historically valuable building and its background and that's the outcome? Wow. We literally failed every film academy class one could think of. From script to special effects. Too bad. The idea was so good. Not original, we are talking about an asylum here, which literally created the horror genre, but good. Solid. If only they did a little more research on the patients, on the history. What a great movie this could've been. Not necessarily horror but drama.\n\nThe worst thing is people donated money so the film could be shot. In a crowd funding on the web!

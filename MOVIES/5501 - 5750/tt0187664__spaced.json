It's the closest thing to fanboy (and fangirl) heaven there is.  By that, I don't mean it's a perfect word for word film version of Lord of the Rings nor even a big BBC production of Asimov's Foundation trilogy.  No, this is where really good fanboys (and fangirls) go when they die.\n\nSet around the lives of Tim Bisley and Daisy Steiner sharing a ground floor flat somewhere in North London it shows in a disturbingly honest way the lives of the average late 20-something, recently moved to London, wannabe creative, painfully middle-class, skint people in much the same way that David Attenborough might bring to life the daily trials of a family of pandas.  Their many rituals and habits are studied in detail as they go about carving their way in the cruel world around them.  We see them go clubbing, going to sign on, in the pub, and rescuing dogs from animal testing laboratories.  The one thing that leads me to think that this is only a sitcom and not real life is that their flat is always suspiciously clean.\n\nAs Tim is a struggling graphic artist trying to break into the world of comic illustration, it's appropriate that the characters are all cartoons themselves.  They almost spew stylised behaviour, phrases and clothes. Some even have their own signature moves such as Brian's standardised description of his 'work' when he is asked what he paints.  The editing follows this lead with many cut-aways into people's thoughts much in the manner of a thought bubble.  The sheer quantity of cultural references is staggering. However, having lived a life similar to this, I know the number of cultural references in real life is at about the same level.\n\nIf you're currently aged between 27 and 34, this is the only sitcom you'll ever need to see again.  Well, Black Books is pretty good too.  Anyway, there are few things that make me laugh as much of this.  If you know the words to the Ewok song, watch this."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Spaced", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1374028057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDhhZDU5MzYtM2YxNS00YWE0LThmZmQtODQyYmY0ZDQ5YWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDhhZDU5MzYtM2YxNS00YWE0LThmZmQtODQyYmY0ZDQ5YWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-05-30T02:20:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0828961/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jessica Hynes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0187664/characters/nm0828961?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Daisy Steiner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 1999-2001"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0212626/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julia Deakin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0187664/characters/nm0212626?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marsha Klein"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 1999-2001"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372423/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mark Heap"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0187664/characters/nm0372423?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brian Topp"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 1999-2001"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1980098/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Aida the Dog"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0187664/characters/nm1980098?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Colin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "8 episodes, 1999-2001"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0670408/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Simon Pegg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0187664/characters/nm0670408?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tim Bisley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 1999-2001"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0296545/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nick Frost"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0187664/characters/nm0296545?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mike Watt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 1999-2001"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0138446/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Katy Carmichael"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0187664/characters/nm0138446?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Twist Morgan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 1999-2001"}]}]}

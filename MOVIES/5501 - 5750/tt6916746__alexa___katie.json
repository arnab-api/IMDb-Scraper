Cancer is an illness that people think of as the death illness. I was glad to have someone in my life that made me laugh and have fun with despite my ordeal. I've learned to walk and made it through this. Yes I've seen the worse side of it and people unless you know as a cancer patient you don't know what someone is feeling on the inside. Sometimes the only thing a person needs is a feeling of love and laughter instead of remorse and guilt and friends and family that only see the down side of it. They want their lives to be normal despite cancer. To the creators of this show great job. Having a great friend through this is great someone whose their to make you laugh when you want to cry someone whose there when you want to give up. So once again if you don't have it you shouldn't comment negative on this.

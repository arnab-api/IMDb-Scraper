Nowadays, I've learnt to view the film through more enlightened eyes, and appreciate it for the masterpiece that is most rightfully is.\n\nApart from the much-lauded 'exploding head' scene (which could have used a little more blood spattering everywhere) one of the film's most chilling scenes is at the very beginning when the lead character, Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) causes a woman to have a fit in a shopping mall before being captured by a pair of heavies. The scene was so convincingly played out that it really shock me up.\n\nThe more interesting aspect is the fact that most of these 'scanners'(or telepathic curiosities as the CEO of Consec calls them) are usually forced to live on the fringes of society as their telekinetic powers are feared and misunderstood by many. It would seem that the director, David Cronenberg, was using this plot device as a metaphor to comment on society's prejudicial attitudes towards the mentally ill. Like many of his low-budget horror films right up to 'The Fly' (1986) 'Scanners' has a very subversive, fly-on-the-wall take on society's ills. The modern society portrayed in 'Scanners' is a world viewed through the eyes of the outcast.\n\nThroughout the film, there is a general feeling of starkness, from the synthesiser-tinged score by Howard Shore, to the general sparse look of the film. This gives the viewer a rather apt feeling of coldness and isolation.\n\nMichael Ironside steals the show as the unhinged renegade scanner, Darryl Revok, who has a vast army of scanner converts at his disposal ready and willing to annihilate anyone unfortunate enough to stand in their way.\n\nThe only down side, however is the casting of Stephen Lack as Cameron Vale. Although he makes a fairly decent effort of playing his part, Lack just doesn't seem to have that much-needed 'spark' to bring his character to life.\n\nAll in all, 'Scanners' comes highly recommended as a 'must-see' feature.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi491175449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA2YTFhMDMtMjBjYS00NDI4LWFlYWItNTcyZjE3ODI4NzcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA2YTFhMDMtMjBjYS00NDI4LWFlYWItNTcyZjE3ODI4NzcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-24T17:19:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642198/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jennifer O'Neill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0642198?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kim Obrist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001526/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Patrick McGoohan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0001526?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Paul Ruth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000461/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael Ironside"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0000461?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Darryl Revok"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0111240/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lee Broker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0111240?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Security One"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0524970/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Adam Ludwig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0524970?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Arno Crostic"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230348/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Fred Doederlein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0230348?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dieter Tautz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0285405/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sonny Forbes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0285405?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Killer in Attic"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0480297/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Denis Lacroix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0480297?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Killer in Barn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0480099/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Stephen Lack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0480099?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cameron Vale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0199325/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lawrence Dane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081455/characters/nm0199325?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Braedon Keller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0798887/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Robert A.

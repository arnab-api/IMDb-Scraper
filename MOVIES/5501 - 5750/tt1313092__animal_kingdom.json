The audience, which was rustling noisy junk food through the previews, fell silent very quickly.\n\nJackie Weaver as the Matriarch of this crime family was amazing.\n\nIt felt a little \"talkie\" until about half way through, but there is tension right from the beginning that carries you through. Every character is connected to every other as if by springs quivering with tension or compression and the movie really delivers holding the resolution to the final frame where everything shifts into a new alignment.\n\nI really enjoyed Animal Kingdom, it does not glamorize the life of these crims the way Underbelly or Sopranos does, and the cops reflect the dirty history of the Melbourne's finest too (Guy Pearce reprising his role in LA Confidential as a rare Mr Clean). Overall I think David Simon (The Wire) would approve of Animal Kingdom.\n\nAnyone who has wondered how murderers can be loved by their Moms (isn't that most everyone?) should see this movie, it isn't a TV experience it really works well on the big screen.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Animal Kingdom", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi632030745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA2NDczNzI4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA2NDczNzI4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUwNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Welcome to the Melbourne crime underworld, where tensions are on the brink of exploding between felons and renegade cops.

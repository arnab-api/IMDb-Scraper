After all, Wonder Woman was one of 2017's best pictures, so I figure the title of this movie (as well as the well done poster) was a way to get butts into the seats. Not that I want my money back, cause it was an excellent movie. It was lots of fun and it made me chuckle a lot of times, but if your here because you want to learn more about Wonder Woman, the movie is not designed like that specifically. \n\nWhat I knew about William Marston before was that he created Wonder Woman (right!), the same guy who created Wonder Woman created the lie detector test (But the movie does point out how much his wife contributed to this) and that the original Wonder Woman comics was filled with images of bonding and S&M (Which according to the movie visualized Marston's theories on human behavior) . What I did not know is that this guy was in a three way relationship with his wife and one of his students. This part of the movie seems to take center stage above anything else. \n\nOnce again ,I'm not complaining, cause it made for one of the most interesting love stories I've ever seen. Not really into romance movies, and you can make an argument that it's not, but what stands out for me in this film is a story about three people trying to be in a loving relationship with one another in a world that's still not really ready for what is going on here. So, it was a romance film done differently, under a mask of \u00a0the drama and the biography( How very Superhero-like of them).\n\nhttp://cinemagardens.com/?p=1732", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New York Comic Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi678344985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTkyZGM0ZDgtOTBiZi00MjI1LWE4NmYtMDZhYTAxNjY0OTkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTkyZGM0ZDgtOTBiZi00MjI1LWE4NmYtMDZhYTAxNjY0OTkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The story of psychologist William Moulton Marston, the polyamorous relationship between his wife and his mistress, the creation of his beloved comic book character Wonder Woman, and the controversy the comic generated.", "uploadDate": "2017-10-08T18:03:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1812656/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Luke Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm1812656?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "William Moulton Marston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2757333/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bella Heathcote"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm2757333?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Olive Byrne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0320350/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Monica Giordano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm0320350?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3580129/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Conroy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm3580129?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brant Gregory"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0145299/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Maggie Castle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm0145299?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dorothy Roubicek"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4016260/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sharon Kubo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm4016260?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1836650/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Christopher Jon Gombos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm1836650?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fred Stewart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1689759/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stacy Fischer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm1689759?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Linda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0356017/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rebecca Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm0356017?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Elizabeth Marston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0110168/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Connie Britton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm0110168?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Josette Frank"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0270625/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "JJ Feild"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm0270625?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Charles Guyette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001624/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Oliver Platt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6133130/characters/nm0001624?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "M.C.

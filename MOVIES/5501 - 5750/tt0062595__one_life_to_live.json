I have become very fond of all of the characters in Llanview and the actors who portray them with such emotion, humor, and believability! I cannot fathom that ABC has actually canceled this Soap. It is the best on TV! The writing is fantastic, the story lines keep you on edge of your seat, and the acting is superb! Soap actors are the hardest working in the business. I will not know what to do when this goes off the air, in what...about a week or so? Why has no other channel picked up this show? What happened to it becoming an internet soap? Is there really no one out there with the money to invest who believes in these characters anymore? I just cannot imagine the day when there is no more Viki Lord Buchanan, no more Jessica and Natalie, no more Starr, Todd, Blair or Tea, no more John McBain or Bo Buchanan, or David Vickers Buchanan. Sadly, Dorian (Robin Strasser) has already left the show. I truly never thought the day would come when this happened. So, reality TV is cheap to produce. I despise reality TV and I do not and will not watch it. I shall miss One Life To Live for as long as I live!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer - 2013", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi459324953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRkMTcyZjAtOTJmYS00MTQ5LTliZGItN2IwMDUzZjllNTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRkMTcyZjAtOTJmYS00MTQ5LTliZGItN2IwMDUzZjllNTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "One Life to Live centres takes place in the fictional town of Llanview, PA.around the wealthy Lord family, and the middle-class Woleks and Rileys.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-29T10:31:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0805785/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Erika Slezak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062595/characters/nm0805785?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Victoria Lord"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,193 episodes, 1971-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0247727/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Easton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0062595/characters/nm0247727?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John McBain"}, {"url": "#", "name": "888 episodes, 1999-2012"}]}]}

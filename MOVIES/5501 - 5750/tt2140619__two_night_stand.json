She graduated from college with a degree she doesn't want and spends her days at home doing nothing. When she tries on-line dating she meets Alec (Teller) and the two meet and share a night together. When she tries to leave in the morning she is surprised by a snowstorm that has forced them to spend more time together. What starts off has two people that hate each other soon grows into something else. This is just a good movie. The writing is witty and funny and the actors have great chemistry together. The movie is totally predictable and very cookie cutter but that in no way hurts the movie. The younger crowd may like this more than an older one but I am 36 and really enjoyed this and so did my wife. The dialog is funny and there is a lot of truth to what is said. There are some really funny parts in this and I laughed a lot all the way through. Overall, a very smartly written romantic comedy that I really enjoyed. I surprisingly give this an A-.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H26M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi874163225", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxOTgwMDE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI4MjA0MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxOTgwMDE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI4MjA0MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Twenty-something New Yorkers Megan and Alec are trapped together in Alec\u00c2\u2019s Brooklyn apartment after what was supposed to be a no-strings attached, online hook-up.", "uploadDate": "2014-08-09T05:29:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3006818/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Analeigh Tipton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm3006818?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Megan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1221906/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jessica Szohr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm1221906?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Faiza"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2088745/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Berto Colon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm2088745?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bouncer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2860923/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kellyn Lindsay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm2860923?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Becca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1628079/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Leven Rambin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm1628079?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Daisy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2693238/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brian Petsos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm2693238?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brian Petsos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2418247/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeremy Rishe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm2418247?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Drunk Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1577985/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "David Weiss"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm1577985?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arresting Officer #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1886602/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Miles Teller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm1886602?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alec"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3264596/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kid Cudi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm3264596?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cedric"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4884880/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Josh Salatin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm4884880?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0795290/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Michael Showalter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm0795290?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rick Raines"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000725/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joey Lauren Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm0000725?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Customer Service Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3580129/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Chris Conroy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm3580129?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1497615/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Victor Cruz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2140619/characters/nm1497615?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Arresting Officer #1"}]}]}

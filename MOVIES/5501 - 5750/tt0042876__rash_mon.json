It is widely revered as one of the most influential films of all-time, but unlike some other movies, it is not a film that feels dated. The revolutionary methods of Kurosawa are still effective and on-par with the cinema of today -- this isn't a movie where you say, \"Yeah, fifty years ago it might have been different, but now it's done in all the movies.\" Kurosawa's techniques are still superior to most of his imitators. Look at the 2003 John McTiernan film, \"Basic,\" which copies a good portion of \"Rashomon's\" concept. Which is the better film? It's not a hard choice.\n\nThe film begins under a structure which reads \"Rashomon\" on its exterior, in a small Japanese village. It's raining outside and a woodcutter (Takashi Shumura) and a priest (Minoru Chiaki) inadvertently find themselves in the company of a wandering commoner (Kichijiro Ueda), and as he asks them what is the matter they both begin to relay the most horrific story they claim to know -- of a brutal murder a few days prior.\n\nKurosawa then switches to flashback and we see three different versions of the exact same event -- the slaying of an innocent man (the murderer played by Kurosawa film regular Toshir\u00f4 Mifune) in the woods outside the village. Was it because of lust? Betrayal? Envy? Or insanity? We hear from the murderer, the wife of the victim, and a woman channeling the spirit of the dead man.\n\n\"Rashomon\" is brilliant. Some people have complained that the ending is a cop-out and sentimental hogwash, but I think Kurosawa was fond of sentimentality to a point (he uses a good deal of it in \"Ikiru\") but the difference between what he does with sentimentality as opposed to many filmmakers of today is that he uses to to ENRICH the story, not provide an easy solution to all the problems.\n\nIs there resolution in the finale of \"Rashomon\"? To a degree. But, like \"Ikiru,\" it also leaves an open answer to its audience -- this film questions us, and our humanity, and it says something about the human condition and our weaknesses as a species. Yet it also proposes that along with the evil is an inherent good, and in my opinion the message of \"Rashomon\" is just as important and effective as its film-making techniques and acting.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Re-release Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi240959001", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ0ZThkZDAtM2Y3Ny00ZDNlLWI3NDktOWJkNDNiOTJhMTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ0ZThkZDAtM2Y3Ny00ZDNlLWI3NDktOWJkNDNiOTJhMTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The rape of a bride and the murder of her samurai husband are recalled from the perspectives of a bandit, the bride, the samurai's ghost and a woodcutter.", "uploadDate": "2020-08-17T12:49:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001536/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Toshir\u00f4 Mifune"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0042876/characters/nm0001536?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Taj\u00f4maru"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0605270/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Masayuki Mori"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0042876/characters/nm0605270?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Takehiro Kanazawa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0156928/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Minoru Chiaki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0042876/characters/nm0156928?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Priest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0393352/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Noriko Honma"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0042876/characters/nm0393352?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Medium"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0477553/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Machiko Ky\u00f4"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0042876/characters/nm0477553?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Masako Kanazawa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0793766/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Takashi Shimura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0042876/characters/nm0793766?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Woodcutter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0879918/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kichijir\u00f4 Ueda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0042876/characters/nm0879918?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Commoner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0441961/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Daisuke Kat\u00f4"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0042876/characters/nm0441961?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Policeman"}]}]}

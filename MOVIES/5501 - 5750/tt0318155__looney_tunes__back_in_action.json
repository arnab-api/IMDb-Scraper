Dante really knows this territory and his affection for the material is very apparent. He is the ONLY logical choice for the director (watch his older films for countless references to the Looney Tune gang). The humans are all game, but never upstage the real stars (Bugs and the Gang of course), rather they simply add to the film and give us at least a few flesh and blood characters for us to relate to. Fraser is once again both heroic and likable/goofy, Elfman is sexy and a bit cynical in fresh change of pace from her more docile \"Dharma\" character  from t.v. and Martin is like a human cartoon character himself. He hasn't been this \"out there\" and unpredictable since his celebrated stand-up days. He does anything but play it safe, and ends up with a memorable, if not a little eccentric performance. Timothy Dalton as Fraser's Dad is a real stand-out both referencing and spoofing his 007 past, without scuffing up himself or the good Bond name. The fact he plays it so straight really adds to the quality of his scenes and jokes (love the \"slapping himself\" scene!). There are some really inspired bits here; funny and clever. The scene in the Louvre was both gorgeous to watch and so funny I laughed harder than I have at the theaters for a while. The entire outer space sequence is also just jammed packed with so many great bits you'll need to see it twice just to take it all in. It's unfortunate this little gem of a flick has been gobbled up in the busy holiday release schedule, but fans should be pleased this film was made at all and will be able to own and enjoy it in the near future. I loved it, as did my 12 year old sister, my girlfriend and the theater I saw it with. Sad there will probably not be another large scale Looney production after this, but we have this one to treasure. I believe over time, and certainly on home video / DVD, Back in Action will find it's audience. Like all great cult films, it will probably take some time for it to be discovered, but fans will keep it alive. examples? Big Trouble in Little China, Tron, Buckaroo Banzai, Austin Powers, Swingers and F/X are just a handful of films that did very poor or just ok at the box office, but went on to great success on home video and in many cases garnered RABID cult followings that have made them favorites with fans even today.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Looney Tunes: Back in Action", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3549626649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhkNDMzZjAtNjg5MS00MzIwLWEyY2MtYjVjNTFhNjkxZWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhkNDMzZjAtNjg5MS00MzIwLWEyY2MtYjVjNTFhNjkxZWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:52:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000409/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brendan Fraser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0000409?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "DJ Drake"}, {"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0000409?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brendan Fraser"}, {"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0000409?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Voice of Tasmanian Devil and She-Devil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000188/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Steve Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0000188?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mr. Chairman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000181/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Heather Locklear"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0000181?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dusty Tails"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004966/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bill Goldberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0004966?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mr. Smith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822734/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dan Stanton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0822734?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Warner's Brother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000339/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Roger Corman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0000339?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hollywood Director"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0330298/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeff Gordon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0330298?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeff Gordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001862/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mary Woronov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0001862?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Acme VP, Bad Ideas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001184/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jenna Elfman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0001184?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001096/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Timothy Dalton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0001096?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Damien Drake"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000349/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joan Cusack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0000349?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822739/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Don Stanton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0822739?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mr. Warner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0588241/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dick Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0588241?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Security Guard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002994/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kevin McCarthy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0002994?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dr. Bennell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000498/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Matthew Lillard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318155/characters/nm0000498?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Matthew Lillard"}]}]}

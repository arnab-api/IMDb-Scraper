It's a slow burn about a young couple that go to (you guessed it!) a beach house for a romantic vacation together, only to find an older couple also staying at the beach house. For about half of the movie, things are okay - you're just watching a flawed relationship trying to fix itself and grow - but, when things go awry, they really go out with it.\n\nThis film has an uneasy feeling throughout. It gives off a vibe of unease, as though it were preparing the viewer for what is to come. There wasn't a moment of the film that I felt I could trust any particular characters, especially once the film really started revving its engine and working toward the final act.\n\nThere are a lot of tense moments in the film, which is one thing they pulled off really well. Where it lost me was in the plot, the way it suddenly (and I do mean suddenly) begins to get a little too sci-fi for my liking in a film like this. I'll give it credit for doing something different (it easily could've been very cliched) and trying to be its own thing, but it's an instance where I feel it, perhaps, tried a little too hard to be original and ended up being off-putting as the film went on.\n\nThat being said, credit needs to be given where it's due. Everyone acting in this film did a great job. The characters were relatable and believable. And the shots in this thing are absolutely stunning as well. The aesthetic of the film is eye-catching and beautiful throughout, which made it a film that was still enjoyable despite its faults.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2232073753", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmZDJjZWUtNTg0Mi00ZjNmLWI0MTAtYjEyMDU3ZTgzZWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmZDJjZWUtNTg0Mi00ZjNmLWI0MTAtYjEyMDU3ZTgzZWRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-13T09:52:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1882929/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Liana Liberato"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm1882929?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0916617/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jake Weber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm0916617?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mitch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10930142/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael Brumfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm10930142?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Police Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4470025/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Steven Corkin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm4470025?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Infected neighbor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4747762/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Veronica Fellman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm4747762?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Radio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7885187/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Noah Le Gros"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm7885187?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Randall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11692742/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Maryann Nagel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm11692742?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10930143/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Matt Maisto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm10930143?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Creature in basement"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8259300/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dan Zakarija"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10843306/characters/nm8259300?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "CB Radio Voice"}]}]}

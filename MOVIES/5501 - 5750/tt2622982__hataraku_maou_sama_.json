There is a lot to like about this show like the cast, the cast in this show was great everyone did a fantastic job playing there respected character. Speaking of characters the characters in this show are all amazing it's really hard to pick a favorite because all of the main characters are amazing. This show is also really really funny and each episode had me laughing from start to finish because of how ridiculous this show was and it's just the jokes in this show are so ridiculous in a good way and you can expect this show not to be taken seriously because it's about the devil working at McDonald's. The action in this show when it actually happens is really beautifully animated and really well done. The animation style is also really great and well animated. But as I said this anime is not perfect and there is some problems. To start with the villains are not interesting at all and they have no character development at all it just seemed like they put the villains for an action scene. Also the episodes 6-10 felt like they were copying the first 5 episodes in there tone yes they sometimes through some original things in there and episodes 8 and 9 I want to say had me dying of laughter but it just felt like a rehash of episodes 1-5 in some ways. Overall, if you want a really quick short show to watch look no farther then devil is a part timer. I had so much fun watching this 13 episode show and I really hope the second season comes out soon because I do want to return to this world and get to know more about these characters.",

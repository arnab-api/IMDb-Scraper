It's got all the elements, including a healthy dose of softcore sex scenes which surprised me because Amanda Seyfried has such an endearing, innocent look about her. But she's such a good actress though that this doesn't prevent her from convincingly playing the role of seductive call girl Chloe. Julianne Moore plays Catherine, a gynecologist who suspects her flirtatious husband (Liam Neeson) is having an affair with one of his students. While at work Catherine observes Chloe entering and exiting hotels with several men so she can make a pretty good guess at Chloe's profession. Catherine decides to use Chloe as bait to see if her husband would submit to the temptation of an affair with Chloe.\n\nAnd even though that is the basic storyline, there is so much more that is left unsaid; things Catherine thinks she knows but doesn't know about her husband, things Chloe knows about Catherine that Catherine herself doesn't even know; and in the middle of it all, the viewer who finds out we didn't know much at all about it all. The audience is pretty much kept in the dark as to what is really going on with Chloe until one small scene that immediately switches the direction of the movie. It's not one of those hokey melodramatic twists, but will definitely have you playing back the entire movie in your mind because it sheds everything in a new light. Chloe brags at the beginning of the film, in a voice-over narration, that she has the gift of intuiting what people want and need without it being said. She can be all things to all people. And unfortunately for Julianne Moore's character, Chloe is exactly right....just not in the way that you might initially think she is.\n\nWhat makes this movie good is that it has layers. Just as in real life, people are inevitably much different than what they appear to be on the surface. In a lesser film, the characters and plot would be one-dimensional and by far less interesting.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Chloe", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3782411289", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNTAzMzAxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY0ODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNTAzMzAxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY0ODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A doctor hires an escort to seduce her husband, whom she suspects of cheating, though unforeseen events put the family in danger.", "uploadDate": "2010-03-05T11:22:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000194/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Julianne Moore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1352824/characters/nm0000194?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Catherine Stewart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1086543/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amanda Seyfried"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1352824/characters/nm1086543?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chloe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0861075/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "R.H.

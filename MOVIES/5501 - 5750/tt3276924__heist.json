The script has several strengths. The characters are interesting and multifaceted and the dialogue is good. The characters are given backstories and complex histories with one another, but those histories aren't developed sufficiently for the audience to understand some of the choices the characters make. \n\nSome aspects seem contrived, such as the girl's critical illness and urgent need for surgery that somehow leaves her appearing healthy and rosy-cheeked, the hospital's ultimatum or the lack of other options like crowd-sourcing fundraisers. One plot device seemed much more appropriate in a 1990 Bill Murray comedy than a gritty action film. A feared gangster takes extraordinary steps to prevent anybody from ever imagine they can steal from him, but is robbed twice in a week. The casino seems to have less security for its cash than most casinos have on their alcohol. \n\nOne wishes filmmakers would take the time to do some rudimentary research. There are numerous images on Google of one million dollars in hundred-dollar bills. If half the money were in twenties, it would take up three times as much space. Used bills occupy possibly twenty percent more space than new bills. If a character runs around with a bag that's too small to hold the amount of money it's supposed to hold, people are likely to wonder where the rest of the money is. \n\nThe script has more holes than Emmentaler. At times the characters seem to act without any comprehensible motive. At other times, they have very real and believable motives. The script has a couple of nice twists, although they really need a better foundation than a brief allusion or quick background shot to make them seem believable. It would have been nice to get to know some of the passengers, particularly as they make choices that impact the outcome. \n\nWith a little more effort and development, it could have been a really good script. Strong performances by Morgan and De Niro and interesting turns by Bautista and Chestnut make the film a worthwhile viewing experience.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Heist", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3978934297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzYwNzAyMjItODgzOC00OWNhLWJhNTMtMDMwYjMwZTNmMGNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzYwNzAyMjItODgzOC00OWNhLWJhNTMtMDMwYjMwZTNmMGNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Heist", "uploadDate": "2018-03-10T17:10:01Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000134/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert De Niro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm0000134?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Francis 'The Pope' Silva"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1176985/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dave Bautista"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm1176985?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Cox"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2442289/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gina Carano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm2442289?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1055590/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lydia Hull"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm1055590?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pauline"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1737241/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stephen Cyrus Sepher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm1737241?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Julian Dante"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1476806/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tyler Jon Olson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm1476806?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Steve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5750163/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hawn Tran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm5750163?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3309959/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Renell Gibbs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm3309959?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tagger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0604742/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeffrey Dean Morgan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm0604742?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Luke Vaughn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0098378/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kate Bosworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm0098378?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sydney Silva"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004820/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Morris Chestnut"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm0004820?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Derrick 'Dog' Prince"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004971/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mark-Paul Gosselaar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3276924/characters/nm0004971?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Detective Marconi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000665/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "D.B.

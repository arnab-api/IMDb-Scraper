No matter what the scene is and no matter the how bad and offtrack it goes, the entire cast put 100 per cent of their creativity into it to make it absolutely hilarious! \n\nA special mention has to go, obviously, to Colin Mochrie (my personal favorite) and Ryan Stiles. They are the best comedy duo I have ever seen. As best friends, they take nothing seriously and never hesitate to insult each other (various bald jokes and big nose quirks are aplenty!) and host Drew Carey. And it's especially hilarious how annoyed Ryan gets with the Hoe Down's - by far the best game ever. Oh, and Colin's impressions also get a shout-out...plainly because he can't do any. But don't worry Colin, we love you still the same!\n\nThey brought improv comedy to the mass attention of the world and it's been ablaze ever since.\n\nSo massive congratulations and ongoing thank you's go to this remarkably talented cast and for their great effort at making the world a funnier and happier place!

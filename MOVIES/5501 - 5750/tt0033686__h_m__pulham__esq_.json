It contains, as far as I've seen her, Hedy Lamarr's best performance ever...she's luminous here, human, warm, heart-wrenching, not the aloof goddess of other MGM films (which I like too, by the way). She gives a complex, multi-layered performance as a liberal, independent, unprejudiced, modern working woman who falls in love with a lad (grandly impersonated by Robert Young) who comes from an aristocratic, old fashioned, \"blue-blood\" family from Boston.\n\nThey meet while working together in an advertising/publicity company, but their relationship is not an easy one, due to Marvin's (Hedy) unease with his family's morals, mores and ways...\n\nThe movie is told in flashback, with Harry Pulham (Robert Young) remembering his childhood and younger days, when he's well into his forties and married to a woman of his same \"Social Circle\" (Ruth Hussey-what a good actress she was, giving a first-rate performance in a role so different from the one she played the previous year in \"The Philadelphia Story\").\n\nYou can tell this movie was directed by a first rate director like King Vidor, who could handle so well \"sociological\" issues.\n\nGood performances too by Van Heflin as Young's pal, Bonita Granville as his sister, Charles Coburn as his father et al.\n\nAn engrossing film, watch it on TCM, where it's scheduled regularly."}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1503576345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAyNWM2MDItZWIyOS00YzQ4LTg4ZGEtYTZhM2RhMmMyMDBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAyNWM2MDItZWIyOS00YzQ4LTg4ZGEtYTZhM2RhMmMyMDBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A man who lived his life as he was was told he should, not as he would have chosen to, is brought out of his shell by a beautiful young woman.", "uploadDate": "2020-10-02T13:49:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001443/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hedy Lamarr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0001443?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Marvin Myles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0404046/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ruth Hussey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0404046?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kay Motford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001336/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Van Heflin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0001336?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bill King"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0335748/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bonita Granville"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0335748?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Pulham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0357111/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Charles Halton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0357111?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Walter Kaufman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0114436/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Phil Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0114436?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Joe Bingham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352774/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sara Haden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0352774?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Miss Rollo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001870/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Young"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0001870?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Harry Pulham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002013/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Charles Coburn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0002013?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mr. Pulham Sr."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390189/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fay Holden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0390189?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mrs. John Pulham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0939667/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Douglas Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0939667?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mr. Bullard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002063/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Leif Erickson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0002063?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rodney 'Bo-Jo' Brown"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167397/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "David Clyde"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0033686/characters/nm0167397?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hugh the Butler"}]}]}

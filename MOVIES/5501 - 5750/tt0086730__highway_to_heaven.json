He is assisted by Mark Gordon an Ex-Cop who's life he helped turn around, brilliantly played by Victor French. This show which is great for the entire family shows good morales and a lesson is learned every episode. Michael Landon's final public work before passing away (Us, never aired)touched millions of people including myself. I know of a LOT of people looking for this show and by the grace of god it is finally arriving on DVD. I urge you to spend the money on this product and share it with your families! A beautiful show waiting to be discovered by an entirely new generation is finally here! Let's go Johnathan and Mark, God has one more assignment for you...in DVD land!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Highway To Heaven: The Hero", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1104461081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjYzNmZTEtMDJhYy00ZWM1LWEwZDEtODE3OTk1NTQyMDM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjYzNmZTEtMDJhYy00ZWM1LWEwZDEtODE3OTk1NTQyMDM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Highway To Heaven: The Hero", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T09:05:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001446/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Landon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086730/characters/nm0001446?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jonathan Smith"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1984-1989"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0294229/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Victor French"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086730/characters/nm0294229?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mark Gordon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1984-1989"}]}]}

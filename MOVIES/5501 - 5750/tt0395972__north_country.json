The real story, he said, was the traumatic experience Josie had in high school, and her relationship with her son.\n\nTherefore he should have written a script for Lifetime focusing on what he felt was the \"real story\". He should not have used one of the most important cases for sexual harassment in legal history as the vehicle for telling this other story. \n\nThe producers should have demanded a script that more closely resembled Susannah Grant's Erin Brockovich. The sequence of victimization after victimization depicted in North Country didn't let us get to know Josie's character in any depth. We saw her slammed against the wall again and again, from beginning to end. We see that she stands up against the oppression, but we aren't taken into her sensibility, her choices, her process, her blind spots, character change, etc, etc, like in EB. Likewise, the lack of complexity in the male \"macho\" characters also flattens the story, and takes away from the real difficulties in challenging sexism and sexual harassment. In real life, character complexity of those who oppress or who defend oppressors is part of what makes the problem of sexual harassment difficult to fight. \n\nI read an interview with Niki Caro, and though I think she's a very talented director, I got the sense that she didn't really get the politics or history behind sexual harassment. It seems things aren't as bad in New Zealand as they are here in the U.S. This is a foreign culture to her, and Northern Minnesota is certainly a foreign culture. I wish she would have spent more time fully understanding the issues and cultural dynamics (including the accent and mannerisms of the area, etc, which were sprinkled into the movie, but not rigorously replicated) before undertaking the project. If she had gone the extra mile to immerse herself in the issue and the region, perhaps she would have demanded a total rewrite of the script.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "North Country", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi714998041", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFhMmI2NTUtYTNlNy00NzBjLWFmYzUtZWU1ZThmZTRiMTQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFhMmI2NTUtYTNlNy00NzBjLWFmYzUtZWU1ZThmZTRiMTQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:29:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000234/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlize Theron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0000234?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Josey Aimes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2008890/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elle Peterson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm2008890?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Karen Aimes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000293/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sean Bean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0000293?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719637/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jeremy Renner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0719637?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bobby Sharp"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000651/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sissy Spacek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0000651?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alice Aimes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005404/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rusty Schwimmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0005404?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Big Betty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1157358/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michelle Monaghan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm1157358?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sherry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035395/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jillian Armenante"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0035395?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Peg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0193524/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Thomas Curtis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0193524?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sammy Aimes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000531/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frances McDormand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0000531?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Glory"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bill White"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420955/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Richard Jenkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0420955?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hank Aimes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0128054/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "James Cada"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0128054?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Don Pearson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0256599/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Linda Emond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0256599?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Leslie Conlin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0377034/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Brad William Henke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0395972/characters/nm0377034?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lattavansky"}]}]}

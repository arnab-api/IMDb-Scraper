That said allow me to point out that the cute little girl who acts as badly as her speech impediment can't save the film in the same way that the Brady Bunch would not have been popular with a the show devoted to Cindy Brady. \n\nThere was so much wasted possibility showing us the back ground of these characters the over use of montage and collage editing would not have been needed. \n\nAlso the film has three apparent villains in the film except none of them are bad and we never know why two of them are necessarily considered bad- but that's o.k. because the story was written by someone with ADD or perhaps short term memory loss as significant as the character in \"Memento\".The story has no continuity- Tim Allen hates the kids he plays with the kids he feels sorry for the kids no wait he doesn't understand why he's there to train the kids_ FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE UP YOUR MIND!!! Nothing in this movie fit together- and in the end the super evil villain (whom we have waited 90 minutes to see) gets a scolding in the last 6 minutes of the movie and then it's over. \n\nDidn't Peter Hewitt read the script before filming oh no wait this is the same guy that gave us \"Bogus Journey\"- you remember- the sequel that ended the Bill and Ted franchise. Not to mention the Garfield Movie.. a comic strip so revered for 30 years they made it into a Saturday morning cartoon but the movie that couldn't keep the audiences attention for 90 minutes (success based solely on a lack of other children films during its release and parents who grew up with Garfield the previous generation)...WHY DOES PETER HEWITT GET WORK, why?? Afterall,it is the directors responsibility for many things including having a working script and a vision before starting a project ( the exceptions being Andy Warhol who's audience base was too stoned to notice and Francis Ford Coppola with \"Apocalypse Now\" who had several million dollars to keep his dream afloat. \n\nPeter Hewitt should be ashamed of himself for this crap.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3"}}, "duration": "PT1H23M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Zoom (2006)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2112028953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ3NDM3ZjYtOGFhYS00ZTU3LThhMmYtYTdlNjExODVlM2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ3NDM3ZjYtOGFhYS00ZTU3LThhMmYtYTdlNjExODVlM2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "pre st, \"This Summer\", \"August\", lbx", "uploadDate": "2008-04-18T12:21:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000741/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tim Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm0000741?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack Shepard"}, {"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm0000741?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain Zoom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000331/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chevy Chase"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm0000331?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Grant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0954225/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kevin Zegers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm0954225?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Connor Shepard"}, {"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm0954225?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Concussion"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1746980/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Cassidy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm1746980?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dylan West"}, {"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm1746980?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Houdini"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001800/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rip Torn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm0001800?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Larraby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1190373/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ashton Moio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0383060/characters/nm1190373?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Halloween Bully"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001855/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Thomas F.

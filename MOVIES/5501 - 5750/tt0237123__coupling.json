Comparing Coupling to Friends is comparing apples and oranges. They've both got three male and three female leads, and that's about the only similarity. To those who think that that's enough to call the two shows variations on the same theme I would like to say: congratulations, you can count to six. You are slightly smarter than a rabbit.\n\nFriends is about friendship. You could develop an allergy to hugging by just watching one episode. Coupling is about sexual attractiveness; how we exploit it and how we deal with getting stung by it. The jokes may be cheap at times, but the telling is never crude; nakedness is suggested, rather than shown.\n\nCoupling could have been, say, five gay guys and a straight one. The jokes would have worked as well (different jokes, of course), but then the series probably would have been compared to Kids in the Hall. Sigh. I guess I should just be glad that Coupling does not (yet) play in New York, because then we would be in a comparitivational quagmire.\n\nAlso, the Jeff character is not all that brilliant. Sure, he's the crackpot, the clown. They had them in circuses, you know? Where Seinfeld's Kramer is off the map, Jeff is just normal abnormal. The true funniness of this show--and it is funny, let me assure you of that!--stems from the sharp observations, and these are made by all the cast, including but not limited to Jeff.\n\nI liked Rob Belcher's review. He wrote: \"this show will speak to anyone who's ever dated, been in a relationship, or just noticed that men and women are different creatures.\" But if you really want to get a taste of the show, don't rely on these reviews, but visit the official web site, which has clips and quotes (including the 'breasts with brains' and 'sock gap' bits). Judge for yourself.\n\nIf you want to see similar British humour, I recommend \"Game On!\"\n\n(P.S. I like Friends too, but for totally different reasons, which is just as well, as it is a totally different show.)"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0202603/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack Davenport"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0237123/characters/nm0202603?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Taylor"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2000-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0018729/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sarah Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0237123/characters/nm0018729?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Susan Walker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2000-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0587060/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ben Miles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0237123/characters/nm0587060?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patrick Maitland"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2000-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0069109/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gina Bellman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0237123/characters/nm0069109?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jane Christie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2000-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411214/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kate Isitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0237123/characters/nm0411214?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sally Harper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2000-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185404/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Richard Coyle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0237123/characters/nm0185404?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jeffrey 'Jeff' Murdock"}, {"url": "#", "name": "22 episodes, 2000-2002"}]}]}

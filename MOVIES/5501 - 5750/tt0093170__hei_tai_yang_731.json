And the rumors were true. It contained both. But I wasn't expecting a seriously well-made movie.\n\nMen Behind the Sun centers around Squadron 731 and how it tortured and killed thousands and thousands of people so Japan would have a great chance at winning the war with Russia. Really the movie is almost entirely about how Squadron 731 can improve their chance to win the war. Be it through torture type situations like extreme temperature or through air-borne bacteria. It's been said that while Squadron 731 was up and running, it's said that there wasn't a single survivor. It's not just an hour and forty-five minutes of death and torture, even though it is close. The movie follows a large cast, whether they show the Generals and troops talking about how important this is to Japan or they show the victims and how they need to tell the world what is happening. It's an incredibly strong look at some of the darkest days this world has ever seen. Many a country have committed awful acts, and I suppose this is Japan's. Even though I hear Japan hasn't officially said it took place.\n\nLike I said before, Men Behind the Sun is a strong, powerful and graphic film filled with visuals the average film-goer would rather not see. Truthfully, there's a couple scenes I'd rather have not have seen. There's another comment on here that says \"One Viewing Is Enough\" and I can't agree more. The only people I would recommend this movie to are history/movie/gore buffs. 8.5 outta 10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5815007/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jianxin Chen"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5815004/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Linjie Hao"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2504880/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tie Long Jin"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5815008/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bolin Li"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5815001/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Xuhui Liu"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2503874/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Zhe Quan"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910896/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gang Wang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0093170/characters/nm0910896?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lt.

It's one of those live-actions films produced by Disney's studios.\n\nThe movie's title refers to Wayne Szalinski, a stereotypical nutty/mad scientist. He invents a machine with the ability of shrinking objects to a size even smaller than ants. This character is portrayed by Rick Moranis, the perfect actor for a role like this (with his intellectual looks).\n\nRick Moranis is funny as Wayne Szalinski, Matt Frewer is hilarious as the impatient and temperamental \"Big\" Russell Thompson. The kids also do a good job: Thomas Wilson Brown as the clever \"Little\" Russell Thompson, Jared Rushton as the paranoid Ron Thompson and Robert Oliveri as the nerd Nick Szalinski. One of the funniest parts for me is when \"little\" Russell forces his brother Ron to confess that he broke Szalinski's window with his baseball.\n\nThe Szalinski kids (Nick and Amy) and the Thompson kids (\"Little\" Russell and Ron, the Szalinski's neighbors) are accidentally shrunk by the machine and thrown into the garbage by accident. Because they are so tiny, they live a big adventure full of dangers and nightmares (from insects to a remote-controlled lawn mower) until reaching their house, something which would only take seconds on their normal size.\n\nThe story becomes a bit odd and of a somehow discussable taste, but it also makes the difference... for good and for bad. However, I must be fair: at least this is a thousand times better than those stupid \"Problem Child\" movies. Not that they have anything in common, but... \n\nOverall, nothing extraordinary, but amusing, hilarious, great fun, entertaining, original, bizarre and with some funny lines (\u00abFrench class\u00bb is just one among many others). There's also a certain 80's charm on it.\n\nThe success of this movie inspired a very imaginative 3D film created as an amusement for Disneyland parks around the world called \"Honey, I Shrunk the Audience\".", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001548/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rick Moranis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0001548?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Wayne Szalinski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0833519/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marcia Strassman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0833519?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Diane Szalinski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0114787/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Thomas Wilson Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0114787?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Little Russ Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0642091/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Amy O'Neill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0642091?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Amy Szalinski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0828186/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Carl Steven"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0828186?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tommy Pervis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0731927/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kimmy Robertson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0731927?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gloria Forrester"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0913941/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Laura Waterbury"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0913941?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Female Cop"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0043857/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Martin Aylett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0043857?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Harold Boorstein"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001242/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matt Frewer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0001242?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Big Russ Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0840133/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kristine Sutherland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0840133?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mae Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0750758/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jared Rushton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0750758?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ron Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0647084/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Robert Oliveri"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097523/characters/nm0647084?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nick Szalinski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0852848/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mark L.

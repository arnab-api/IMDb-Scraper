Since both movies talk about love relationship between two women, I was afraid I was going to see the same thing. Gladly, I couldn't be more wrong. Carol is such a beautiful movie, subtler than I had expected.\n\nEven though I loved the movie, I'm aware that it's not for everybody. It's not fast paced, as current films tend to be. It takes its time to carefully construct the characters and to make us root for them. Credit is due to the cast, as Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant, and to the director Todd Haynes, who conducts well the story.\n\nMoreover, the film is visually stunning, with impeccable make-ups and wardrobes, not to mention the beautiful locations covered in snow while they take a road-trip. Finally, the soundtrack is equally wonderful, with songs that correctly set the tone of their relationship.\n\nIt probably won't be a box office hit, but I do hope everybody gets a chance to see it eventually.\n\nFull review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-f6", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1425846809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzODkwMTQ3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE4OTIzNzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzODkwMTQ3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE4OTIzNzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's seminal novel The Price of Salt, 'Carol' follows two women from very different backgrounds who find themselves in an unexpected love affair in 1950s New York. As conventional norms of the time challenge their undeniable attraction, an honest story emerges to reveal the resilience of the heart in the face of change. A young woman in her 20s, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), is a clerk working in a Manhattan department store and dreaming of a more fulfilling life when she meets Carol (Cate Blanchett), an alluring woman trapped in a loveless, convenient marriage. As an immediate connection sparks between them, the innocence of their first encounter dims and their connection deepens. While Carol breaks free from the confines of marriage, her husband (Kyle Chandler) begins to question her competence as a mother as her involvement with Therese and close relationship with her best friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) come to light.", "uploadDate": "2015-11-24T13:16:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000949/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cate Blanchett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm0000949?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carol Aird"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0151419/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kyle Chandler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm0151419?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Harge Aird"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3821405/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jake Lacy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm3821405?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richard Semco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5754425/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cory Michael Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm5754425?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tommy Tucker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6412766/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nik Pajic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm6412766?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Phil McElroy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6394509/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Trent Rowland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm6394509?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jack Taft"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7441180/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kk Heim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm7441180?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rindy Aird"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0359798/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Haney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm0359798?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "John Aird"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1913734/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rooney Mara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm1913734?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Therese Belivet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005299/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sarah Paulson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm0005299?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abby Gerhard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1910274/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Magaro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm1910274?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dannie McElroy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0189755/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kevin Crowley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm0189755?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Fred Haymes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1247855/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Carrie Brownstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm1247855?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Genevieve Cantrell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7456838/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sadie Heim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm7456838?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rindy Aird"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1019450/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Amy Warner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2402927/characters/nm1019450?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jennifer Aird"}]}]}

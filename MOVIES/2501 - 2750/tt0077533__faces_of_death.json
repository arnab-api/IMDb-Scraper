You're staring into the faces of the condemned.  You're witnessing the last moments that others will ever spend on this planet.  You're seeing the horror, terror, and insane fear that strikes without warning as you are about to die.\n\nYet, after watching, there is a strange feeling.  I walked around for two days unable to erase the images from my mind.  I saw this film by accident (my brother and a friend were watching it, I walked in thinking it was \"Children of the Corn\" and somehow stayed glued to the couch until the last credits rolled).\n\nI never felt nauseous.  The only emotion I had was one that I had never TRULY felt before...empathy.  I felt sickened for the families of the people who I was watching.  I felt like crying because there was nothing I could do.  It was just a movie.  What I was watching had been done years before. For those people whose faces appeared on the screen, peace had finally come. But me...I would never be the same again.\n\nI saw that movie about ten years ago.  To this day, I still see some of the scenes in my mind, particularly when I hear the evening news or see a car accident.  For anyone considering renting it, you will be forever changed after watching.  It is really quite unlike anything you will ever see."}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0139801/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Carr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0077533/characters/nm0139801?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Francis B.

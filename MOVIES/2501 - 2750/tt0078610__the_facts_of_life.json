It's dramatic and funny simaltaneously. The Facts of Life focuses on serious issues that teens have to face and it also has a humorous twist. \n\nMrs. Garret, who is played by the very talented Charlotte Rae, is a housekeeper turned housemother turned dietician. She watches out for four girls, Blair (Lisa Whelchel), Jo (Nancy McKeon), Tootie (Kim Fields) and Natalie (Mindy Cohn). She plays the peacemaker and always tries to resolve problems that the girls are dealing with. She calls them \"her girls\" and is always there for them when they need her.\n\nThe episodes with Mrs. Garret are the best. However, the ones later on into the show where she is gone and her sister Beverly Ann is around are horrible. And the cast additions that took place in the last two years of the show, Makenzie Astin as Andy and Sherry Krenn as Pippa, totally ruined The Facts of Life.\n\nI suggest that you watch the episodes that are from the first several years of this show because they feature an excellent cast. But don't watch the last two years of this show because the new cast was horrible, with the exception of the four original girls that remained on The Facts of Life from the very beginning."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Facts of Life", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4155162393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNDRmZjItNDk5My00MGEzLTk0OTYtNzhiNDQzZGNjMjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzNDRmZjItNDk5My00MGEzLTk0OTYtNzhiNDQzZGNjMjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2019-09-11T17:10:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0924075/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lisa Whelchel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078610/characters/nm0924075?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Blair Warner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "201 episodes, 1979-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0169934/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mindy Cohn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078610/characters/nm0169934?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Natalie Green"}, {"url": "#", "name": "201 episodes, 1979-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0705989/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charlotte Rae"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078610/characters/nm0705989?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Edna Garrett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "155 episodes, 1979-1986"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004917/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kim Fields"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078610/characters/nm0004917?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dorothy 'Tootie' Ramsey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "201 episodes, 1979-1988"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001529/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nancy McKeon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0078610/characters/nm0001529?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jo Polniaczek"}, {"url": "#", "name": "188 episodes, 1980-1988"}]}]}

It's the archetypal story of the American West, with its strong, ethical male leader, Thomas Dunson (John Wayne), and his pursuit of a big dream, set in an era when men were men, times were tough, hardships were inevitable, guns ruled, and Native Americans were the bad guys. What a saga ...\n\nWhat makes \"Red River\" such a grand adventure is its high quality. Its story is simple, direct, exciting, and well told, with complex characters, interesting and sympathetic because they show weakness as well as strength. Dunson is a good man, but he's stubborn and headstrong. His semi-adopted son, Matt (Montgomery Clift), is good with a gun but a little softhearted. Dunson's chief sidekick is Groot (Walter Brennan), a cantankerous old buzzard who has problems with his teeth.\n\nIt's the relationship between these three men that is the heart and soul of \"Red River\". Trouble ensues along the way, you can be sure. And how that trouble unfolds and plays out presents viewers with engaging human drama, and humor, centered on these three main characters. The lonesome High Plains, with all its inherent risks, adds grandeur to the epic story.\n\nAt strategic points in the film, the page of a book appears on screen with text that briefly summarizes upcoming events. It's like we, the viewers, are reading a book about some long ago trailblazers. It's a technique that could have been intrusive. But here, it is handled with such finesse that it actually helps the narrative, by functioning as a transition from one sequence to the next.\n\nThe acting is fine. John Wayne is more than convincing as Dunson. Walter Brennan is characteristically funny. And Montgomery Clift is terrific. Had he maintained his looks, and if real-life circumstances not intervened, Monty could have been one of the truly top actors through at least the 50s and 60s.\n\nIf the film has a weakness, it might be the cinematography. Not often, but at times, the actors appear to be standing in front of a canvas, an effect that renders a shallow depth of field. Maybe this was the result of technical limitations of photography at the time the film was made.\n\nThere are few film westerns that can compare in quality with \"Red River\". And I don't know of any other cinematic cattle drives that are this good. So, the next time you herd your cattle to market, this is the film to watch. Even if you have no cattle, \"Red River\" is still a wonderfully entertaining cinematic experience.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H13M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Montgomery Clift Criterion Channel Teaser", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4040540441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZmYmU1NDMtMTNhZi00OWMyLThjNjgtODA1MDgwZWUxZWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTZmYmU1NDMtMTNhZi00OWMyLThjNjgtODA1MDgwZWUxZWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-11-04T09:36:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000078/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Wayne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0000078?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Thomas Dunson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0238445/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joanne Dru"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0238445?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tess Millay"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0336531/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Coleen Gray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0336531?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Fen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0409869/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Ireland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0409869?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cherry Valance"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001013/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harry Carey Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0001013?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dan Latimer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0280707/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paul Fix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0280707?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Teeler Yacey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0474139/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mickey Kuhn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0474139?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Matt - as a Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0907404/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hal Taliaferro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0907404?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Old Leather"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001050/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Montgomery Clift"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0001050?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matt Garth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000974/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Walter Brennan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0000974?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nadine Groot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002503/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Harry Carey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0002503?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Melville"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000890/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Noah Beery Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0000890?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Buster McGee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0950385/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chief Yowlachie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0950385?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Quo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0941401/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hank Worden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0941401?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Simms Reeves"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0405070/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ray Hyke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0040724/characters/nm0405070?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Walt Jergens"}]}]}

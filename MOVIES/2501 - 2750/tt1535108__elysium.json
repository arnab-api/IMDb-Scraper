And it seems to me that there are a lot of people that hated it. Most have said that the message in the film is what kept it 'likable'. Well, after I watched it, I thought to myself, \"Why?\". Trust me, don't believe any negative reviews about this film. Yes, it's flawed, but the film itself is really good.\n\nMatt Damon was great in this film and he was a very likable hero. But Sharlto Copley, oh boy, he was one heck of a villain. He was so good, every scene he was in was disturbing, in a very, very creepy way. He owned almost every scene he was in and was the stronghold of this film. Jodie Foster as the other antagonist, err, she did her part I guess. Every one did a good job and they really enabled the film to lighten up in most areas.\n\nSo, this film was really good, and I was extremely pleased by it. The film did a nice job for making the audience feel attached to the characters, and I applaud to that. The action sequences were nice, and it didn't over power the film, something Elysium got right and what others sort of didn't. (Man Of Steel's epic final battle, was just TOO LONG!) Also on the scenes where it tones down and becomes emotional, was very well done, and it gives this movie heart. It's fast, epic, emotional and incredible.\n\nNow, although the film is great, I only have one small gripe about Elysium. Now, the film is around about 109 minutes. I know, that when a film feels really good and it begins to near it's end, you don't want it to do that just yet. That's how I felt when I saw District 9, and I felt the same with Elysium. The film didn't feel rushed which was nice, but an extra half an hour would've been great.\n\nIs it a Sci-Fi movie? Yes! Is it an action movie? It gets to it. Is it an epic Sci-Fi action movie? Yes. It is epic! It's definitely a must watch this year. I'm being generous to this film, because of the film's message consisting of poverty, wealth and equality. Watch this film with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "UK Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4196837657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NjAxNjEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5MzQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NjAxNjEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5MzQyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Set in the year 2154, where the very wealthy live on a man-made space station while the rest of the population resides on a ruined Earth, a man takes on a mission that could bring equality to the polarized worlds.", "uploadDate": "2013-08-15T07:08:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000354/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Matt Damon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0000354?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Max"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1663205/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sharlto Copley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm1663205?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kruger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0526019/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Diego Luna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0526019?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Julio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001209/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "William Fichtner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0001209?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Carlyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0085664/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Josh Blacker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0085664?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Crowe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1504678/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jose Pablo Cantillo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm1504678?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sandro"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0846687/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Faran Tahir"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0846687?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "President Patel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1742119/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jared Keeso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm1742119?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rico"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000149/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jodie Foster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0000149?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Delacourt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103797/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alice Braga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0103797?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0609944/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Wagner Moura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0609944?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Spider"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1409827/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Brandon Auret"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm1409827?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Drake"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4590173/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Emma Tremblay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm4590173?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Matilda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2265334/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Maxwell Perry Cotton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm2265334?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Young Max"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0391738/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Adrian Holmes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1535108/characters/nm0391738?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Manuel"}]}]}

The emotional depth that that film brought to the table was unparalleled in terms of big blockbusters. I was attached to Caesar and several of the other apes. That movie surprised everyone so it isn't much of a surprise that the sequel 'Dawn' looked even better as they hired Matt Reeves as the replacement director. The special effects are some of the best I have ever seen and the acting was surprisingly outstanding. The trailers looked incredible so my excitement was about as high as it could possibly be for an apes movie. And the film doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe film takes place at least 8 years after 'Rise' and the time jump is much to their benefit. It allowed Caesar to step into his role as leader of all the apes and link between the apes and humans. Speaking of the effects, some of the facial expression the apes gave were just devastating. And for me to say that I was on the verge of tears in a movie where apes can talk should sound absurd but its the truth. Caesar's family is present throughout and his eldest son is the one that hit home. When you see him being put into war unwillingly after life changing events you just cant but help feeling terrible for him. Koba, the corrupt ape who has always believed humans are more dangerous than Caesar thinks is also a conflicting character. There is a scene between him and Caesar near the first act that made me feel sympathy for him and whatever other apes were also tortured. Dreyfuss, played by Gary Oldman also stood out for the short periods that he appears. Much like Koba, he is a man who lost so much that he has lost faith in the world and wants nothing to do with the other species. It's these two characters who keep the conflict rising as peace is on the downfall and war is on the brink. The only real weak part of the film is that the trailers show a lot of the important scenes and I'm a guy who watches trailers everyday. I knew a little bit too much.\n\nTo say that Caesar is one of the greatest leaders in film history is not an overstatement. When he is on screen you cant help but be mesmerized by the immense strength and gravitas that comes along with the character. Now it is time for the academy to honor the greatness that this film brings to all aspects of filmmaking. I wouldn't go as far as saying Serkis deserves a best actor nod, but I wouldn't disagree if they gave it to him. The performance is one for the ages.\n\nThe third act is brilliant in every way a film should be. It was unexpected, visually dazzling, and emotionally fulfilling. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the get go. It's one of the best movies of the summer and definitely made it's mark in motion capture history.\n\n+Caesar's unparalleled leadership \n\n+Special effects and motion capture are just insanely good \n\n+Apes facial expressions can be emotionally devastating \n\n+Koba & Dreyfuss similarly troubled\n\n-I knew a bit too much from trailers \n\n9.2/10\n\nSECOND VIEWING 9.6/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H10M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3448876057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NDY3MzcwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk1OTkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI4NDY3MzcwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk1OTkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the theatrical trailer for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.", "uploadDate": "2014-06-20T15:33:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0785227/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Andy Serkis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0785227?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Caesar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000198/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gary Oldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0000198?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dreyfus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1527905/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Toby Kebbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm1527905?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Koba"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0009716/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kirk Acevedo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0009716?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1024953/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Terry Notary"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm1024953?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rocket"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339460/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Judy Greer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0339460?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cornelia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0006663/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Enrique Murciano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0006663?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kemp"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0743605/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Lee Ross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0743605?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Grey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164809/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jason Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0164809?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Malcolm"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005392/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Keri Russell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0005392?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ellie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2240346/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kodi Smit-McPhee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm2240346?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alexander"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3231354/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nick Thurston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm3231354?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Blue Eyes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0465269/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Karin Konoval"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm0465269?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maurice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1208510/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jon Eyez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm1208510?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Foster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2480883/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Larramie Doc Shaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2103281/characters/nm2480883?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ash"}]}]}

Not normally a huge fan of comedy, I was just about rolling in the theatre aisles during this gem. Robin Williams is brilliant in his 'dual role' as the rejected husband, Daniel, and the buxom British nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nThis movie tells the story of a bitter separation, when Miranda insists on a divorce from her immature, goofy husband. Daniel, denied custody and given only limited visitation, concocts a female nanny character for himself in order to gain daily access to his three children. The kids grow to love and depend on their unusual but very concerned and efficient new nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire, who really gets the household running extremely smoothly. Of course meanwhile Miranda has a new love interest named Stu.\n\nWilliams' portrayal of Mrs. Doubtfire is hilarious in every way, shape, and form. The wig, stockings, dress, make up...it's all too amusing, watching Daniel transform for the part. Wait till you see Mrs. Doubtfire cooking! The most insanely funny scene is at a restaurant where Daniel / Mrs. Doubtfire must quickly be in two places at the same time, so he / she is forced to alternate between personae at lightning speed, sometimes forgetting which one he / she is at any given moment. I won't give away the plot, but I nigh expired from laughing.\n\nSally Field charmingly plays Daniel's now separated wife, Miranda, and Pierce Brosnan is suitably unsympathetic as her new love interest, Stu. We cheer for Daniel through his assorted antics as he tries to shoo away this romantic competitor for his ex wife's affections and especially, this new male threatening to usurp his role as father to his kids.\n\nDesite being a comedy, this film does on the serious side reveal the devastating effects of divorce on children's lives and also particularly on the noncustodial parent. Daniel is distraught as he misses seeing his kids every day. Furthermore, the entrance of a new love interest naturally adds to the general strife.\n\nWhere did Mrs. Doubtfire get her unusual name? Does she live on or fizzle out at movie's end? Will Daniel and Miranda get back together, or will Stu prevail? I won't divulge any spoilers, but I guarantee you'll fall in love with this lovable large nanny and wish you could have her babysit your own kids. Mrs. Doubtfire will certainly live on in your heart.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2747054617", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBkODM0NzEtNDVhNC00MDkwLWE2M2ItNjM3ZTgxNmE3NDBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBkODM0NzEtNDVhNC00MDkwLWE2M2ItNjM3ZTgxNmE3NDBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-09-28T22:57:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000245/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robin Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0000245?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Daniel Hillard"}, {"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0000245?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mrs. Doubtfire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000112/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Pierce Brosnan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0000112?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0391072/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Polly Holliday"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0391072?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gloria"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0492932/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Matthew Lawrence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0492932?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Hillard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0698764/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Robert Prosky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0698764?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Lundy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0135750/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Scott Capurro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0135750?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068725/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Joe Bellan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0068725?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "TV Boss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569598/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Terence McGovern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0569598?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "ADR Director Lou"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000398/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sally Field"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0000398?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Miranda Hillard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001213/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Harvey Fierstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0001213?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frank"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004356/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lisa Jakub"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0004356?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lydia Hillard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0933798/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mara Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0933798?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Natalie Hillard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0359774/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Anne Haney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0359774?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mrs. Sellner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0908246/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sydney Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0908246?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bus Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0611898/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Martin Mull"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107614/characters/nm0611898?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Justin Gregory"}]}]}

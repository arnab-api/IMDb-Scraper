But even less in production and the final release of the picture comes with a similar setting, but only in the genre of horror. The last thing I remember, is quite ambiguous \"Army of Frankenstein\", which is also told about a group of American soldiers in a distant province stumbled upon a secret German laboratory, where he conducted experiments on people. But the film was something of a tough thrash, but the picture of Julius Avery was much more expensive spectacle, and coupled with all of the above components, we got pretty not hackneyed spectacle.\n\nA small detachment of soldiers breaks into the depths of one of the villages of France, which is a Church with a radio tower, which must necessarily be destroyed in order to German anti-aircraft guns could not bring down another allied air transport. The above squad includes the main character of the film - rookie Boyce. Almost all of his newly found comrades were killed during the landing on the territory of France, and he remained with corporal Ford, and a few soldiers-recruits. But ahead of them waiting for things much more terrible than just German soldiers.\n\nThe \"Overlord\" is actually just a great opening scene, which is made damn expensive, large-scale and certainly high quality. This is the scene of course repeatedly demonstrated in various trailers of the picture, but it does not spoil the impressions of it when viewing. Everything explodes, people shoot and tear to pieces, all around panic and real hell, the picture immediately makes it clear that everything is more than serious. But in General, in the future, all the dynamics pretty much subsides, but it does not go into any huge minuses \"Overlord\", as what is happening constantly throws something new for the squad of the main characters. Despite the changing dynamics in a much smaller channel, the film tries to keep some intrigue, and the intrigue sometimes even manage to abide by it. The main problem of \"Overlord\" is the plot, which is needed here as if for show, just to show the extermination of the Nazis and other villains in the setting of the Second world war. At the same time, the picture is filled with some incredible number of stamps and completely banal types of characters. Here you have the rookie main character, which gradually becomes hardened soldier, but you are his commander, the man for whom to obey orders above all else, he loves to joke, and this behaves like an asshole, and of course nowhere without pavada. But about these things you often forget when the film reappears episodes with action, as well as the injection of a certain atmosphere.\n\nI am glad that from the \"Overlord\" in fact expect not so much, that is, you certainly expect a little more scale, similar to a larger action, but in principle, and that there is, in my opinion is enough for positive impressions from the view. Here is also important the fact that something like this comes out very rarely and perhaps this is the only opportunity for the next few, or even more years, to see the bloody action with the Nazis and \"zombies\" in one package. This of course is not so crazy spectacle as some \"Iron sky\", but noticeable pretty thorough approach of the creators, which is still worth praising.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "NOW PLAYING", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2230762009", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU2YmIxOTAtZmExYi00NjA2LTgwYTktMGE1NGUzZDczZDA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU2YmIxOTAtZmExYi00NjA2LTgwYTktMGE1NGUzZDczZDA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-11-08T00:06:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5381254/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jovan Adepo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm5381254?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Boyce"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7230577/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mathilde Ollivier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm7230577?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chloe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1910274/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Magaro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm1910274?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tibbet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2760664/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jacob Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm2760664?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dawson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10227146/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gianny Taufer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm10227146?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940158/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bokeem Woodbine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm0940158?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rensin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7603308/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mark McKenna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm7603308?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Murphy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4704928/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Marc Rissmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm4704928?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Scherzer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0751518/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Wyatt Russell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm0751518?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1561982/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pilou Asb\u00e6k"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm1561982?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wafner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0207691/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Iain De Caestecker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm0207691?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chase"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3038224/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dominic Applewhite"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm3038224?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rosenfeld"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4806449/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joseph Quinn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm4806449?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Grunauer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0715000/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Erich Redman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm0715000?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dr. Schmidt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0138427/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hayley Carmichael"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4530422/characters/nm0138427?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mrs. Lesner"}]}]}

It doesn't happen often. Now I'm not certain when he was first introduced on the show, but I believe it was during the first season. He was the \"wacky neighbor\" with a crush on Laura -- nothing more. Within two seasons, the show was his. He owned it. Huge plot lines revolved around him; he got as much if not more screen time and dialogue as anyone else, and in many cases, more than the entire cast. Some may not like him, but he stole the show out from under the original cast through pure energy and originality. He developed a dead-pan 'look' that rivaled Johnny Carson's and one-upped Mr. Roper's. His physical comedy was outrageous, sometimes slightly ridiculous, but ideally suited to a basic family sitcom. Anyone of-age who has watched some TV in their time knows who Urkel was -- because he was dominant. Like him or not, Urkel is a unique, unforgettable character in TV history, and for that massive achievement, he deserves credit."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Family Matters - TBS Promo (1995)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4119904537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTliZGYwMGItMjg1Mi00YzEwLWExYjktMDMyNTMyYTM1YjcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTliZGYwMGItMjg1Mi00YzEwLWExYjktMDMyNTMyYTM1YjcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-09-25T16:51:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001817/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Reginald VelJohnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0001817?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carl Winslow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "215 episodes, 1989-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0566902/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Darius McCrary"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0566902?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eddie Winslow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "214 episodes, 1989-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0668534/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jo Marie Payton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0668534?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Harriette Winslow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "204 episodes, 1989-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0565971/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bryton James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0565971?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Richie Crawford"}, {"url": "#", "name": "142 episodes, 1990-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0289340/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jaimee Foxworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0289340?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Judy Winslow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "96 episodes, 1989-1995"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931046/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kellie Shanygne Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0931046?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laura Winslow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "215 episodes, 1989-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0924918/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jaleel White"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0924918?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Steve Urkel"}, {"url": "#", "name": "208 episodes, 1989-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0502158/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rosetta LeNoire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0502158?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Estelle 'Mother' Winslow"}, {"url": "#", "name": "159 episodes, 1989-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0365873/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Shawn Harrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0365873?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Waldo Geraldo Faldo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "107 episodes, 1990-1996"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0394286/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Telma Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096579/characters/nm0394286?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rachel Crawford"}, {"url": "#", "name": "94 episodes, 1989-1997"}]}]}

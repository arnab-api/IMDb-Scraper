Should this taint my comment? I don't think so. Say what you will, about myself, or the show, Walker Texas Ranger is one of the greatest shows ever shown on television. I find myself blessed to this very day to have the right, no, the privilege, to watch Carlos Ray Norris Jr. portray possibly one of the most timeless and refreshing characters of our time.\n\nI remember the first time my eyes spotted Walker on the television. The episode had to deal with an evil committee that was supposedly ran by a robot. It turned out that the robot was being controlled by someone else in the room, and Walker eventually delivers multiple roundhouses to that mans face. When I witnessed such TV poetry, I was hooked for good.\n\nDon't watch Walker Texas Ranger if you are at all serious. I would suggest watching with a certain humor in mind. A humor that can see past all of the poorly done plots and acting. Just keep in mind that these people think they have a chance in Hollywood. Which is obviously a pipe dream.\n\nI would just like to say that the whole cast, as a team, paints a mural of what it is like to live in Texas.\n\nwho could possibly pass up the opportunity to hear chuck norris perform the shows theme five minutes into every episode. these are the songs lyrics. feel free to live by them every day of your life.\n\n\"in the eyes of the ranger, the unsuspecting stranger, who better know the truth from wrong or right. when the eyes of the ranger are upon you, everything you do he's going to see. when you're in Texas look behind you, cause thats where the rangers gonna be\" Bless the Hallmark channel and all its glory for keeping such an old horse alive."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi57196057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJkZGViN2EtN2M2Ny00YTVhLWFjNjItYTBkOTBjN2YxZjY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJkZGViN2EtN2M2Ny00YTVhLWFjNjItYTBkOTBjN2YxZjY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Walker and his partner Trivette are Texas Rangers.

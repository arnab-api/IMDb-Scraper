The only one I remembered enjoying was Death Valley Days. So it was with some amusement that when I ordered Wagon Train: The Complete Color Season at Amazon.Com, I was thinking at the time I was ordering the other shows. At 50, my mind was already slipping. When it came, I decided to give it a try. The DVD set includes all 32 episodes of Wagon Trains only color season, plus 16 episodes of the best of the black and white seasons. It turned out to be one of the best television series I have ever bought. What made the color season unique was that the shows were ninety minutes long, each story practically a movie unto themselves. The colors on the transfers were still vivid and the black and white episodes were crisp and clear. Unlike other comments, I really enjoyed John McIntyre in the role of Chris Hale as Wagonmaster. He reminded me almost of John Wayne in his later years, in movies such as True Grit and The Sons Of Katie Elder. The ensemble cast on this show was excellent as well as the endless parade of guest stars, most notably in the color season with Barbara Stanwyck, appearing in two episodes, Suzanne Pleshette, playing a very unsympathetic bad girl role, and Burgess Meredith in a touching, sentimental role that will leave tears in your eyes. Wagon Train was truly one of the great westerns. If you can't find it on TV, I suggest you get it on DVD in whatever form you can find.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Wagon Train: Season 4", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi28097817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0YWEzNTYtYTEyMC00Mzg4LWE3M2UtMDg2YzQ1MzI2Yzc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0YWEzNTYtYTEyMC00Mzg4LWE3M2UtMDg2YzQ1MzI2Yzc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Wagon Train: Season 4", "uploadDate": "2019-03-16T20:12:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569795/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frank McGrath"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050073/characters/nm0569795?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlie Wooster"}, {"url": "#", "name": "271 episodes, 1957-1965"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0395667/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Horton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050073/characters/nm0395667?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Flint McCullough"}, {"url": "#", "name": "189 episodes, 1957-1962"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000955/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ward Bond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050073/characters/nm0000955?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Major Seth Adams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "134 episodes, 1957-1961"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0934211/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Terry Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050073/characters/nm0934211?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bill Hawks"}, {"url": "#", "name": "266 episodes, 1957-1965"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0570615/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John McIntire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0050073/characters/nm0570615?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Christopher Hale"}, {"url": "#", "name": "152 episodes, 1959-1965"}]}]}

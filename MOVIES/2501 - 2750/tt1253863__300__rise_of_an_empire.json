I think this is completely unjustified. This is entertainment and must be treated as such. HIstory aside, there's more than one element of pure fantasy in this movie, so one hardly expects the historical portrayal to be completely factual.\n\nThe storyline is average, the visual effects and action sequences are without doubt state-of-the-art. I generally hate never ending, mindless action sequences but the ones in this flick were quite watchable, there were even a few brilliant moments. \n\nThe best part of the movie for me were the characters, I find the Persians far more interesting - Xerses and Artemisia (Eva Green) are both fascinating. And my biggest gripe with this film is that these fascinating personalities didn't really have much to do. Sadly, the 300 franchise thrives mostly on action sequences and plot lines stay on the back-burner, I think that's where the opportunity of making brilliant sequel was lost and the viewer was left with a decent but forgettable action flick. \n\nIt'd be remiss of me not to give the gorgeous Eva Green a standalone mention, she looks amazing throughout and more than badass to fit her part. Her presence alone was worth the price of admission.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2982128409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Greek general Themistokles attempts to unite all of Greece by leading the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia vengeful commander of the Persian navy.", "uploadDate": "2014-01-21T11:25:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822982/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sullivan Stapleton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0822982?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Themistokles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372176/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lena Headey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0372176?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Queen Gorgo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0612534/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Callan Mulvey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0612534?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Scyllias"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0763928/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rodrigo Santoro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0763928?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Xerxes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0862907/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Andrew Tiernan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0862907?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ephialtes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0687091/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Andrew Pleavin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0687091?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Daxos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1883181/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ben Turner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm1883181?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "General Artaphernes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2544665/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Christopher Sciueref"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm2544665?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "General Kashani"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1200692/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Eva Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm1200692?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Artemisia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0558548/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hans Matheson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0558548?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aeskylos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0920992/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Wenham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0920992?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dilios"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1925239/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jack O'Connell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm1925239?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Calisto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0620981/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Igal Naor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0620981?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "King Darius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0579795/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Peter Mensah"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm0579795?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Persian Emissary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1678557/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ashraf Barhom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1253863/characters/nm1678557?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "General Bandari"}]}]}

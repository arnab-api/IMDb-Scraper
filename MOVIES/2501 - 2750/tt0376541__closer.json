What I'm trying to say in a rather convoluted way is, simply, thank you Mr. Nichols. Adult themes, conceived and performed by adult artists. I hope it makes zillions of dollars so we can have more of it. Jude Law is a Peter O'Toole without the steroids, Julia Roberts a Jeanne Moreau with an American passport, Clive Owen is a child of John Garfield and Peter Finch and Natalie Portman a Jean Peters with a college degree. I saw the film twice in a row, I hadn't done that in years. Not since \"Drugstore Cowboy\", \"Apartment Zero\" and \"Sex Lies and Videotape\" The unfolding of the dark happens in front of our eyes and it feels chillingly familiar. Lies we tell each other with so much conviction with so much honesty. The only real thing is the pain and the loneliness. It doesn't sound like a very entertaining night out but believe me, it is. Go, see for yourself. You may have to confront something you didn't want to confront. That's part of the process call growing up. Who's afraid of that?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Closer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2308413465", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyYmFjNGUtZThlZS00NGRkLTk2ZDgtYzAxMDZiODNlMTA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyYmFjNGUtZThlZS00NGRkLTk2ZDgtYzAxMDZiODNlMTA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Closer", "uploadDate": "2010-12-11T06:09:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000204/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Natalie Portman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0376541/characters/nm0000204?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000210/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julia Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0376541/characters/nm0000210?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0387614/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nick Hobbs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0376541/characters/nm0387614?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Taxi Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000179/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jude Law"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0376541/characters/nm0000179?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0654110/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Clive Owen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0376541/characters/nm0654110?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Larry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0830479/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Colin Stinton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0376541/characters/nm0830479?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Customs Officer"}]}]}

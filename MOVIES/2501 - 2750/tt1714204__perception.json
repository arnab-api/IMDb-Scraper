I was rooting for Eric McCormack to succeed in this role as his successes have been few and far between since Will & Grace ended. You also have Rachael Leigh Cook who has been plummeting since she first starred in the teen hit She's All That. Then finally you have Kelly Rowan who played Kirsten Cohen on The O.C. and hasn't been in much since. All three have been in generational hits and watching Perception leaves you with a feeling of nostalgia. You want them to succeed so you can get a second round of weekly viewing from them.\n\nWell good news. The show is actually very good and definitely worth watching. It will never be loved by the masses but they have created an interesting crime drama that will keep you intrigued. It seems to be based on scientific theory instead of criminal investigation but with a weird twist. You never really know what's real and what's not. It really is all about perception.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Perception", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3967991065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQzMDEwODYtM2VhZi00MDcwLWEwZGItN2ZkYmY3NDU3YzQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQzMDEwODYtM2VhZi00MDcwLWEwZGItN2ZkYmY3NDU3YzQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Perception", "uploadDate": "2019-03-18T00:10:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005202/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eric McCormack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1714204/characters/nm0005202?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Daniel Pierce"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0746414/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kelly Rowan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1714204/characters/nm0746414?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Natalie Vincent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000996/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "LeVar Burton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1714204/characters/nm0000996?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paul Haley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "35 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000337/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rachael Leigh Cook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1714204/characters/nm0000337?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate Moretti"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0807351/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Arjay Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1714204/characters/nm0807351?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Max Lewicki"}, {"url": "#", "name": "39 episodes, 2012-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0937930/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Scott Wolf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1714204/characters/nm0937930?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Donnie Ryan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "27 episodes, 2013-2015"}]}]}

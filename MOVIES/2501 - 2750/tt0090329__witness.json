The story focuses on a detective (Harrison Ford) protecting a young Amish boy who becomes the target of a ruthless killer after he witnesses a brutal murder. Witness is as much about the meeting of cultures as about cops and robbers, this is one of those lucky movies which works out well on all counts and shows that there are still craftsmen lurking in Hollywood. The film is powerful, assured, full of beautiful imagery and devoid of easy moralising, which is good. Ford is Chicago Detective John Book, assigned to investigate a murder that was committed by crooked cop Danny Glover. The only witness is the son of an Amish widow, played by Kelly McGillis. When Book gets too close to the truth, the crooked cops try to kill him, forcing Book to take it on the lamb and hide out in the Amish country. There, he slowly makes a transition into their society, their way of life, and of course, he starts to fall for Kelly McGillis. (who would later star with pretty boy Cruise in \"Top Gun\"). Alexander Godunov, who later played the murderous Karl in \"Die Hard\", makes his debut here as an Amish farmer who is, Ford's romantic rival for Kelly. Also making his debut here is a much younger Viggo Mortensen as another Amish father. Mortensen's barely evident in the role out here,although had his eventual success as Aragorn in \"Lord of the Rings\" ........ After Star Wars & Indiana Jones,Ford succeeded in a serious role and his multi-layered performance earned him his only Oscar Nomination till date.Well directed Romantic Thriller by Peter Weir (Director of Dead poet's Society and Truman Show) that earned him his first Academy Award Nomination. Do watch this one for great Cinematography and Artwork\n\nMy Rating - 8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3546069785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBhZmMzZDUtZDc2YS00MDA0LWI3MDctYjY0ZWUyMjNmZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBhZmMzZDUtZDc2YS00MDA0LWI3MDctYjY0ZWUyMjNmZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-09-14T22:32:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000148/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harrison Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0000148?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Book"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0813977/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josef Sommer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0813977?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Schaeffer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0747962/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jan Rubes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0747962?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eli Lapp"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000418/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Danny Glover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0000418?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "McFee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0526985/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Patti LuPone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0526985?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Elaine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0738189/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Frederick Rolf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0738189?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Stoltzfus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308596/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Garson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0308596?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bishop Tchantz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0189726/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ed Crowley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0189726?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sheriff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000534/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kelly McGillis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0000534?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rachel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001305/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lukas Haas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0001305?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Samuel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324231/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alexander Godunov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0324231?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Daniel Hochleitner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0421116/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Brent Jennings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0421116?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Carter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532815/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Angus MacInnes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0532815?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Fergie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001557/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Viggo Mortensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0001557?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Moses Hochleitner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561876/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Beverly May"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0090329/characters/nm0561876?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mrs. Yoder"}]}]}

Beautifully filmed in terms of light and colors, especially the nature scenes. Everyone plays deeply touching and convincing, but especially Lance Henriksen's acting is in a class of its own and he deserves an Oscar! Pay attention to every detail. They are joyful.\n\nThe first thing the father says to his little newborn son in the entrance scene: \"I am sorry I brought you into this world ... so that you could die\" - and the exit scene of this movie is amazing and liberating in more than one way- WOW! It is ingeniously written, directed and so beautifully filmed by Viggo Mortensen, and this film is his debut, as a director. And what a debut!\n\nThis IS a film about love - also the love that can not be expressed directly and genuinely and therefore becomes degenerated (bestial) and turned into hatred and pure evil. But it is first and foremost a film about a deeply complicated man and the masculine, about the feelings between father and son, father and daughter - and not least between a man and his two wives. But it is also a film about dementia and what this disease does to a human being and its relatives, and then it is a film about the fear of death. I do not know why we in Denmark or Europe have to settle for a differently cut version? The trailer shows several touching scenes, which are not in this one, among the cut scenes scenes are one where the sister weeping embraces her brother with the words: \"Heaven does not want him and hell keeps sending him back!\".", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1936900377", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRiZGM4ZWEtNGNhZi00YTYyLWJmZTYtNjZhMmJjMTI3Y2ZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRiZGM4ZWEtNGNhZi00YTYyLWJmZTYtNjZhMmJjMTI3Y2ZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "John Peterson lives with his partner Eric and their adopted daughter in Southern California.

It's sort of like Big Head on Netflix. If you think about it for too long it does seem a little weird; adults acting as kids. They hired body doubles for any scene remotely crossing the line, though. These girls handled quite a difficult role exceptionally well. It's definitely a touchy subject to make a show about.\n\nI still gave it a chance because the guys from The Lonely Island were heavily involved. It's up to you to make the decision if it crosses your line. I do believe those who think this resembles harmful nature may have deeper set issues, though. Everybody seemed like they had fun making it from the interviews and it's also a solid credential for the kids careers.\n\nSecondly, I'm glad I did give this a chance. Maya and Anna are hilarious and awkward in it. It's pretty funny when Maya yells and throws fits. Anna seems like a genuine person to me. For the role she put herself into, she did extremely well. They both reminded me of people I knew growing up at random points. It's just a show about life in middle school, amped up for humor, but still not too far off.\n\nIt's a pretty funny show with a heartfelt touch. Reminiscent of the old days and some issues we went through in our early teens--male and female wise. They did really well casting the two main characters. Without them, the show seems like it may have fell flat or possibly just been too weird or creepy. I would watch a season 2 because of those two. They need to make more together.\n\nSolid 8/10. Not the funniest or greatest show, but it definitely is a hilariously written, awkward ride. I binged it all in a day and was just expecting to try an episode out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3866017305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjVjYTVmMTMtMWU1Mi00ZjFiLWJkNGItZGFkNzJkMjg4OGRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjVjYTVmMTMtMWU1Mi00ZjFiLWJkNGItZGFkNzJkMjg4OGRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "\"Pen15\" is an R-rated \"traumedy\" set in middle school as it really happened in the year 2000.

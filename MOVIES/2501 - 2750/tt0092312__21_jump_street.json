It certainly had at least one cast member who became a mega star in Johnny Depp. When Depp left the show, it sputtered on for a while, but ultimately died when other regulars left as well.\n\nI might not agree with all of Johnny Depp's opinions, but I certainly have enormous respect for his artistic vision. He was good, he was very good as Officer Tom Hanson in 21 Jump Street, but he left at what turned out the right time for him before he was trapped as a juvenile teen idol forever and created one fantastic body of work as one of the best players around. He knew what he was capable of back in the day and the rest of us know it now too.\n\nI was surprised that Dustin Nguyen didn't break out from 21 Jump Street as well as a big star. He should have had a great career as an oriental leading man, he had the looks, talent and definitely the martial arts skill.\n\nIn a way the Sixties handed off to the Eighties in the person of original captain of the Jump Street program, Frederic Forrest. He was one weird dude as the hippie type captain, a real refugee of the tune in, turn on, drop out generation. The character didn't work, so he was quickly dispatched and Steven Williams came on board as the new captain and a more traditional police authority figure.\n\nYou can see a lot of future stars in 21 Jump Street, Jason Priestley and Brad Pitt did episodes back in the day. I liked the stories very much, the series regulars were as human and as flawed as some of the kids they were dealing with.\n\nI wish it had lasted longer, but maybe if Johnny Depp had stuck with it longer we might never have seen Captain Jack Sparrow.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "21 Jump Street: Season 5", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2463284505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGYxZjM5NjQtYTA3Yy00OWVkLThjZWQtNTlkNGRmY2FkYzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGYxZjM5NjQtYTA3Yy00OWVkLThjZWQtNTlkNGRmY2FkYzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "21 Jump Street: Season 5", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T06:44:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005372/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Holly Robinson Peete"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092312/characters/nm0005372?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Officer Judy Hoffs"}, {"url": "#", "name": "102 episodes, 1987-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0217938/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter DeLuise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092312/characters/nm0217938?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Officer Doug Penhall"}, {"url": "#", "name": "91 episodes, 1987-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0629006/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dustin Nguyen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092312/characters/nm0629006?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Officer Harry Truman Ioki"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 1987-1990"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931736/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Steven Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092312/characters/nm0931736?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Captain Adam Fuller"}, {"url": "#", "name": "97 episodes, 1987-1991"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092312/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Officer Tom Hanson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 1987-1990"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420693/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sal Jenco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0092312/characters/nm0420693?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sal 'Blowfish' Banducci"}, {"url": "#", "name": "41 episodes, 1987-1990"}]}]}

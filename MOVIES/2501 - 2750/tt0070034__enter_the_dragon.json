Aside from dangerously wide lapels and some corny era-related dialogue (most notably delivered by Jim Kelly, the film's only African American). Enter the Dragon still delivers the same powerful punch it did three decades ago.\n\nOf course, back then, it was merely the best martial arts film. Now, however, it is the chief testament to the grace and skill of Bruce Lee, and the only one of his four films that he had any sort of creative control over \u0096 and you can see the difference between this and his Hong Kong films easily.\n\nLee does a Tony Danza and plays Mr. Lee, a shao-lin warrior who is recruited by a foreign government (it's assumed to be the English but is never explicitly stated) to infiltrate the island of a megalomaniac martial artist named Han (Kien Shih) who holds tournaments to find the best martial artists in the world. And because that's not enough motivation, it's also revealed that Han's bodyguard, Oharra (Robert Wall) killed Bruce's sister three years ago. So, like every Lee movie, there is a personal vendetta involved, and like every Lee film, Bruce's character asks forgiveness from his family for the deadly violence he is about to unleash. Along for the ride are gamblaholic Roper (John Saxon) and ghetto survivor Williams (Kelly).\n\nThe plot seems like a contrivance now, but that was before it was copied to death in the last three decades. It's actually a plausible and somewhat clever excuse to show people what they came to see \u0096 Bruce Lee repeatedly kicking butt. From the opening fight scene (against Sammo Hung) through the fabulous finale where Lee single-handedly takes on half the island, the movie is a joy to watch on the physical level. It's the world's greatest martial artist at his peak, in a showcase perfectly designed for him. It was an ideal if unintentional shrine to the man.\n\nLee is not merely content to let us watch him bash people, though; some of his philosophy penetrates the movie, which is probably the real reason why Enter the Dragon has stayed so fresh so long. Lee talks about spirituality with a young charge and even gives us an amusing and illustrative lesson in his 'art of fighting without fighting' \u0096 which is the credo of any real warrior. Lee also shows us the flip side; the show-offs and power-hungry who are only in it for the physical and material advantage. He takes care to show us how debased they are before dispatching them, however.\n\nWhile Saxon and the rest of the cast are perfectly acceptable (Jim Kelly overdoes it a bit, but oddly that fits the film), Lee is terrific in this piece. Bruce Lee was a riveting performer and nowhere is that better demonstrated than in this movie. It's a testament to his legacy that three decades later, no one has come close to his skill, and people are still stealing ideas from him (Kill Bill, etc.). It gives one pause while watching Enter the Dragon to think of just what Bruce Lee could have accomplished had he lived.\n\nI suppose those who don't like martial arts wouldn't care for this film, but I've seen it convert even unbelievers before. Lee is that good, and that charismatic, that you can't help but be drawn to him. Certainly his greatest film is worth checking out again on this spiffy new re- release. Even if you're not the biggest martial arts fan, how often do you get to check out a legend at the top of his game?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Enter the Dragon", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1923416345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlMjc5OTQtNzdmOC00NDRjLTg3ZDEtYmM3ZDc1MzlkMTgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThlMjc5OTQtNzdmOC00NDRjLTg3ZDEtYmM3ZDc1MzlkMTgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Enter The Dragon", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:01:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000045/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070034/characters/nm0000045?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0446485/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jim Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070034/characters/nm0446485?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0793384/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kien Shih"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070034/characters/nm0793384?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Han"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0544547/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Angela Mao"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070034/characters/nm0544547?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Su Lin (Guest star)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0917315/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Geoffrey Weeks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070034/characters/nm0917315?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Braithwaite"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0033717/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peter Archer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070034/characters/nm0033717?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Parsons"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164262/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Marlene Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070034/characters/nm0164262?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Secretary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0445585/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bill Keller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070034/characters/nm0445585?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "L.A.

This is actually really-really good!", "reviewBody": "I was totally surprised and blown away by this movie! First of all, Superman Returns takes you back to the original cinematic universe of Superman 1 and 2. When the movie started and I realized that, I was pretty skeptic, I didn't believe that it could work 26 years after Superman 2 (actually it was 36 years, when I was watching it). Then when Clark Kent returned to the Daily Planet, and I saw that the actor (Brandon Routh) is actually doing Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent, I was like \"Oh no, this will be bad!\". The same thing with the young photographer, Jimmy Olsen - the actor was playing the exact same character. I didn't like the concept. But then I said to myself, okay, I'm gonna go with it, so I kept watching the movie, and very shortly I had to realize that it actually works! It was funny, it was exciting, it was emotional - it was everything that a classical Superman movie needs to be! Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane was amazing! She was actually not trying to copy Margot Kidder, she was doing her own thing, but still remained Lois Lane. I would say, as far as acting goes, Kate Bosworth was the best thing in this movie. \n\nA couple of things I didn't like: \n\n1. In the first half of the movie there were some pretty bad CGI moments. There were some scenes where Superman almost looked cartoonish. Thankfully it was only 2 or 3 scenes, the rest of the visuals and CG were pretty good - especially considering that the movie was made in 2006. \n\n2. Kevin Spacey was not a good Lex Luthor. He probably was told to do Gene Hackman's Lex and it just didn't work. At least in the first half of the movie. In the last hour or so, it seemed like he started to adjust the character to himself a little bit, and that did make him more believable as Luthor.\n\nIn the last half an hour the movie was flying! There was action, there was suspense, drama and a lot of emotion - but not too much! It was just perfect. I was actually in tears, which doesn't happen to me very often.\n\nBy the way, I did like Man Of Steel too, I didn't mind that DC eventually took the franchise in that direction. But I have to say, I did like Superman Returns even more. This one I loved! This is not the kind of superhero movie that fans expect from DC and/or Marvel in 2016. This rather takes you back 20-30 years in time and helps you feel what it was like when as a kid you were cheering for Superman. \n\nThank you, Bryan Singer and whoever else was involved in it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi641508889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNDAzODkzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE2MTU0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNDAzODkzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE2MTU0OQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After a long visit to the lost remains of the planet Krypton, the Man of Steel returns to Earth to become the people's savior once again and reclaim the love of Lois Lane.", "uploadDate": "2013-04-30T21:01:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0746125/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Brandon Routh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0746125?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clark Kent"}, {"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0746125?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Superman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000228/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kevin Spacey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0000228?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lex Luthor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000205/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Parker Posey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0000205?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kitty Kowalski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0403134/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sam Huntington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0403134?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jimmy Olsen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Marlon Brando"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0000008?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jor-El"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2294573/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tristan Lake Leabu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm2294573?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jason White"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1345123/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ian Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm1345123?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Riley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0489001/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jack Larson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0489001?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bo the Bartender"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0098378/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate Bosworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0098378?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lois Lane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005188/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James Marsden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0005188?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Richard White"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001449/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Frank Langella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0001449?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Perry White"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001693/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eva Marie Saint"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0001693?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Martha Kent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0671980/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kal Penn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0671980?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stanford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0264781/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "David Fabrizio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm0264781?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brutus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1651267/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Vincent Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0348150/characters/nm1651267?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Grant"}]}]}

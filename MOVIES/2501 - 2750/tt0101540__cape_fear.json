The multi-tattooed voluminous DeNiro is far less menacing than Robert Mitchum was in the original.\n\nOne thing Scorsese did was change the billing to reflect the importance of the characters. Mitchum was billed second to Gregory Peck, the upright attorney who Mitchum threatened and stalked along with Peck's family. Then again Peck was producing the original Cape Fear so of course he was first billed. \n\nPart of the problem was that with some 20 to 30 minutes additional running time Scorsese used it to make his characters a bit more complex. DeNiro was a real basket case as Max Cady in this one whereas Robert Mitchum was just plain no good.\n\nNick Nolte plays attorney Sam Bowden and he's also far more complex and not such a good guy. In the original film Peck was an attorney, but he was a witness in the trial that convicted Cady of rape. Here he was Cady's attorney and he tanked the case because Cady was such a psycho he deserved to be behind bars. Cady in fact does have a grudge of sorts against him. And it's not good to get a psycho mad at you.\n\nAlso Peck and his whole family which consisted of Polly Bergen and Lori Martin back in the original was your basic all American white bread family. Their very wholesomeness made the scope of Mitchum stalking them all the more frightening.\n\nNolte and Jessica Lange have marital problems and their daughter Juliette Lewis is not Mary Poppins. Not that they deserved what DeNiro was going to do to them, but it does blunt the impact of the scope of his evil.\n\nGregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam from the original cast all played supporting parts here. But while the film that Scorsese did is a good one, their presence made me all the more hunger for the original.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi458210073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzA5MzViYjQtNDhjMi00ZmJiLWE2NWUtMTQ5OGZmNGM1YzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzA5MzViYjQtNDhjMi00ZmJiLWE2NWUtMTQ5OGZmNGM1YzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-09-20T21:49:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000134/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert De Niro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0000134?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Max Cady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001448/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jessica Lange"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0001448?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Leigh Bowden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000833/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Joe Don Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0000833?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Claude Kersek"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000060/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gregory Peck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0000060?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lee Heller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001152/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Illeana Douglas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0001152?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lori Davis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0599493/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Zully Montero"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0599493?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Graciella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0123578/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Forest Burton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0123578?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Prisoner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0050454/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rod Ball"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0050454?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Prisoner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000560/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nick Nolte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0000560?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sam Bowden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000496/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Juliette Lewis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0000496?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Danielle Bowden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000053/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Robert Mitchum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0000053?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lieutenant Elgart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000842/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Martin Balsam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0000842?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Judge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000669/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Fred Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0000669?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tom Broadbent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0377177/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Craig Henne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0377177?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Prisoner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0688092/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Edgar Allan Poe IV"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0101540/characters/nm0688092?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Prisoner"}]}]}

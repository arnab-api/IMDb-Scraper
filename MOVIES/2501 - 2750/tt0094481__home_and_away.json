You have to appreciate the history to enjoy the show. The show has a lot of history and helps budding young actors get started. Kate Richie is one of the best actors, probably because she was there from the start and we (the viewers) were able to see her grow up. The show is obviously a little exaggerated I mean our ordinary life is not as adventurous but I think that's what makes us (the viewers) watch it. Thanks for a teriffic show, I will always watch it."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Seven 2020 Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi75677977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWZiODE2YmQtMTg1NS00MzJiLTk4ZTAtNzc5YTY3ZmI2ZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWZiODE2YmQtMTg1NS00MzJiLTk4ZTAtNzc5YTY3ZmI2ZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-10-05T11:04:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0575114/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ray Meagher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094481/characters/nm0575114?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alf Stewart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "4,199 episodes, 1988-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0843381/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Emily Symons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094481/characters/nm0843381?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marilyn Chambers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,031 episodes, 1989-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569758/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lynne McGranger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094481/characters/nm0569758?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Irene Roberts"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2,455 episodes, 1993-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0630124/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ada Nicodemou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0094481/characters/nm0630124?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Leah Patterson-Baker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1,906 episodes, 2000-2021"}]}]}

Doing away with the story building of the first one, Blade II captured a nice balance between plot and action and it was an entertaining ride throughout. For this third instalment, however that perfect balance has been interrupted, and calling this film 'action heavy' would be an understatement. While the action in the movie is well done and entertaining to watch, when you've seen 45th bad guy being smashed through a window, it loses it's impact somewhat. The talking scenes in between the action are either small plot details that the film needs to string itself together, or just another action sequence set-up. The plot is messy to say the least, and there's far too much going on for it to be streamlined into an engaging and satisfying story, but nevertheless it follows the vampires as they resurrect legendary bloodsucker Dracula and get Blade into trouble with the cops. However, Blade manages to team up with a ragtag bunch of vampire hunters and together they attempt to thwart Dracula and the rest of the vampires! Oh, and the cops.\n\nDavid S. Goyer, the man who wrote the first two Blade films has taken the director's chair this time round. He's obviously being watching too much Mtv too, as he seems far too keen to not allow the audience to know what is going on. The quick style Mtv editing is abundant, and it quickly becomes apparent that you will end up very dizzy by the end of the film. The director/writer has dragged together an eclectic cast to compliment Wesley Snipes, which includes the sizzling Jessica Biel, along with two more experienced actresses who should know better; Parker Posey and Natasha Lyonne, and Kris Kristofferson returns also; and WWF wrestler Triple H joins in the fun too. Wesley Snipes has made his name playing the human/vampire hybrid in this comic strip movie series, and with this performance he seems like an actor bored with his work. Whether or not that's because of the extremely thin caricature that Snipes has been given to work with this time round, or maybe it's because he's fed up of 'more of the same'. Anyway, Blade Trinity is quality entertainment. What it lacks in depth, it makes up for in coolness and action and if you liked the first two, you might as well see this one as well.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Blade: Trinity", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3753509145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdlMDk4ZDUtYmFkMi00N2RmLTljOWQtOTk2OGI3OTA5ZjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdlMDk4ZDUtYmFkMi00N2RmLTljOWQtOTk2OGI3OTA5ZjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from New Line Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:38:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000648/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Wesley Snipes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0000648?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Blade"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0700712/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dominic Purcell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0700712?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Drake"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005351/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ryan Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hannibal King"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0077623/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mark Berry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0077623?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chief Martin Vreede"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719678/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Callum Keith Rennie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0719678?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Asher Talos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1457826/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paul Anthony"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm1457826?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Wolfe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0712649/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michael Anthony Rawlins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0712649?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Wilson Hale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005169/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Natasha Lyonne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0005169?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sommerfield"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001434/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kris Kristofferson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0001434?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Whistler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004754/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jessica Biel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0004754?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abigail Whistler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000205/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Parker Posey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0000205?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Danica Talos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383422/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "John Michael Higgins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0383422?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Edgar Vance"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0505391/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Paul Levesque"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0505391?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jarko Grimwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0948123/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Fran\u00e7oise Yip"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0948123?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Virago"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001664/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "James Remar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0359013/characters/nm0001664?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ray Cumberland"}]}]}

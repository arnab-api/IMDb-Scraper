Most are pretty stupid, especially when you get to see what a bunch of weenie-arms most actors are (OK, Charlie Sheen, Costner and Kurt Russell actually know how to play...) I did read all 170 of the comments about this movie, because I was intrigued to read what people who are undoubtedly from all persuasions think of it (even many from other countries). One thing that amazed me was the number of baseball fans who recommended Bull Durham, which I found just average and Major League, which was slapstick at its worst. Anyhow, I digress...\n\nI've read a lot of user comments on this site and usually there is a widely divergent range of opinions. Not with this film, though. My rough estimate was about 160 \"excellent/changed my life\" to about 10 \"overrated/corny/historically incorrect\". That's a pretty amazing record. \n\nThat all being said, and I apologize if this has been a little long-winded, but this is a wonderful movie. I can relate especially now as I am about to move my family to New Hampshire (with few prospects) just because it will be a little closer to the ideal America I am looking for. I'd like to think this movie helped give me the courage.) Yes, this is about the only time Costner is perfectly cast. It seems he is playing himself. The others are excellent, as well. \n\nI think this movie needs some revisionist historians to take another look. The conventional wisdom seems to be a 3 to 3.5 star film. No way, I say. It's much too magical to be anything other than 4 stars. The \"It's a Wonderful Life\" comparisons are apt. Perhaps it should be put in a time capsule. Another thing I thought was particularly interesting is that how many people who either don't like or understand baseball (their loss) seem to love this movie. They even go so far as to say \"it's not even about baseball.\" What a great compliment, indeed, for a movie- that so many people get so much out of, for so many different reasons. Of course, if you do love baseball for the sheer beauty and grace of it, along with the undeniable impact/fabric it has had on America, then this movie does border on the religious experience (which many have alluded to). \n\nAll in all, I have greatly enjoyed all of your comments, (especially those from our UK, Aussie, and Kiwi friends), and the reason I have stopped watching Field of Dreams (in reference to my summary's title), is because I'm tired of how my wife laughs at me for always crying in the end...and by the way, I get along just fine with my Dad!!"}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Field of Dreams", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi459472921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJhZGVjNWYtMTdlMS00YjkzLTk5YTItOGJiMDY4MTNkMTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTJhZGVjNWYtMTdlMS00YjkzLTk5YTItOGJiMDY4MTNkMTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Universal Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-10-18T03:17:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000126/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Costner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0000126?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ray Kinsella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000451/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gaby Hoffmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0000451?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Karin Kinsella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124079/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Timothy Busfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0124079?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mark"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000044/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Burt Lancaster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0000044?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dr. Archibald 'Moonlight' Graham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0113474/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dwier Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0113474?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John Kinsella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0443813/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mary Anne Kean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0443813?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Feed Store Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0168907/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kelly Coffield Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0168907?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dee, Mark's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0247611/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Steve Eastin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0247611?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Eddie Cicotte - P"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001496/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Amy Madigan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0001496?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Annie Kinsella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000501/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ray Liotta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0000501?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shoeless Joe Jackson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000469/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "James Earl Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0000469?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Terence Mann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001844/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Frank Whaley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0001844?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Archie Graham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0025908/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "James Andelin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0025908?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Feed Store Farmer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0675535/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Fern Persons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0675535?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Annie's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0587379/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Michael Milhoan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097351/characters/nm0587379?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Buck Weaver - 3B"}]}]}

Dalits are blacks of India. The experience of Dalits and Black lives are very similar. Only difference is America has a moral conscience and constantly tries to correct the wrongdoings of history while India is in denial about its wrongdoings and actively suppresses people from unprivileged background.\n\nHere are the experiences of Starr Carter which most of our people find completely relatable 1. The Black Panther movement her father is part of, we have a similar movement. 2. The constantly switching of personality between her own people and white people. Hiding your true self to get accepted. 3. Constantly hearing sly racist comments and yet not able to do anything about it but stay silent while you mind is angry as hell. 4. The character Hailey who pretends to not be racist is constantly making racist remarks and is a racist. I had friends like those, after watching this movie i have decided to not be friends like this people anymore. I have unfriended them on social media and have deleted their numbers. 5. The portrayal in media as stupid and taking the worst elements of the group to portray the entire community as wrong. 6. Police brutality and denial of justice. 7. Black people suppressing other black people.\n\nThere are so many moments in the movie where i had tears in my eyes and i could see my people going through the same thing. I was emotional throughout the movie. The articulation of frustration of oppressed people is so real and raw.\n\nMost people who are giving this movie bad reviews are looking it from technical perspective and dont have the lived experience of the people. They dont have the experience of daily frustration of living a life where your community is subjected to discrimination, mockery, injustice everyday and you have to live among same people who do this. Movies like these would never get made here. Thank you very much for making such movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H13M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2382150425", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M2YTFkNDQtYjI0ZS00ZDNkLTg0ZGQtMGY0Yjg5YjRmNDcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M2YTFkNDQtYjI0ZS00ZDNkLTg0ZGQtMGY0Yjg5YjRmNDcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg", "description": "Starr Carter is constantly switching between two worlds: the poor, mostly black, neighborhood where she lives and the rich, mostly white, prep school she attends.

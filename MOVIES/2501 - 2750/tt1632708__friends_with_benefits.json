The main problem to me is that when it starts, the film is being played as satire and when it ends, it's being played straight. As a result, Friends with Benefits does not quite rise above the romantic material it mocks, but on occasion it's funny and adorable.\n\nActually for a while, the movie is on fire. The opening is cleverly handled, and is a good way to grab the audiences attention. Then for the next several scenes, Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake demonstrate charm, comfort and overall competence and end up delivering a couple of the funniest sexual encounters I've seen in years. What I like about them both is that they bring enthusiasm to whatever they do, and this film is no exception.\n\nAround the halfway point, the film starts to feel a little boring. with a running time of just over a hundred minutes, Friends with Benefits is not a long movie, and while it's not exactly short either, it feels shorter than it should be. There are a few hints to suggest that a longer movie was intended but the Studio may have forced a cut down. In addition to an ending that feels rushed, all the supporting characters in the story seem futile, and underwritten. Woody Harrelsson, for example, can be a really funny guy, but he's not given the material or the screen time, to make his appearance worthwhile.\n\nThe film has it's ups, it has it's downs. It doesn't end up being a bad Rom-com, but I've seen better.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2190056729", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMzE4OTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3NzY3NA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMzE4OTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3NzY3NA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The relationship between two friends (Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis) gets complicated when they decide to get romantic.", "uploadDate": "2011-03-22T15:02:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005493/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Justin Timberlake"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm0005493?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dylan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0165101/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Patricia Clarkson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm0165101?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lorna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1034965/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bryan Greenberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm1034965?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1676221/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Andy Samberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm1676221?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Quincy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0281598/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Andrew Fleming"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm0281598?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1136435/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Courtney Henggeler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm1136435?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Flight Attendant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1587188/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tiya Sircar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm1587188?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hostess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005109/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mila Kunis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm0005109?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jamie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001184/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jenna Elfman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm0001184?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Annie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420955/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Richard Jenkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm0420955?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Harper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2188098/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nolan Gould"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm2188098?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1027039/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Shaun White"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm1027039?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Self"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0718642/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Catherine Reitman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm0718642?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Female Co-Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1199811/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Masi Oka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1632708/characters/nm1199811?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Darin Arturo Morena"}]}]}

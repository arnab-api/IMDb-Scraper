I have always loved ghost stories, and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever. It's like one of the great old black and white ghost stories but better. It takes you on a slow, and uncomfortable ride.\n\nThe story is simple. Grace lives in a mansion with her two children, both allergic to sunlight. That little twist on the story was just great. It makes the film completely opposite than other ghost stories, with Grace not afraid of the dark, and making sure to keep the light out, to save her children. This provides us with a very creepy, and dark atmosphere. Plus the mansion is also a creepy place. Not to mention, that in the film everyone who enters the house, must close the previous door, before opening the next.\n\n Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast in The Others. This may be one of her best performances ever (She was also great in this years Moulin Rouge). She was really very believable in the part. The two kids in this film were also fantastic. Alakina Mann as Anne was terrific. She played the bullying sister great. She and James Bently, who played Nicolas, really seemed like siblings. Awesome job by both. Fionnula Flanagan was also fantastic as Mrs. Mills. She really creeped me out, and I didn't know where she stood. Was she good or bad? I didn't know, but her acting was right on the ball.\n\nAlejandro Anemabar directed The Others with such atmosphere. The dark lighting is creepy, and the cinematography is beautiful. This guy's has got a bright future. To accompany all the atmosphere we get a fabulous score by the director, Alejandro Amenabar. The music is creepy, and really adds to the feel of a 50's ghost story. It also sets the mood of the film, and makes the scary scenes, even scarier. The score is fabulous. Not only did Alejandro Amenabar direct, and score, but he wrote the great, and well-developed screenplay.\n\nThe Others is not without a great twist ending, that should shock everyone. I did not see it coming, and it's such an original concept to use in a ghost story. It worked well, and I was speechless after the film. Outstanding finale.\n\nThis film is yet another horror film that proves that big budget special effects suck! This film is scary, and it only had a $17m budget. The Others did great at the box office, and deserved every buck it earned. It's a creepy film, that has its very scary moments. This is a film that will not be forgotten. It'll be stuck in my mind for a long time. This really reminded me of an old 40's or 50's film. I highly recommend this film to every fan of ghost stories.\n\nThe Others: 10/10, A+", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Others", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3201343001", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdmYzRkOWMtNWUyYS00ZDU0LThiZjItZThkMGVkZjNiMDljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdmYzRkOWMtNWUyYS00ZDU0LThiZjItZThkMGVkZjNiMDljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:55:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000173/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nicole Kidman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0000173?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Grace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001172/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christopher Eccleston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0001172?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0972848/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "James Bentley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0972848?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nicholas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0144187/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Elaine Cassidy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0144187?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lydia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0717276/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gordon Reid"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0717276?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Assistant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0265610/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Michelle Fairley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0265610?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Marlish"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0530341/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ricardo L\u00f3pez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0530341?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "2nd Assistant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001217/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Fionnula Flanagan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0001217?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mrs. Mills"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0542635/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alakina Mann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0542635?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0843059/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Eric Sykes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0843059?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Tuttle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0038914/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ren\u00e9e Asherson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0038914?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Old Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0020717/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Keith Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0020717?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mr. Marlish"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1019987/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Alexander Vince"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm1019987?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Victor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342067/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Aldo Grilo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0230600/characters/nm0342067?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Gardener"}]}]}

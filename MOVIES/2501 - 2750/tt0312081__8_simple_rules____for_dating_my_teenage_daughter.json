There was a lot of speculation about merely replacing the star with another actor. The people at the show chose instead to go out on a limb and let the show mirror reality. They showed the pain of a family goes through when losing a loved one. \"8 Simple Rules\" is showing the family adapting to the hole that has been torn in their lives that can never be filled. They are showing the truth. And showing that there still is humor in life. Most sit-coms now-a-days shy too much away from reality and give us a syrupy-sweet, trite twenty minutes of simulated laugh tracks and simulated humor. The writers go for the easy sells and go cash their sponsor checks. \"8 Simple Rules\" has gone beyond such shallow ends to bring us a show we can all appreciate. Thank you, ABC."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3222912537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmY0MjRkZmQtYzdmMi00MDFhLWI2NzUtZDMxYzA2NmE2NDZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmY0MjRkZmQtYzdmMi00MDFhLWI2NzUtZDMxYzA2NmE2NDZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Hennessy clan -- mother Cate, daughters Bridget and Kerry, and son Rory -- look to one another for guidance and support after the death of Paul, the family patriarch.

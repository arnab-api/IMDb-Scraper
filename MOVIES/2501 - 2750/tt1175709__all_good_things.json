Who among us isn't intrigued by a real life \"unsolved\" murder mystery? Throw in a very wealthy New York real estate family, a never-discovered body, an executed friend, and a horrible childhood trauma and it is certain to draw the attention of filmmaker Andrew Jarecki. Jarecki's film \"Capturing the Friedmans\" won numerous awards and is among the best documentaries ever made. He has a knack with dark family secrets.\n\nIn the film, Ryan Gosling plays David Marks, disenchanted son of Real Estate mogul Sanford Marks (a powerful Frank Langella), who witnessed the grisly suicide of his mother when he was very young. David meets the energetic and affectionate Katie (Kirsten Dunst) and the two dreamers escape Daddy's clutches and head to Vermont to open a health food store. Finally wilting under pressure from Sanford, the couple returns to the city and David joins the family business. The good things are soon to end.\n\nSince much of the real life story is still a mystery, Jarecki does a nice job in assembling pieces from the trial records. Along the way, we meet David's friend Deborah Lehrman (Lilly Rabe), an acclaimed writer who seems to always be there for David ... as he is for her. We witness the transformation of David from loving husband to mentally disturbed murder suspect.\n\nJarecki gives us some guidance on what might have happened and how the plan could have been executed, but we'll never know for sure. What we do know is that there was not much happiness associated with this family, despite the wealth and 42nd Street real estate holdings.\n\nThe acting in the film is tremendous. Gosling, Dunst and Langella are top notch. Yes, Ms. Dunst provides what is easily her best screen performance ever. Support work from Lily Rabe, Phillip Baker Hall, Nick Offerman and Kristen Wiig is all strong and believable. This one will give you the creeps ... and rightly so.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "All Good Things", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4062157081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg2NDAwNTYwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk3ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg2NDAwNTYwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk3ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A detective (Morgan) begins to unravel a missing-persons case that might spell doom for the heir to a New York real estate dynasty (Gosling), who fell for a young woman from the wrong side of the tracks (Dunst).", "uploadDate": "2010-10-21T06:36:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331516/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Gosling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0331516?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Marks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001449/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Frank Langella"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0001449?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sanford Marks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001311/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Philip Baker Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0001311?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Malvern Bump"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0893204/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Diane Venora"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0893204?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Janice Rizzo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1325419/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kristen Wiig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm1325419?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lauren Fleck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0191633/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John Cullum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0191633?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Richard Panatierre"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005459/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Liz Stauber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0005459?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sharon McCarthy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0227040/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mia Dillon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0227040?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Katie's Aunt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000379/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kirsten Dunst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0000379?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Katie Marks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1143816/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lily Rabe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm1143816?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Deborah Lehrman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1092022/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Esper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm1092022?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Daniel Marks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0644406/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nick Offerman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0644406?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jim McCarthy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0475218/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stephen Kunken"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0475218?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Todd Fleck"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0453003/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Maggie Kiley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0453003?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mary McCarthy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0566635/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Marion McCorry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1175709/characters/nm0566635?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ann McCarthy"}]}]}

The camera-work and the use of music were both truly superb, as well as the editing in which different sub- segments were all synced so well with the narrating of it by David Attenborough. \n\nIt was nothing like a nature documentary, it was way beyond that. The short and different segments, were movies on itself. It contained all the different genres, from experiencing the thrill in a Hollywood-like impossible action-escape scenario to having a comical and truly euphoric moment of realization about the true extent of what nature has to offer. And this was all brought so incredibly well.\n\nIf we had any more of such heavenly quality programs on TV, I would simply just glue my eyes to my TV and live out the rest of my life as a vegetable.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Planet Earth II Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2095757337", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjOGVlODctMjgzNi00OGMwLTkzYjYtYTIwZjcyZDUwOTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkyNzc3NjU@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjOGVlODctMjgzNi00OGMwLTkzYjYtYTIwZjcyZDUwOTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkyNzc3NjU@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-01-27T00:22:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0041003/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Attenborough"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5491994/characters/nm0041003?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - presenter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2016"}]}]}

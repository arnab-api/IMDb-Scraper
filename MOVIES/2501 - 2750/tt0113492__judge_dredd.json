He escapes and is on a mission to try and find the person who set him up.\n\nAnyone that has read the comics hated this film due to the fact that is apparently so different to the comics. From what I have been told, Dredd never takes off his helmet and reveals his face. Not in this film. His helmet is taken off within 15 minutes of the movies start. I never read the comic so I don't know any other differences, but that is probably why I enjoyed it.\n\nThis film has a very 90s feel to it. It reminds me in a way to Demolition Man. They are both set in the future and are both really good action movies, although Demolition Man is better. I do love the action films from the 90s. They have a good over the top feel to them.\n\nThe acting is alright in it considering it is a cheesy action movie. The movie stars Sylvester Stallone as Dredd. He looks uncomfortable in this role some of the time, but then Stallone does not suit some roles. A young Diane Lane plays his partner. She does a pretty good job. I was very surprised to see a cameo from one of my favourite singers\u0085 the legendary Ian Dury. He only had a very small part, but he was really good.\n\nThe effects and explosions were really good and well done. But that is what was expected from the action films of that era. The gun fights were completely over the top too\u0085 in a good way. I also loved the giant robot in the film. It was one of my favourite characters.\n\nIf you like cheese, Sly Stallone, futuristic films and never read the Dredd comics\u0085 then I can't see why you would hate this.\n\nI will give it 7 out of 10.\n\n\"I am the law!\"\n\nFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000230/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sylvester Stallone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0000230?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Judge Dredd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001705/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rob Schneider"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0001705?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Fergie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001884/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Max von Sydow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0001884?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Judge Fargo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0587151/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joanna Miles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0587151?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "McGruder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001267/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Balthazar Getty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0001267?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Olmeyer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0244443/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ian Dury"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0244443?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Geiger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001971/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ewen Bremner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0001971?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Junior Angel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532815/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Angus MacInnes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0532815?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Judge Silver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000800/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Armand Assante"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0000800?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rico"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001638/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "J\u00fcrgen Prochnow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0001638?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Judge Griffin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000178/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Diane Lane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0000178?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Judge Hershey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001040/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Joan Chen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0001040?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ilsa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0747687/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maurice Ro\u00ebves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0747687?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Miller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011478/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Christopher Adamson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0011478?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mean Machine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0547603/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter Marinker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113492/characters/nm0547603?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Judge Esposito"}]}]}

This movie was exactly what I thought it was going to be for the most part, but surpassed my expectations visually. I gave this film a 68/100. What attributed to that was the story itself was a bit of a stretch in my opinion and too many things went wrong...even for a movie. I thought Kaya Scodelario was good as Hayley in this and she really made the movie. A couple of things I also noticed.. 1. The wind didn't blow Kaya Scodelario's hair outside in the hurricane in a couple of scenes. 2. I know this shouldn't have mattered but was the director trying to foreshadow the importance of Gators in Hayley's life by her attending The University of Florida? (This did not impact my score but just a thought.) It did its job by keeping me entertained for a while but it was a little long. Every time you think something went right Hayley or the Dad makes a dumb decision..almost like every character in bad horror films. The CGI was good and the underwater shots were astounding..when people were being attacked the blood was used well and they really sold the injuries. Overall, this film is worth seeing...when it comes to Netflix or TV.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "In Theatres July 12", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi922336281", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3ZjgxZTQtMDZhMi00MmJiLTkzZjAtNzM0ZWMxNWI4YjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3ZjgxZTQtMDZhMi00MmJiLTkzZjAtNzM0ZWMxNWI4YjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A young woman (Kaya Scodelario), while attempting to save her father (Barry Pepper) during a massive hurricane, finds herself trapped in a flooding house and must fight for her life against alligators.", "uploadDate": "2019-05-02T13:19:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2546012/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kaya Scodelario"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm2546012?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Haley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6077056/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Morfydd Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm6077056?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Beth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8462585/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jose Palma"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm8462585?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Pete"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6978918/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Anson Boon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm6978918?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Stan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10133163/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tina Pribicevic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm10133163?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Young Haley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10831737/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cso-Cso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm10831737?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sugar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8063509/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Annamaria Serda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm8063509?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Emma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001608/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Barry Pepper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm0001608?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5105119/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ross Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm5105119?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wayne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5087756/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "George Somner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm5087756?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marv"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3615400/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ami Metcalf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm3615400?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10831736/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Srna Vasiljevic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm10831736?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Louie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0568801/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Colin McFarlane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm0568801?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Governor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8449814/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Savannah Steyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8364368/characters/nm8449814?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lisa"}]}]}

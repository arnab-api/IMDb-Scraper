Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include \"Fantasia,\" \"To Kill A Mockingbird,\" \"Casablanca,\" \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"North by Northwest,\" and \"The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"\n\nI have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.\n\nI cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as \"...the richest man in town.\" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.\n\nThe performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.\n\nCapra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.\n\nWatching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time."}, "duration": "PT2H10M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "It's a Wonderful Life", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1101988121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUyMzVmNjgtMWQ1MS00OTkwLWEzMTktOTFlYmRiNmE1MWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmUyMzVmNjgtMWQ1MS00OTkwLWEzMTktOTFlYmRiNmE1MWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Artisan", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:35:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000071/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038650/characters/nm0000071?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Bailey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000859/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lionel Barrymore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038650/characters/nm0000859?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mr. Potter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0871287/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Henry Travers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038650/characters/nm0871287?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Clarence"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269709/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Frank Faylen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038650/characters/nm0269709?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ernie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002108/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gloria Grahame"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038650/characters/nm0002108?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Violet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007214/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Frank Albertson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0038650/characters/nm0007214?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sam Wainwright"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0385594/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Samuel S.

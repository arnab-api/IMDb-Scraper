I've just come back from seeing it and thoroughly enjoyed it, but I wondered if for people who hadn't read the book or seen the TV series it would make sense, and obviously it doesn't. It also doesn't fit the change in perception that the current generation have needing an edit at least every 5 seconds and a linear storyline, that's not ageist, just what we in a much older generation have left as our inheritance, sadly. I really enjoyed the film references whether they are intentional or not, they range from Rear Window to La Nuit Americaine to Mr Bean's Holiday to Godard. Gary Oldman as Smiley is very good, much colder that AG and as in the book a bit younger. It is also less of the feel of a group of Oxbridge Dons in charge rather ex servicemen as MI5 was in those days. I was in my 20's in the early 1970's and the general dullness of everything during that time comes through very well. I would think that after they edited it they wished they hadn't had some rather crass graffiti so prominent, but I remember it was all over London at that time. Good film with a plot that makes you concentrate and you have to use your brain, well worth seeing, but don't go if you want thrills and spills."}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Domestic Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3394673689", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQxMDkxMDM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkyOTg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6's echelons.", "uploadDate": "2011-09-16T11:35:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0835016/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mark Strong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0835016?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Prideaux"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0610904/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zolt\u00e1n Mucsi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0610904?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Magyar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1128658/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ilona Kassai"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm1128658?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Woman in Window"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000198/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gary Oldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0000198?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "George Smiley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1399770/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "David Dencik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm1399770?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Toby Esterhase"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000147/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Colin Firth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0000147?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bill Haydon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1212722/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Benedict Cumberbatch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm1212722?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Peter Guillam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0631440/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arthur Nightingale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0631440?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bryant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000457/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Hurt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0000457?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Control"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0477577/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "P\u00e9ter K\u00e1lloy Moln\u00e1r"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0477577?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hungarian Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0190775/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Imre Csuja"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0190775?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "KGB Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429363/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Toby Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0429363?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Percy Alleline"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001354/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ciar\u00e1n Hinds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0001354?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Roy Bland"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121755/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kathy Burke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0121755?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Connie Sachs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0334318/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Stephen Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1340800/characters/nm0334318?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jerry Westerby"}]}]}

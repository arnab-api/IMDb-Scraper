A metaphor is one situation or statement that passes for another. Or a hidden meaning. Relic lays it out for all to see within the first few minutes.\n\nIt fails because despite a subject matter worth exploring, we really know little about the grandmother's prior life. We can't feel for her loss of memory and self without knowing the type of life she has led. For that matter we learn literally nothing about the daughters too.\n\nIf this film had some story or some actions that took you on a journey or something of any relevancy to pass the time, the lack of backstory might not matter so much. Where are the men for example? What happened to them? Does anyone care? What do they do with their lives that they can so easily give up to hang around in rural Victoria?\n\nSadly the first five minutes is no different than from minute 55 to 60. The writer/director tries the old red herring about a cabin in the woods (cliche), to throw us off track. That perhaps this is really a horror after all and a haunting is in place. It's a rookie error. Hitchcock called it the McGuffin, though even in his films, it didn't exist without some meaning. Here it's just a purposeless device.\n\nThe last fifteen minutes is very good. Especially the last shot. But the audience is far too bored by then to really care. Unless they, like some reviewers, think they're so intellectual, because it's a 'metaphor for dementia', and people who don't like it must be stupid. There's some irony. It's pure arrogance. No metaphor here. Just a lack of content.\n\nEmily Mortimer is a great actress but is given nothing to worth with. The relationships between all three are not developed in any way. It's style over substance. Yet there's really nothing that hasn't been seen in a hundred horror films, so the style in and of itself, is not enough.\n\nThere was potentially a great film here but it's underdeveloped and shows a lack of experience and foresight. It might have worked as a short film or even a short story but its prompt setup and subsequent meanderings is its undoing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi438550041", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZkYTkyYjctMTUyZC00M2QzLTkxZDAtODM5YTk5ZGUwNWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZkYTkyYjctMTUyZC00M2QzLTkxZDAtODM5YTk5ZGUwNWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "'Relic' tells the story of  Edna (Robyn Nevin), an elderly and widowed matriarch who goes missing, and her daughter Kay (Emily Mortimer) and granddaughter Sam (Bella Heathcote) who must travel to their remote family home to find her.

It definitely wasn't your typical superhero movie; and it wasn't originally a DC or Marvel comic. It's more about what would happen if someone with superheroes was around in modern times, and that is what makes it interesting. If there's some property damage done while catching criminals, people will be angry; if a vigilante has a bad attitude, people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public, as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero, but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a \"mask\" of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character, and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me, but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain; I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people, to do good things and the desire to be accepted. I think the best part of Hancock is that it's about a superhuman who is just very human. It was a lot of fun.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hancock: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2497904921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MjY1MjU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MjY1MjU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the second theatrical trailer for Hancock, directed by Peter Berg.", "uploadDate": "2008-05-08T08:14:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000226/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Will Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0000226?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Hancock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000867/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Bateman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0000867?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ray"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0550371/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eddie Marsan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0550371?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Red"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0280097/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maetrix Fitten"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0280097?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Matrix"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0301959/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Johnny Galecki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0301959?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jeremy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3049326/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dorothy Cecchi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm3049326?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Woman in Dive Bar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0326040/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Akiva Goldsman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0326040?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Executive"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0500894/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Brad Leland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0500894?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Executive"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000234/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Charlize Theron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0000234?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2052567/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jae Head"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm2052567?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aaron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0559869/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Mattey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0559869?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Man Mountain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0502073/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Thomas Lennon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0502073?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1190513/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hayley Marie Norman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm1190513?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hottie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1879319/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Michelle Lemon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm1879319?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Girl at Bus Bench"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000520/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Michael Mann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0448157/characters/nm0000520?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Executive"}]}]}

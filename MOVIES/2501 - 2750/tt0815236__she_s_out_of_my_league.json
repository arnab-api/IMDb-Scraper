Jay Baruchel plays an utterly average guy named Kirk, who is nothing more than mediocre in every aspect of his life, career, and looks. When a chance encounter leads to him meeting Molly (Alice Eve), a nearly- flawless woman (seriously, she's gorgeous in this movie) who seems interested in him despite all odds, Kirk has to deal with the new experience of being a 5 who's dating a hard 10.\u00a0\n\nSo yeah, that's not exactly a fresh, new story. That can be forgiven in a comedy, as long as it's..well, comedic. The movie manages to be pretty funny at times, but a lot of the humor is hit or miss. Something hilarious would happen, and then you'll spend the next five minutes wondering whether what you're seeing is supposed to be funny or not. Jay has been much funnier in other movies, and the supporting cast wavers between humorous and annoying. Still, the jokes in She's out of my League succeed more often than they fail.\n\nThe relationship between Kirk and Molly is a little hard to swallow at times, because she seems so determined to like him. Even though Kirk's personality in the movie isn't particularly remarkable. You actually start to believe their friends when they're constantly telling them that they're not going to work as a couple. The inevitable circumstances that cause problems for them seem extremely forced and predictable, as is their eventual reunion. There's little imagination involved in the story, that's for sure.\u00a0\n\nIt probably seems like I didn't particularly like the movie, but I did. It was quite funny in parts, and even the most generic parts of it weren't bad - just overly familiar. This isn't a bad comedy to check out, I just wouldn't go so far as to recommend buying it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "She's Out of My League", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi870384665", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNTkzMDU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMzczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNTkzMDU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMzczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A lost cell phone brings together an airport security agent (Baruchel) and a successful, beautiful woman (Eve) and, against all normal odds, they fall in love.

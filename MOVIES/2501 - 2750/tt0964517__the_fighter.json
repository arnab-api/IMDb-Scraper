Definitely. Does The Fighter succeed? Very much so...\n\nFor a film like this it is very difficult to make it completely unpredictable, yet while The Fighter is in a way conventional, it is also unpredictable many times. It has great characters to boot, but also a strong cast that is willing to give it their all. This is the best ensemble cast of the year,, many amazing performances. First, I start off with Mark Wahlberg, who has been the most under the radar, but he is definitely up for this. He is a great lead and I am surprised he was as good as he was. I am also very pleasantly surprised by Amy Adams. Not to say she is a bad actress, but I was always used to her roles all being similar and now she is in a completely different role for her, and to say she succeeds is an understatement. She is excellent, and is only made strong when sharing the screen with any other actor. Melissa Leo is also great, and I think she is on par with Adams. The difference between Adams and Leo is that Leo has the more award-baity role. Now we have Christian Bale, who I do think is the best. I have seen his performances and while he has always been good, he has never truly risen above others in his films, here he does. He is excellent, and he as of now deserves that Oscar.\n\nDavid Russel's direction is part of what makes this film so great, He soars scenes to unbelievable heights and I think that the screenplay in another director's hands would have came out with a merely good film. But here, we have an excellent film, perhaps better than 2008's The Wrestler, and one of the best films of the year."}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Fighter: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2330986777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5ODc4ODk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA2NDk4Mw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk5ODc4ODk2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA2NDk4Mw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A look at the early years of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him before going pro in the mid 1980s.", "uploadDate": "2010-09-17T08:27:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000242/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mark Wahlberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm0000242?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Micky Ward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0010736/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amy Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm0010736?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charlene Fleming"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3923953/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mickey O'Keefe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm3923953?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mickey O'Keefe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3578998/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Melissa McMeekin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm3578998?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "'Little Alice' Eklund"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3599667/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Erica McDermott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm3599667?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cindy 'Tar' Eklund"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0852256/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dendrie Taylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm0852256?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gail 'Red Dog' Eklund"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0483520/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jenna Lamia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm0483520?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sherri Ward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4209848/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Paul Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm4209848?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gary 'Boo Boo' Giuffrida"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000288/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christian Bale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm0000288?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dicky Eklund"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0502425/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Melissa Leo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm0502425?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alice Ward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569079/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jack McGee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm0569079?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "George Ward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0049099/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bianca Hunter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm0049099?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cathy 'Pork' Eklund"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2796810/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jill Quigg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0964517/characters/nm2796810?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Donna Eklund Jaynes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4136034/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kate B.

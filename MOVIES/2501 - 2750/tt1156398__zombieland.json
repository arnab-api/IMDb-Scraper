One day, due to the spread of an incurable virus, the whole of USA is over-run by zombies. He wants to see his parents in Columbus & during his journey meets up with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who loves to kill zombies. They are conned by a pair of sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) & Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). All of them become friends over their crazy journey across America.\n\nI seriously loved this film. The comedy is great, we care about the characters, the zombies are gross & the dialogues are seriously cool. This became one of my favourite comedy films of all time, as the character development is strong & there are laughs all the way through. This film has something which lots of films in this genre are missing, it has heart. The characters are warm & the little drama it has is very sincere.\n\nThe standout performance comes from Woody Harrelson who is Twinkie loving and zombie hating. Jesse Eisenberg is really maturing as an actor. His latest films have all been good. And his rules, God The Rules, that was so much fun. Abigail Breslin plays yet again the girl-who's-mature-way-beyond-her-age. It may sound boring, but trust me it is anything but that. Emma Stone as Wichita, I loved her. All the characters were endearing to me.\n\nThis will undoubtedly become a cult classic, much in the same way as 'Shaun Of The Dead'. A zombie comedy that's this good has taken too long to come after Shaun of the Dead. But it is definitely worth the wait:) \n\n9/10 -Girish,20", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The \"Kick-Ass Girls\" of Zombieland", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi179635481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A Zombieland featurette", "uploadDate": "2009-10-21T07:05:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0251986/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jesse Eisenberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1156398/characters/nm0251986?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Columbus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1297015/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Emma Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1156398/characters/nm1297015?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Wichita"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1720028/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Amber Heard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1156398/characters/nm1720028?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "406"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1737393/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Derek Graf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1156398/characters/nm1737393?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Clown Zombie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1156398/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tallahassee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1113550/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abigail Breslin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1156398/characters/nm1113550?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Little Rock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000195/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bill Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1156398/characters/nm0000195?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bill Murray"}]}]}

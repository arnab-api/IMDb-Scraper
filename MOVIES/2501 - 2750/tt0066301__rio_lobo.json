After the Civil War, Union ex-Colonel Cord McNally (John Wayne ) searches for the traitor whose perfidy originated the defeat of his unit and the loss of a close friend (Edward Faulkner) . The Duke then out to settle some old scores . In addition to an ex-Confederate officer (Jorge Rivero ) and an ex-sergeant ( Chris Mitchum) with whom he forms an uneasy alliance . They go to a little town called Rio Lobo where rules an ominous marshal (Mike Henry) and a heinous baron land named Ketchan (Victor French) . But the Duke takes prisoner Ketchan and imprisons him into jail for being brought to justice . Then he takes on a blockade of gunfighters and the nasty sheriff is out to get his kill-crazy boss . Duke along with a shotgun-toting old loony (the scene-stealing Jack Elam) are besieged and only helped by the Mexican/French ex-captain and the hot-headed Sergeant Tuscarora .\n\nAction western, snappy dialog , shoot-outs at regular intervals, and humor abounds in this magnificent film whose roles are splendidly portrayed . It packs larger-than-life characters, uproarious events and lively happenings. The Duke carries strong acting on his brawny shoulders and perfectly does. It's basically a lighthearted , upside B Western and being mainly lifted out by veteran Jack Elam 's wonderfully acting as a half-crazed sympathetic old man , whose finger itches demoniacally on the trigger every time he gets a nasty guy in his sights . And of course, top-drawer John Wayne , few stars could match his ability to dominate a scene . Delightful supporting cast formed by several youthful costars as Chris Mitchum , Robert's son who starred Rio Bravo ; a gorgeous Jennifer O'Neill , recent his hit in Summer of 42 ; Sherry Lansing's last movie as an actress who married William Fredkin and future Paramount studio head ; Susana Dosamontes who married a magnate and gave birth the singer Paulina Rubio . Glittering Technicolor cinematography by William H Clothier who adds much to the setting of this unique Western . Marvelous musical score by Jerry Goldsmith including emotive guitar playing . This overlong, too much-acclaimed and very gripping Western will appeal to John Wayne fans . Rating : Above average, essential and indispensable Western , a masterpiece horse opera whose reputation has improved over the years . The motion picture is well directed Howard Hawks supported by John Wayne , it's a nice Western made by these two giants . Hawks proved to be a Western expert as \u00a8Big sky\u00a8, \u00a8The outlaw\u00a8 and \u00a8Red River \u00a8.\n\nRating : Good and great fun , though over lengthy and displays a number of similarities to previous \u00a8Rio Bravo\u00a8 , quintaessential Hawks Western at the peak of his powers , starred by Walter Brennan , Ricky Nelson , Angie Dickinson and \u00a8El Dorado\u00a8 with James Caan , Edward Ashner and Arthur Hunnicut virtual retreat of the previous role played by Walter Brennan and again by Jack Elam in \u00a8Rio Lobo\u00a8in this second reworking of Rio Bravo; and of course the great John Wayne who repeats in the excellent trilogy .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000078/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Wayne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066301/characters/nm0000078?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Col.

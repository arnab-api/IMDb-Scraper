As the story develops the ice gets thinner and thinner, its incapacity to carry the weight of their fantasies advances faster than their growing inevitable end stop - maturity.\n\nThe Mexico of the teenagers and their generally stoned friends is one of affluence and political connectedness.  One father belongs to a country club that features one of the biggest private swimming pools I've seen - no film set here (the pool is the scene of a very, ah, unusual depiction of teen horniness).  Neither of the lads cares much about the actual political and social issues occurring during their adventures and which are seamlessly integrated into their story.  Their futures are a blank to them but a blank untroubled by the need to be concerned or ambitious.\n\nAnd then arrives the femme fatale, a beautiful, smart but very raunchy just-left-husband gal with whom they take off in a beaten-up old station wagon to find, ostensibly, a secret beach.  Of course what the guys have in mind is seduction.\n\nWithout a polemical discourse the viewer is carried into the isolation and poverty of much of Mexico as asphalt yields to hard dirt roads leading to barely navigable sand traps.  The people they encounter along the way are realized subtly but effectively.\n\nThese teens aren't really so likable but they do show occasional promise of growing up, a redeeming feature.  This is less a road film than it is a comedy of (very bad) manners. The director and three leading characters have taken raunch to a new and interesting cinematic plane.\n\nWhile these kids may be a parent's nightmare, they become more complex, and inevitably more insightful, as the film develops.  By the end they are very, very different people and in danger of becoming sort of plain vanilla post-teens (whatever the Mexican equivalent of the Japanese \"salaryman\" is, they may well be launched along that path).\n\nThis film is rated \"R\" but many will wonder how it avoided an \"X.\" Be forewarned.  But some of the sex scenes are hilarious - especially if the viewer has ever been a teenager. :)\n\nCuaron uses voiceovers not so much to explain the story but to quietly show that all lives have \"sidebar\" events beyond the tale being told, events that can be described in one or two sentences and which illuminate the fullness of a character's journey.\n\nThe scenery is gorgeous.\n\nDefinitely a different and engrossing story."}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Tr\u00e1iler [OV]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi557627929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDE5YjEwYTktN2NiYy00ZmZiLTk3YmEtOTYyYzljMTdkMGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDE5YjEwYTktN2NiYy00ZmZiLTk3YmEtOTYyYzljMTdkMGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-12-28T12:45:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0319843/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0319843?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Narrator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0526019/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Diego Luna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0526019?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tenoch Iturbide"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342400/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nathan Grinberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0342400?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Manuel Huerta"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1005692/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mar\u00eda Aura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm1005692?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cecilia Huerta"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0753810/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Arturo R\u00edos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0753810?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Esteban Morelos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0102744/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Diana Bracho"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0102744?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Silvia Allende de Iturbide"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0042144/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Marta Aura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0042144?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Enriqueta 'Queta' Allende"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719009/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Juan Carlos Remolina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0719009?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Alejandro 'Jano' Montes de Oca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1004635/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ana L\u00f3pez Mercado"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm1004635?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ana Morelos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0305558/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0305558?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Julio Zapata"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0486322/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ver\u00f3nica Langer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0486322?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mar\u00eda Eugenia Calles de Huerta"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1003995/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Giselle Audirac"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm1003995?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nicole Bazaine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1003962/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Andr\u00e9s Almeida"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm1003962?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Diego 'Saba' Madero"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0248408/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Emilio Echevarr\u00eda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0248408?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Miguel Iturbide"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0893941/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Maribel Verd\u00fa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245574/characters/nm0893941?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Luisa Cort\u00e9s"}]}]}

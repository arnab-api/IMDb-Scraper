Playing the title role is Jeff Bridges who is called that because he has a very special duty to be the one entrusted with the memories of the past. The ruling body of the society has to be able to refer to the past to be guided in making decisions. But we can't have everyone knowing about lest they long for the good things of the past. It's all been abolished the good and the bad, conformity and sameness is the order of things. Color is not even allowed everyone wears drab clothing like they were in prison. The family is abolished, kids are born and then assigned to nurturers, women particularly go into that occupation and it is an occupation like being a plumber. \n\nA new group of young people are being given new assignments and young Brendon Thwaites sits eagerly awaiting his occupation. He gets the prize as he is chosen to be the Receiver of all the past knowledge from Bridges. His training is to telepathically connect with Bridges all the experiences of the past, the good and the bad.\n\nThe use of color in film is never thought of this day, it's simply assumed that films now will be photographed that way. But The Giver takes its place along side Schindler's List and Pleasantville in using color sparingly and to make a point. Color comes into Thwaites world as it has been in Bridges' and the equation of knowledge with color is a point well made.\n\nWhen Thwaites decides that there's something more out there than what he's grown up with, society shakes. None other than chief elder Meryl Streep wants measures to be taken to stop Thwaites from questioning the order of things. \n\nThwaits, Streep, and Bridges head a cast that tells a thought provoking tale of curiosity and rebellion and curiosity in seeking something better always proceeds rebellion. The film ends abruptly and I suspect there's some box office soundings being taken to see if a sequel is to be made. I hope one is, but if it's not The Giver can certainly stand on its own.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Exclusive TV Spot", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3018304537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNzc0NzQwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ4NjYxMjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzNzc0NzQwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ4NjYxMjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In a seemingly perfect community, without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the \"real\" world.", "uploadDate": "2014-07-10T12:39:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000313/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeff Bridges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm0000313?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "The Giver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4154798/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brenton Thwaites"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm4154798?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jonas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005017/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Katie Holmes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm0005017?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1185747/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cameron Monaghan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm1185747?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Asher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4590173/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Emma Tremblay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm4590173?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lilly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6673561/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "James Jillings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm6673561?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gabriel 12 Months"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6673563/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Saige Fernandes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm6673563?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gabriel 6 Months"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177505/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Vanessa Cooke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm0177505?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Elder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000658/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Meryl Streep"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm0000658?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chief Elder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002907/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm0002907?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3843467/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Odeya Rush"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm3843467?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fiona"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2357847/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Taylor Swift"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm2357847?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rosemary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6673560/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alexander Jillings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm6673560?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gabriel 12 Months"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6673562/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jordan Nicholas Smal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm6673562?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gabriel 3 Months"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1998656/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Renate Stuurman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0435651/characters/nm1998656?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Dinah"}]}]}

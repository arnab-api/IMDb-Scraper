After watching the fantastic first thoroughly ENGROSSING episode, I can confirm that imo this is indeed already the best show we've gotten for UFO/Alien subject matter since the timeless early seasons of The X files. While it is heavily influenced from The X files in its structure, tone, and overall delivery, it stands on its own quite well enough to sustain its own identity. The acting is tremendous so far especially from Aidan Gillen and Michael Malarkey, and you really do become enamored with Dr. Hynek's fascinatingly brilliant character. Overall they did a terrific job portraying the true story it was based on with an extremely captivating first episode full of great twists, turns and solid mystery that keeps you wanting another episode immediately. The production quality is excellent with outstanding camerawork, vast settings, and accurate ambience and atmosphere to fit the late 40's/50's timeframe. A series thats definitely worthy of your time more so than most tv series.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "First Look Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2445785881", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwMDFlNDMtNjFjNC00NmVmLTgxZmMtM2IwNDg2MTgxMjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwMDFlNDMtNjFjNC00NmVmLTgxZmMtM2IwNDg2MTgxMjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "First Look Trailer - HISTORY's new UFO drama series \"Project Blue Book\" starring Aidan Gillen (\"Game of Thrones\") and Michael Malarkey (\"The Vampire Diaries\").

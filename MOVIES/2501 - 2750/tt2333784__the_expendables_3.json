I've long since complained about the state of a world where it's highest paid people are actors, singers and sports people. Though I'm a movie obsessive I'll never deny that they are offensively overpaid and Expendables 3 demonstrates that with the absence of Bruce Willis. They tried to get him back in a small capacity, just 4 days work and offered him 3 million. 3 million dollars for 4 days work! In response, he demanded 4 million and they decided to cut him loose. So think about this, a man being paid more for a days work than a minimum wage worker is likely to make in their entire life! That ladies and gentlemen is the world we live in.\n\nAnyway I digress.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as to say that The Expendables 3 entertained me but it certainly had its moments. The action was marginally better than the previous two films but it's saving grace was the cast. No I'm not talking about the same guys who have been phoning it in for the past two movies, I mean the newbies. Antonio Banderas stole the movie, he was brilliant. Snipes delivered like I haven't seen him do so in years and despite all the criticism I think Rousey did a great job as well.\n\nSo fine, it's not the big action blockbuster to end all action blockbusters but it blows the previous two movies out of the water. With a great villian, the new cast and a good lengthy finale it's passable stuff.\n\nThe Good:\n\nAs much as it pains me to say, Mel Gibson\n\nAntonio Banderas & Ronda Rousey\n\nThe Bad:\n\nRobert Davi was wasted\n\nStill mindless cliched stuff\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nEvery person on the planet without any formal training can wield any type of firearm like a professional\n\nThe moment Gibson was outed as a bigot, he started doing bad guy roles and nailed it every time\n\nI genuinely want to know if it's possible to attain/maintain a physique like Stallones without steroids\n\nCountless explosive shells fired from tanks at a building rigged with explosives won't set them off\n\nDisguising yourself as a bad guy complete with helmet without your allies knowing you're doing it in a full assault situation makes perfect sense", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Expendables 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1896197145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3Mzg3NTcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgzOTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3Mzg3NTcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgzOTAzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Barney augments his team with new blood for a personal battle: to take down Conrad Stonebanks, the Expendables co-founder and notorious arms trader who is hell bent on wiping out Barney and every single one of his associates.", "uploadDate": "2014-08-14T07:20:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000230/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sylvester Stallone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0000230?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Barney Ross"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000148/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Harrison Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0000148?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Drummer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000154/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mel Gibson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0000154?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stonebanks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000185/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dolph Lundgren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0000185?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gunner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0187719/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Terry Crews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0187719?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Caesar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1412974/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Glen Powell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm1412974?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Thorn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4244770/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Victor Ortiz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm4244770?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mars"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1553725/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kellan Lutz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm1553725?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Smilee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005458/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jason Statham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0005458?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lee Christmas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000216/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0000216?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Trench"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000648/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Wesley Snipes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0000648?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Doc"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1330276/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Randy Couture"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm1330276?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Toll Road"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001288/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kelsey Grammer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0001288?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bonaparte"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000104/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Antonio Banderas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm0000104?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Galgo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3313925/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ronda Rousey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2333784/characters/nm3313925?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Luna"}]}]}

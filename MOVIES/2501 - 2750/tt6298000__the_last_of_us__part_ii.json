I played it at a difficult stage in my life and had a lot of emotional attachment to the story. The relationship between ellie and joel, the character growth you felt while playing it, the survival aspect of them game, the atmospheric nature of it, the music, the pacing,... There are a tons of reasons of why the first game is a true masterpiece and why it's so highly regarded. As a true lover of that game, those characters felt real to me and could relate to the decisions they made during the story.\n\nNow fast forward 7 years to now, I legit did not have any doubts in my mind, that at least we will get a great game with a good story! The frustrating part is that I wasn't even asking for much! I knew that reaching the heights of the first game is going to be extremely difficult, however there are lots of directions that the game could go that you can make a intriguing story out of it!!\n\nBUT NOPE!! We got an absolutely ridiculous story that ruins the experience and even shatters some of the memories of the first one I am so disappointed. The technical aspect of the game is phenomenal!! The graphics, voice acting, gameplay,etc. Ahhhh just a massive shame! I am really really sad about this :( Oh well, life goes on and I guess 2020 is truly a terrible year!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Last of Us Part II: Accolades Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4029464089", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE5ODY4ZGEtNDJmZS00OGRlLWIyNTQtM2M4ZmZlMWNjYzllXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE5ODY4ZGEtNDJmZS00OGRlLWIyNTQtM2M4ZmZlMWNjYzllXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Last of Us Part II: Accolades Trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-06-21T09:01:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1684869/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Troy Baker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6298000/characters/nm1684869?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Joel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2208749/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Derek Phillips"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt6298000/characters/nm2208749?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jerry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4229526/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stephen A.

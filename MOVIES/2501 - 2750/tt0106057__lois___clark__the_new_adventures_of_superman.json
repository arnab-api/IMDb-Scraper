I read all of the comments here. The day I 'm sending this L&C's third re-run here in Greece is still continuing, but as I could see it's close to its end. Well, I have to say I 'm a BIG FAN, and I 'm glad to know there are also many fans of one of my favorite - ever TV series. I have to admit, though, L&C was not perfect. My opinion is that it was REALLY GOOD. It had a really good casting - Dean Cain (who is very handsome) is not that short, for God's sake! - and all of the actors fitted great into their roles. The script was also good, and I don't agree with the ones who said that after Lois and Clark's wedding it went bad. And of course I enjoyed the large amount of humor in it. About these flying - scenes... Well, the truth is they could be more and better. I have to say, I never was a Superman's fan, and I 've watched only one of Christopher Reeves movies. (And I liked it.) What is completely wrong for you to say (I don't mean to be rude), is that Dean Cain didn't try to make Clark Kent and Superman look different. OF COURSE HE DIDN'T!! Clark and Superman ARE the same person!! They can't be THAT different!! They have the same character, the same feelings, the same looks... because they ARE the same. They ARE one and only person. So, this is the right way for this role to be played. I agree also with this focusing in Clark's life. After all, HE is the main character. And the problems he has is what we want to see (and his struggles with the bad guys, of course), because, even if we know he doesn't really exist, we like to feel him close to our lives and feelings. If a Superman is what we need, and we can't have him in our true lives, let's just watch him! Last thing I have to say is that I would really like the idea to see Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher back as Clark Kent and Lois Lane again, to a new series or a movie. I hope I will. If I won't, though... I hope I see another Superman, because he's a really interesting idea. Congratulations to his \"inventors\"."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lois and Clark: The Complete Third Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4288020761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZmN2Y3MWMtZjhkZC00N2QxLWJiNmYtNjIzNWMyZWE3YWY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZmN2Y3MWMtZjhkZC00N2QxLWJiNmYtNjIzNWMyZWE3YWY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg", "description": "National Reel - Shared", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:03:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001002/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dean Cain"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106057/characters/nm0001002?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clark Kent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 1993-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809031/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lane Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106057/characters/nm0809031?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Perry White"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 1993-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428008/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eddie Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106057/characters/nm0428008?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jonathan Kent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 1993-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000159/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Teri Hatcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106057/characters/nm0000159?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lois Lane"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 1993-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0130282/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "K Callan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106057/characters/nm0130282?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Martha Kent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 1993-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0923529/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Justin Whalin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106057/characters/nm0923529?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jimmy Olsen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "66 episodes, 1994-1997"}]}]}

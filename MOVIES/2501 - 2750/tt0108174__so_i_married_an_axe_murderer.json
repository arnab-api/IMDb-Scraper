But like most films, it didn't leave a lasting impression. For some reason I have had a DVD copy of the film in my collection for some time now, probably a b-day gift or some such, and I never watch it\u0085Last night, sixteen years after it first appeared, I watched it again.\n\nSometimes, a piece of art takes time and multiple exposures for its audience to fully appreciate its quality. This is definitely the case with this film. For me, a film should show me new characters or new settings or give me a new way of looking at a recognizable situation. So often films just give their audience the same tired stereotypical content; Characters that differ in name only from other films and plot lines that so closely follow previous successful productions that I'm surprised there aren't more lawsuits between artists. Such is not the case with \"So I Married an Axe Murderer\". With the tiny exception of the girlfriend of the chief supporting character, every role can accurately be described as unique. A butcher shop owner/operator (Nancy Travis) for a leading lady that may be wielding her cleaver in the off hours plus her curiously flighty sister (Amanda Plummer). A suburban San Francisco family of intensely Scottish decent that includes the youngest son with an enormous head and a Mother (Brenda Fricker) who has no qualms about French kissing her eldest son's best friend just to assure herself he's good at it. There's a light aircraft charter pilot (Steven Wright) that probably shouldn't have been awarded a license and a slightly embittered, slightly maniacal former Alcatraz guard/now tour guide (Phil Hartman) who makes me laugh just to look at him on screen. There's an undercover cop best friend (Anthony LaPaglia) that wanted to be Starsky or Hutch but instead learns the job really entails filling out a lot of forms and his boss (Alan Arkin) who, if it wasn't for Mike Myer's performance, would have stolen the movie with his portrayal of a Police Chief that can only be described as the antithesis of that character that we've seen so many times in films and TV.\n\nAbout Mike Myers: Intensely likable. Free and easy on film at a young age he creates two wonderful characters that make us laugh hard throughout. As the lead Charlie McKenzie and as his father Stuart, Myers keeps the film moving with his paranoid yet irresistible charm from Charlie and his Robin Williamsesque quips that flow from his two characters accomplishing the most difficult task for such a performance; namely, entertain without distracting from the story.\n\nI've added this film to my \"Favorites\" list and recommend it highly. If you liked \"You Can't Take it With You\" you'll love this more contemporary yet equally quirky film of love and family.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "So I Married an Axe Murderer: Special Edition", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3990552857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY5YzczZDQtYmU3MC00Nzg1LWE3YzMtNTdjMGNiNDRkZmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY5YzczZDQtYmU3MC00Nzg1LWE3YzMtNTdjMGNiNDRkZmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-07-21T03:29:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000196/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mike Myers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0000196?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlie Mackenzie"}, {"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0000196?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Stuart Mackenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001439/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anthony LaPaglia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0001439?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tony Giardino"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002084/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brenda Fricker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0002084?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "May Mackenzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001301/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Charles Grodin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0001301?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Commandeered Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000529/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Debi Mazar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0000529?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Susan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0109956/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Patrick Bristow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0109956?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cafe Roads Performer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0620501/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Al Nalbandian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0620501?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Butchershop Customer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235478/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kiki Douveas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0235478?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Butchershop Customer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001802/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nancy Travis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0001802?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Harriet Michaels"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001625/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Amanda Plummer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0001625?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rose Michaels"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230596/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Matt Doherty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0230596?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Heed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0367005/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Phil Hartman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0367005?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0942833/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Steven Wright"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0942833?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pilot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0933194/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cintra Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108174/characters/nm0933194?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cafe Roads M.C."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561147/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "George F.

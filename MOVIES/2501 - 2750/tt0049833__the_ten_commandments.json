DeMille was a motion-picture producer-director whose use of spectacle attracted vast audiences and made him a dominant figure in Hollywood... He was successful in a genre - the epic - that he made definitely his own, until William Wyler came along three years later with \"Ben Hur.\"\n\nIn his first epic role, Charlton Heston is cast as Lord Moses, prince of Egypt, son of the pharaoh's sister... \n\nAs a true prince, he saves a slave's life; as a great prince, he gives the priest's grain to the slaves and one day in seven to rest; as a man of justice, he confronts Nefretiri with a piece of Hebrew cloth, the key to his origin; as a warrior and in excellent physical condition, he kills a tough and cruel master builder; as a courageous Hebrew, son of slaves, he tells the pharaoh: \"It would take more than a man to lead the slaves from bondage, but if I could free them, I would!\" As a man of prowess, he shows his latest methods of combat when he takes on the shepherds and routed them; as God's torch, he proves to be the Deliverer of the Hebrews, their prophet and leader; as the Lawgiver of the Covenant, he is the founder of the community; and as interpreter of \"The Ten Commandments,\" he is an organizer and legislator...\n\nYul Brynner is superb as Rameses, the rival of Moses... His arrogance and swaggering snobbery are well represented... Brynner delivers an intelligent cynical role... Regarding himself as divine, he rejects the demand of this unknown God and responds by increasing the oppression of the Hebrews... \n\nAnne Baxter is Nefretiri, the sensual princess who leaves her scar upon Moses' heart... Nefretiri is beautiful as a jewel, and her eyes green as the Cedars of Lebanon... For Moses, she is always ready to lie, to kill and betray... She is selfish in her life as certainly in her love... \n\nEdward G. Robinson plays Dathan, the chief Hebrew overseer who confessed to Rameses: \"Give me my freedom and I'll give you the scepter. Give me the water girl Lilia and I'll give you the princess your heart's desire.\" As a treacherous overlord, he charges to the people yelling: \"Go where? To drown in the sea?\"\n\nYvonne De Carlo plays Sephora, the midnight shepherdess to whom Moses is wed... Sephora couldn't fill the emptiness of Moses' heart, but promised not to be jealous of the memory...\n\nJohn Derek is Joshua, the stone cutter, who is totally convinced that Moses is God's Messenger...\n\nDebra Paget plays the delicate flower who quench the thirst of the working slaves... For her the hour of deliverance will never come...\n\nSir Cedric Hardwicke plays Sethi, the mighty Pharaoh, whose words to his son mark great significance: \"Who would take a throne by force that he has earned by deeds?\"\n\nNina Foch plays Bithiah, pharaoh's sister, who discovers the basket in which Moses has just floated down the Nile...\n\nVincent Price plays Baka the sadistic, covetous, murderous whip-wielding slave-driver...\n\n\"The Ten Commandments\" is filled with tremendous special effects: Moses's staff turns to a snake; Moses turning the Nile to blood; the Passover of the Angel of Death striking all the Egyptian first-born; the tremendous pillar of fire which halts Rameses' men; the Exodus from Egypt; the parting of the Red Sea; and the delivery of the \"Laws of life, and right, and good, and evil.\"\n\nThe relationship between God and man is the powerful drama in our world... Moses is 'every man,' in his pride and humility, in his courage and prowess, in his love and hatred, in his weakness and confusion,in his conduct and ability...\n\nDeMille's \"The Ten Commandments\" is a moving story of the spirit of freedom rising in a man under the divine inspiration of his Maker... It is a remarkable spectacle with great music, filled with exceptional setting and decor...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT3H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Ten Commandments: Blu-Ray Release", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3191315737", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZjYzJhOGUtODJkMi00OGJiLWFjMDEtN2I5MjY1YTA5NmM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZjYzJhOGUtODJkMi00OGJiLWFjMDEtN2I5MjY1YTA5NmM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Ten Commandments", "uploadDate": "2011-04-19T03:43:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000032/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlton Heston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0000032?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Moses"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000879/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anne Baxter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0000879?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nefretiri"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001119/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Yvonne De Carlo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0001119?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sephora"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001135/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Derek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0001135?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joshua"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001225/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nina Foch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0001225?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bithiah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000752/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Judith Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0000752?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Memnet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001017/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Carradine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0001017?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Aaron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0241523/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Douglass Dumbrille"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0241523?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jannes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000989/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Yul Brynner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0049833/characters/nm0000989?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rameses"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000064/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Edward G.

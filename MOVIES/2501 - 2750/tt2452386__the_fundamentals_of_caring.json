Just so that if there is any other soul looking here all confused if he/she should watch this movie or not. WATCH IT. JUST GO WATCH IT.\n\nAlright, so plot wise it doesn't have lot of characters who just pop in and out. It has a very simple story with simple cast doing simple things and that's the beauty of it. There is no over the top emotional scenes where the cast try hard to make you feel sad but there are simple doses of heartwarming scenes sprinkled throughout the movie which made my eyes wet. \n\nThe cast was amazing. I have always liked Paul Rudd and have seen his range when it comes to acting but still he managed to surprise me in this movie. I did not expect anything from Selena Gomez but she tries and pulls of the role she is given. Craig Roberts does an excellent job like in the movie submarine (which I obviously came to know after I watched the movie with the thought \"this guy looks very familiar. Where have I seen him before\" running in my head the entire time.). There are two more main cast members whom I don't want to mention and give away story details does real justice to their characters too.\n\nI didn't know the director either but he has done a really good job with this one.\n\nAll in all a really good movie. A must watch I would say. \n\nAnd ya, THUMBS UP to NETFLIX for making this movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1277146137", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4MTM2NTU5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNzUwOTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4MTM2NTU5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNzUwOTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Retired writer Ben becomes a caregiver after suffering a personal tragedy.

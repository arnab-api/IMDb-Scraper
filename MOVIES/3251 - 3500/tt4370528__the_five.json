A MUST WATCH!", "reviewBody": "My dad and I binge-watched this on a Sunday, after finding nothing else to watch. The picture looked interesting, the premise looked typical- all in all, I didn't go in with high expectations, simply something I could waste a day watching. Boy, was I wrong. My mind has been absolutely blown!! I was worried, that, like other British TV dramas (Marcella and Broadchurch in particular), this series would become overwhelmed by the introduction of unnecessary characters with their own subplots that held no real relevance or interest and only acted as a distraction to draw out the main storyline. This, thankfully, didn't happen! Every subplot that was introduced had a direct and crucial link to the story, and were interesting and not horribly complex so that the audience could see the relevance and not lose interest. They also didn't last the entire series, unlike Broadchurch, where nothing seemed to be revealed (AT ALL) until the very final moments, and by then, the influx of information was just confusing and frankly, underwhelming. In The Five, the subplots are resolved at the right time, giving chance for the main story to be explored properly. The characters were beautifully human, making you feel for them and made you really invested in their situation, and the acting was superb!!! THE TWIST! MY GOD! I have never been more in awe of a story! It was brilliant!!! I did NOT see it coming but when I saw it all come together, it actually made sense and was satisfying... Which is what I think to be the most important thing when dealing with mysteries. There were no questions left unanswered, no what if's or feelings that this revelation was subpar. And the direction was stunning. The way the ending was done made me sob like a baby, mainly because I'm an older sibling myself and I honestly don't know what I would do in Mark's situation. It's a series that I recommend with all my heart. If you like mysteries, plot-twists, surprises, suspense, family and friendship, crime then this is for you!! And if you don't, then I'd still say watch it regardless. I have never been moved as much by a TV show. Just wow!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url":

The movie was amazing.\n\nStory was pretty decent, acting was phenomenal, special effects were OUTSTANDING and everything just clicked in. It wasn't lacking anything; action was there, drama was there, comedy was there, romance was there ... from minute one to 127 it kept me glued to the screen, holding my breath at robot fights and laughing even at the smallest of jokes. \n\nWhat I liked the most was a chemistry between all characters; Charlie, Max and Bailey and each and every other character in the movie. They all brought the core of their characters to screen and blew our minds with their performances. \n\nI must say that I didn't expect this movie to be this good. My expectations were high for special effects and Hugh's acting, but what this movie brought was more than just that.\n\nRecommended for watching : it should be first on your non-watched movies of 2011 because it stands out by it's greatness and pure mind-blowing performances.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H7M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3446840601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNDU1NTgyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY4NDMyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNDU1NTgyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY4NDMyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A future-set story where robot boxing is a top sport and centered on a struggling promoter (Jackman) who thinks he's found a champion in a discarded robot.

It's a great Western, it's a great comedy, it's a great action, and it's a great drama. George Roy Hill did an excellent job with this movie. Paul Newman is one of my favorite actors, and who doesn't like Robert Redford? I just recently saw this movie and I was very pleased when it was over. They also managed to make this an accurate depiction, because, like the tagline states, for the most part, it's true.\n\n Paul Newman and Robert Redford do outstanding jobs as Butch and Sundance. They have make a great team, and it's fun to watch them rob trains and banks, and narrowly escape from the Pinkerton Posse. This movie also has great performances. The two actors make you like Butch and Sundance, and you want them to escape.\n\nI also thought it was interesting when I learned that the real Hole In The Wall Gang (besides Butch and Sundance)would soon become the Wild Bunch, or so I'm told. I find this movie a total enjoyment and can be enjoyed by anyone. I think that even the most shrill person can find things they like about this movie, so check it out, because it is and always will be a classic! 10/10"}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2377908505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU0NTFiODMtNzUyOC00NjUwLTg1ZTUtNGE4ODE3NjgzMGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU0NTFiODMtNzUyOC00NjUwLTg1ZTUtNGE4ODE3NjgzMGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Butch Cassidy And the Sundance Kid", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:57:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000056/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Paul Newman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0000056?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Butch Cassidy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001684/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Katharine Ross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0001684?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Etta Place"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428216/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Henry Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0428216?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bike Salesman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0299149/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "George Furth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0299149?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Woodcock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0144252/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ted Cassidy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0144252?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harvey Logan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0722413/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Donnelly Rhodes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0722413?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Macon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0779850/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Timothy Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0779850?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "News Carver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0225741/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Charles Dierkop"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0225741?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Flat Nose Curry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000602/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robert Redford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0000602?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "The Sundance Kid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001510/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Strother Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0001510?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Percy Garris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0179786/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jeff Corey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0179786?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sheriff Bledsoe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001458/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cloris Leachman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0001458?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Agnes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0550318/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kenneth Mars"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0550318?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Marshal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0318101/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jody Gilbert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0318101?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Large Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0444411/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Don Keefer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0064115/characters/nm0444411?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Fireman"}]}]}

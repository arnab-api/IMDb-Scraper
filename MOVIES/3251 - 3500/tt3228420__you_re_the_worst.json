It was instantly one of my favorite shows on TV and has only gotten better. It has plenty of funny one liners and silly situations, but it's real strength is creating interesting characters that have depth. This is the kind of show most networks would probably ruin by demanding the characters come off as more likable or moral. But FX has been bold enough to let shows like Louie, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Wilfred create strong characters who may not always be likable, but are always interesting.\n\nYou're the Worst is one of the most well written comedy's on TV. They respect their audiences intelligence and don't try to cram a well packaged moral out of every episode. They play television to it's strengths and savor the subtle changes in a persons life and a romantic relationship that a feature film wouldn't have time to show. The cast is has been terrific and their characters you'll grow to love despite the despicable things they often do. This show is brilliant and I hope it does well so there's more of a demand for shows like this.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "You're The Worst--Season 3 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi676050713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NTk0ODEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQwMjc3OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NTk0ODEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQwMjc3OTE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2016-08-19T03:04:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1357218/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Geere"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3228420/characters/nm1357218?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jimmy Shive-Overly"}, {"url": "#", "name": "62 episodes, 2014-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3210828/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Desmin Borges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3228420/characters/nm3210828?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edgar Quintero"}, {"url": "#", "name": "62 episodes, 2014-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2005930/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Allan McLeod"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3228420/characters/nm2005930?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Paul Jillian"}, {"url": "#", "name": "37 episodes, 2014-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1661282/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Janet Varney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3228420/characters/nm1661282?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Becca Barbara"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2014-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2251731/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aya Cash"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3228420/characters/nm2251731?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gretchen Cutler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "62 episodes, 2014-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1850967/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kether Donohue"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3228420/characters/nm1850967?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lindsay Jillian"}, {"url": "#", "name": "62 episodes, 2014-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0027522/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Todd Robert Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3228420/characters/nm0027522?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Vernon Barbara"}, {"url": "#", "name": "33 episodes, 2014-2019"}]}]}

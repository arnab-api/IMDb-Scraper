This is a really tough question to be honest, because when you give it a high rating, people will call you a sadist or even worse things (potential \"struggle snuggler\" if you know what I mean).\n\nAnyway in my opinion from what has been shown in the first 2 episodes the show is good at what it tries to be - an extremely dark revenge fantasy.\n\nThe main character gets heavily abused in the most horrible ways you can imagine. He starts out as a naive young adventurer limited to healing powers which severely limits his fighting capabilities. His healing capabilities are unusually strong though and therefore he becomes very valuable. As they have a heavy drawback he doesn't want to use them though which then results in him being forced into using them through said horrible ways of abuse.\n\nBecause of this he wants to basically take revenge on everyone that was abusive to him. And when you watch then you can basically see that at least in the noble and adventurer circles basically every person shown so far is pretty despicable and you actually want them to suffer and for the MC to get his revenge.\n\nThis show also is pretty straight forward in how the revenge is shown. We're talking about physical, mental as well as sexual abuse. So people should think on whether they can stand to watch it or not.\n\nAt the moment there is somewhat of a goal for the character to go in the story and it could be pretty good. However it could also be pretty bad. The story itself is somewhat shallow and the focus is on the revenge violence. And outside of the main character there isn't really any other character so far that you may want to get attached to.\n\nOne more thing I want to mention because there are people that complain about this show even existing. I think people should calm down a bit because even in the west there have been pretty hardcore violent shows and movies. The Saw movies would be one example of basically torture p***. Also let's not ignore \"The Boys\" which in itself is very graphic in what it shows. Just because this anime is very graphic with the violence doesn't make it any different from something like these other shows or movies. This one will either find its audience or not and get cancelled completely. And also let's not forget - these characters are drawn. So no one actually gets hurt or has to visually play these scenes. It's just animated pictures and voice actors.\n\nWatch it or don't - the choice is yours.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Teaser", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3477717273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjAxMThhN2QtYzY5MS00OWZmLTkwMjEtNzk2NTZkYzU5MDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjAxMThhN2QtYzY5MS00OWZmLTkwMjEtNzk2NTZkYzU5MDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "\"Healing magicians cannot fight alone\".

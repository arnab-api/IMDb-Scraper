Depp nails the cockney accent perfectly. Unfortunately, Heather Graham -- as the prostitute Mary Kelley -- is not as fortunate. Although her accent seems to improve throughout the film at various intervals, for most of \"From Hell's\" duration her British voice is quite stiff and the American twang is audible. The Hughes Brothers did not choose Graham for her acting abilities.\n\nThat said, the set design on this production is magnificent. 1880s London is brought to life and Whitechapel has never looked more realistic. The film is an odd hybrid of genres because it maintains the look and feel of a slasher film whilst presenting historical elements and painstaking recreations of actual murders. Robbie Coltrane, as one of the police officers involved in the case, has a lot of fun with his character and is fun to watch, and similarly as convincing as the scenery.\n\nThis is a very gritty and gory film -- more so than I ever expected. It's quite a strange beast with hallucinogenic visuals, horror elements and history thrown in for good measure, on top of some slightly modernized techniques. All in all this film kept me entertained because it was unique, and very different, and not particularly because it was \"great.\" I didn't expect a whole lot, but I felt that the movie was directed as ably as it could (or should) have been and the performance by Johnny Depp was deserving of a better film. The ending got a bit carried away, but it still presents a pretty cool twist on the whole Jack the Ripper scenario without totally insulting the intelligence or even upsetting one's sense of history. (Like Disney's \"Pocahontas.\") The respect the filmmakers have for their material shines through and elevates this above what it could have been. Definitely worth seeing, if only for its originality.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "From Hell", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi849674521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU3NjQ3OTktZmNlYy00ZGU3LWEzYWYtYzQwNTE5YTdmOWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU3NjQ3OTktZmNlYy00ZGU3LWEzYWYtYzQwNTE5YTdmOWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:00:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Inspector Frederick Abberline"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000453/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ian Holm"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0000453?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sir William Gull"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0007183/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ian Richardson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0007183?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sir Charles Warren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001020/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Katrin Cartlidge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0001020?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dark Annie Chapman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0528462/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Susan Lynch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0528462?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Liz Stride"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0789093/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lesley Sharp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0789093?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kate Eddowes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0568988/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nicholas McGaughey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0568988?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Officer Bolt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0656215/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Joanna Page"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0656215?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ann Crook"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001287/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Heather Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0001287?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mary Kelly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001059/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robbie Coltrane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0001059?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sergeant Peter Godley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002076/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jason Flemyng"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0002076?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Netley, the Coachman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0367731/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Terence Harvey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0367731?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Benjamin 'Ben' Kidney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0722631/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Paul Rhys"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0722631?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dr. Ferral"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0804700/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Estelle Skornik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0804700?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ada"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0032536/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Annabelle Apsion"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120681/characters/nm0032536?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Polly Nichols"}]}]}

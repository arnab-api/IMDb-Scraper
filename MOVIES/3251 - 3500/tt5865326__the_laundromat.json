This mixed with the unique style of Steven Soderbergh results in a quirky and entertaining movie about a rather boring topic. Its informative, funny, a bit sad at times and always extremely well acted. The most outstanding performance came from Meryl Streep who really surprises ( I am not saying too much here) and really links her unique humour with many deep moments. A really great performance, but who would have expected differently? Gary Oldman was also great. One of his funniest performances ever, never thought he had it in, Obviously Oldman had a lot of fun playing this role and it showed. Same goes to Antonio Banderas who also shines as Oldman's partner. Them breaking the fourth wall was sometimes a bit irritating but you got used to it very quickly. Another noteworthy performance was by Nonso Anzonie who was fantastic. Wished there had been more of Sharon Stone , I really enjoyed her cameo and character. Also Jeffrey Wright, almost unrecognizable, had some really memorable moments. The screenplay was really very well written and I really liked Steven Soderbergh's direction on this. He really managed to make such a dry topic entertaining. The only thing I really did not like too much was the very ending of it. Other than that it is a very good film and one of this years Netflix best.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2025307929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU3OGMzMjItZTMwZi00Mzc3LTllODgtNTE5ZjU0ZjdmZGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU3OGMzMjItZTMwZi00Mzc3LTllODgtNTE5ZjU0ZjdmZGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "'The Laundromat' follows a group of journalists who uncover the illicit money networks at the heart of the Panama Papers - documents that exposed a huge international system of legal swindling.", "uploadDate": "2019-08-28T14:58:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000198/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gary Oldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm0000198?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "J\u00fcrgen Mossack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2973791/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "AJ Meijer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm2973791?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hominid #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7217942/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lucy Morningstar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm7217942?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hominid #3"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000342/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "James Cromwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm0000342?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joe Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0606623/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jane Morris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm0606623?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Barb Sidley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3623142/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chris McLaughlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm3623142?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "First Mate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1851981/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Melissa Rauch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm1851981?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Melanie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7939906/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Brock Brenner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm7939906?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kaylen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000104/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Antonio Banderas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm0000104?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ram\u00f3n Fonseca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11046604/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Arsenio Castellanos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm11046604?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hominid #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000658/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Meryl Streep"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm0000658?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ellen Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0584673/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jeff Michalski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm0584673?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Norm Sidley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001598/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Robert Patrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm0001598?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Captain Paris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0667350/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jay Paulson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm0667350?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Pastor Conners"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8718123/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Juliet Donenfeld"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5865326/characters/nm8718123?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Thalia"}]}]}

One of the most unforgettable Euro movies of the 90's.", "reviewBody": "La Haine aka Hate is a story about three friends living near Paris in France (one Jew, one Arab and one black) who have nothing special in their lives and try to live a day at a time by drinking and having a good time and also working (at least the black character, who owns a boxing hall). Their friend, however, is captured by a police which tortures and maltreats him so badly that he is sent to a hospital in a critical condition. This makes the youth gangs in city including the three protagonists start a war against the police and authorities for the horrible wrongs they and their friend have suffered, and suddenly they notice the whole society is collapsing, and all there is is hate and need to revenge...Violence and mayhem is almost everywhere, including authorities which should do nothing but fight against it..\n\nThis film is powerful and grim. Totally unforgettable is the last scene which at my first viewing time blew me away. It comes very suddenly and there are no warnings what will happen at the end of this film. The message is so important and these marks of the \"apocalypse\" can be found in our everyday life everywhere. The society is falling and it is \"spinning\" as the voice over says just before the end credits..The film brings into question such horrific facts as racism which should have passed away long times ago, but no. Racism is such a primitive, stupid and despisable cancer among people, that there is no hope of better future if individuals don't understand the real facts of life and right ways to live with each other. Hate feeds hate as the character Hubert says, and that is something that our stupid race has not learned.\n\nThere is one very powerful scene just before the end scene and it deals with a skinhead and these three characters who could kill him right away and pay something back. It is very challenging scene and even Vinz, the most revenge seeking character, starts to see things different way after that. The whole point of La Haine is violence in all its forms. Why there is violence and why the hell it is used so often everywhere in every form? Don't we ever learn? These kind of films are important and so powerful that unfortunately people who should see them don't want to or they can't bacause it would be as a mirror for them..\n\nThe film is also a comment on power used by police as they are pretty tough and hard in this film. Police think that they can use any methods in order to get some answers, or in order to have some fun..It certainly doesn't judge police as \"pigs\" or violent sadists in general, but it is a warning example of what must NOT happen anywhere ever, by police or by others. One has to see through the film and to its core in order to understand what it says. Otherwise there is no point in watching these kind of films. La Haine is that kind of a film that it should be seen by police and youths as well, because there are still possibilities to prevent things to go too far in our life and world we live in.\n\nThe camera techniques used in this film are magnificent. Director/screenwriter Mathieu Kassovitz uses camera so smoothly and passionately and there are many similarities in techniques between this film and his more recent, Assassin(s). I am very happy for this young talent to have won the director's award at Cannes. These kind of talents deserve their prizes because there are so many stupid and worthless films which don't have nothing artistic in them and have nothing to say, and are just mindless and greedy entertainment. The black and white is very great element and the film strikes greatly without colors. The same case is with the Belgian classic Man Bites Dog, by Remy Belvaux, Benoit Poelvoorde and Andre Bonzel.\n\n A great masterpiece in French modern cinema and recommended for the fans of intelligent and important cinema so seldom found from big studios or Hollywood (there are exceptions, of course) nowadays.\n\n10/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bande-annonce [OV]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1231338009", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhmYTNlMTctZDE2Ny00OGMxLTgzNzctZDNiYzY5ODNiMjU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhmYTNlMTctZDE2Ny00OGMxLTgzNzctZDNiYzY5ODNiMjU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-02-12T14:53:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001993/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vincent Cassel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0001993?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vinz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0846548/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sa\u00efd Taghmaoui"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0846548?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sa\u00efd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0813217/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Solo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0813217?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Santo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0712205/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "H\u00e9lo\u00efse Rauth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0712205?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0009318/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Olga Abrego"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0009318?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Vinz's Aunt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0300404/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Choukri Gabteni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0300404?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sa\u00efd's Brother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0536095/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Beno\u00eet Magimel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0536095?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Beno\u00eet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0543963/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arash Mansour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0543963?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Arash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0468003/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hubert Kound\u00e9"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0468003?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hubert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0315760/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abdel Ahmed Ghili"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0315760?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abdel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597384/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Joseph Momo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0597384?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ordinary Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0906682/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rywka Wajsbrot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0906682?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Vinz's Grandmother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0479360/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Laurent Labasse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0479360?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cook"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0069945/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nabil Ben Mhamed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0069945?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Boy Blague"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0629202/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "M\u00e9dard Niang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0113247/characters/nm0629202?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "M\u00e9dard"}]}]}

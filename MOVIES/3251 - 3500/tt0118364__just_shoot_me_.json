It's like a league of its own because I noticed that it doesn't try too hard to attract a big audience. Usually NBC airs the previews for the Thursday night lineup and although they show Just Shoot Me previews, it seems like they tend to let it slowly slip through the cracks. \n\nNBC has a tendency to let good shows go bad by lack of advertising. Lets hope that this isn't one of the next ones to go. Just Shoot Me has one of the best times because it is after Friends, Cursed, Will and Grace, and before ER. I was reading some Nielsen ratings charts and it looks like people go out of their way to miss this wonderful show. I know that it is almost always in the top ten (I think), but I always read bad reviews or opinions on it. Why? It is so good and creative.\n\nThe characters are good because they are down to earth, hard working people. The cast isn't made up of the ritzy, glamorous celebrities we usually see. But it has one of the funniest casts I've ever seen. \n\nThe scripts are extremely well played out with hilarious writing. I always find myself laughing like crazy at some of the simplest jokes. Good writing with different story lines that don't get old is what makes this show one of a kind.\n\nGood characters, simple yet complicated problems/plots, excellent writing, and a good setting (the work environment) is what I love about Just Shoot Me. This is truly a must see!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Just Shoot Me: The Complete Third Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3487218969", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWY5NTk1MTUtYzNhMy00ODFhLWJkYTQtODUwOWNhZDE1MjlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWY5NTk1MTUtYzNhMy00ODFhLWJkYTQtODUwOWNhZDE1MjlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Just Shoot Me: The Complete Third Season", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T18:25:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000624/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Laura San Giacomo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118364/characters/nm0000624?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maya Gallo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 1997-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005176/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Wendie Malick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118364/characters/nm0005176?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nina Van Horn"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 1997-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005450/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Spade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118364/characters/nm0005450?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dennis Finch"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 1997-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001719/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "George Segal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118364/characters/nm0001719?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jack Gallo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 1997-2003"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0170186/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Enrico Colantoni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118364/characters/nm0170186?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elliot DiMauro"}, {"url": "#", "name": "149 episodes, 1997-2003"}]}]}

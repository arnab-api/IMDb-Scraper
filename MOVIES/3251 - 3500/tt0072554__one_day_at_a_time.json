Unfortunately, this character only stayed around one season ('76-'77). She was absolutely the BEST thing EVER about this sitcom! It was rumored that (inadequate) Franklin had her fired because she felt Wilson was upstaging her in their scenes together. The most annoying aspect about this show was the addition of Glenn Scarpelli as Alex Handris, who stayed around way too long ('80-'83)! With his big, greasy, pimply nose, awful acting & effeminate gestures his scenes were torturous to watch. Valerie Bertinelli's \"cutesy-poo\" persona was grating, but dorky Mackenzie Phillips was believable as an \"every teenager\" with her homely gawkiness. Bonnie Franklin is an awful actress & was totally unbelievable as an Italian-American, hence the Romano of her maiden name. She looked insane running to answer the door, with that big, Jack-O-Lantern head of her's. Schneider was the necessary buffoon needed for comic relief, but I never thought he was funny in any way. All in all, this was a good, ground-breaking show that dealt with the issues of it's day. (Norman Lear had a handle on this, in his heyday)."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "One Day at a Time", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2695413529", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5MzYxMGQtMGJmZC00ZWFlLTkxYmYtZmNjYTZmYTI5OWM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5MzYxMGQtMGJmZC00ZWFlLTkxYmYtZmNjYTZmYTI5OWM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2019-09-10T17:13:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0291364/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bonnie Franklin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0072554/characters/nm0291364?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ann Romano"}, {"url": "#", "name": "209 episodes, 1975-1984"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364224/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Pat Harrington Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0072554/characters/nm0364224?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dwayne F.

There's a lot of action. The good guys and bad guys are really blurred but that's a modern flick for you. The police gang unit team line up to go after a gang member in group housing, up stairs and into the apartment was legendary. Great camera work. You felt like you were lined up with them. Worth the price of admission. After viewing, very few audience members would want to A: Become a police officer in Atlanta, B: Be tasked with arresting a gang member who knows you're coming. Adrenaline time. That's the good, along with plenty of recognizable actors doing representative jobs with what they have to work with. Now for the Not as Good: The plot is there but it is ephemeral. You can kind of follow it but the exposition makes you strain for it. I'd like to say that's on purpose to add an element of mystery but I'm not real sure that's so. Not a thinking person's movie. I've seen worse plots but the bones don't hold up the body to make it recognizable enough, at least for me. By the end you can figure it all out but it isn't built up a block at a time. I enjoyed it and gave it a 7 but it's about a 7.5. Maybe a triple 7?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1446294809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTk5MTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwMjIxODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzNTk5MTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwMjIxODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A gang of criminals and corrupt cops plan the murder of a police officer in order to pull off their biggest heist yet across town.", "uploadDate": "2016-02-24T11:10:36Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0252230/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chiwetel Ejiofor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0252230?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Atwood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1107001/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Anthony Mackie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm1107001?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marcus Belmont"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0666739/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aaron Paul"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0666739?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gabe Welch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2933757/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gal Gadot"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm2933757?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Elena Vlaslov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1954240/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Teresa Palmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm1954240?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michelle Allen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004286/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Clifton Collins Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0004286?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Franco Rodriguez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0741893/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Terence Rosemore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0741893?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Joshua Parks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6509716/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Alexander Babara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm6509716?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ben Feldman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000729/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Casey Affleck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0000729?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chris Allen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000437/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Woody Harrelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0000437?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jeffrey Allen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000701/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kate Winslet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0000701?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Irina Vlaslov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005342/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Norman Reedus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0005342?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Russell Welch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0931324/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Michael Kenneth Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0931324?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sweet Pea"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0029391/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Michelle Ang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm0029391?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Trina Ling"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4581476/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Terri Abney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1712261/characters/nm4581476?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Leah Green"}]}]}

The Thin Blue Line is an old-fashioned farce set in a city police station.  That's not to say it's bad--it's actually very funny, just not anything groundbreaking.  A lot of the humor derives from playing stereotypes against themselves:  our heroes are bumbling cops who manage to make fools of themselves while eventually solving the crimes and making fools of the bad guys (not to mention the detective division) in the end.  Goody, who could be described as a flaming heterosexual, manages to combine a full repertoire of \"nelly\" mannerisms with a hopeless crush on Habib.  Habib herself is both a stereotype (attractive young female character constantly pursued by almost every male character) and a skewerer of stereotypes.  This show has its cake and eats it too, but the viewer is too busy laughing to question any of it.  And in the tradition of the best British farces, it goes to unbelievable lengths to track down and hammer home every conceivable double entendre and smutty one-liner.  When one finishes groaning and/or laughing, one can't help but admire such perseverance in the pursuit of craft.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000100/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rowan Atkinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112194/characters/nm0000100?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Inspector Raymond Fowler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 1995-1996"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0237834/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Dreyfus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112194/characters/nm0237834?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "P.C.

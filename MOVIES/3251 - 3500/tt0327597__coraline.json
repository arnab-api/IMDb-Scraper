That reality is sort of similar to the life she already knows yet deeply unsettling in a number of ways. Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) begins a journey of adventure and self discovery when her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) relocate the family to Oregon from Michigan. No one in this new space has time for her so she spends her time exploring her new neighborhood with an talkative local boy named Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.). After discovering the odd neighbors all of whom are true characters, she is still bored somehow.\n\nAll of this immense undertaking is courtesy writer and director Henry Selick, director of Nightmare Before Christmas, and the well crafted adaptation of Neil Gaiman's international best-selling children's novel. To Selick's credit this is the first 3D stop motion ever made; stereoscopic 3D. Selick himself worked on the film for three years. The style is stunning and the story is an unwavering fairy-tale nightmare that has some genuinely scary moments. is a masterful movie and an exciting tale of mystery and imagination.\n\nIn the rotting nooks and crannies of Coraline's new home the real story begins and where she discovers a hidden doorway behind the wallpaper. Inside is her alternate space where there are doubles of her distracted parents now lavish loving attention on Coraline, the oddball neighbors are friendlier, and her pesky friend long longer speaks. Only her parents' eyes now black buttons give a clue that something isn't quite right.\n\nSelick has created a world as much for adults as children as there are references dotted throughout that the young won't understand. The imagery, however, is very child like. Both talents live side by side and bodes well for Selick's previous work in Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach and even Monkeybone. His work has always been fascinating. Gaiman is to be credited with the story for sure, but this is Selick through and through. This film is sure to become an instant classic and as well executed as this movie is it should be.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Coraline", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi513934105", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3OTUzMDI0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU4MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3OTUzMDI0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU4MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Coraline - The first trailer for the upcoming 3D stop-motion animated film.", "uploadDate": "2008-11-26T09:18:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0266824/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dakota Fanning"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0266824?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Coraline Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0766837/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jennifer Saunders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0766837?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Miss April Spink"}, {"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0766837?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Other Spink"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0202966/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Keith David"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0202966?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "The Cat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0047121/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Robert Bailey Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0047121?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Wyborne 'Wybie' Lovat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3274463/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Aankha Neal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm3274463?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sweet Ghost Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2575704/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hannah Kaiser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm2575704?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tall Ghost Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2759811/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Marina Budovsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm2759811?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Photo Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0710019/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jerome Ranft"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0710019?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mover"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000159/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Teri Hatcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0000159?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mel Jones"}, {"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0000159?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Other Mother"}, {"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0000159?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Beldam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0294067/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dawn French"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0294067?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Miss Miriam Forcible"}, {"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0294067?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Other Forcible"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1894655/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Hodgman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm1894655?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Charlie Jones"}, {"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm1894655?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Other Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0574534/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ian McShane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0574534?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mr. Sergei Alexander Bobinsky"}, {"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm0574534?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Other Bobinsky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3275474/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "George Selick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm3275474?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ghost Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3275272/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Harry Selick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm3275272?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Photo Friend"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3274479/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Emerson Tenney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0327597/characters/nm3274479?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Magic Dragonfly"}]}]}

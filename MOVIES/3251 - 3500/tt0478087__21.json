Their sleazy math professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), leads the group. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. With all that preparation, the group's scheme does work ... for a while. And in the process, the shy, cautious Ben, who only wants the money for tuition costs, morphs into his alter ego, a person quite unlike his original self.\n\nThe film's pace starts off leisurely, then alternates between fast-paced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend, fellow conspirator Jill (Kate Bosworth), talk shop and take in the high life. The story does have a villain, but it may not be who you think it is.\n\nThe script's dialogue is snappy and hip, and contains minimal tech jargon. \"Variable change\" is one such math term, and it has thematic implications toward the end, as the story twists and turns in ways that may surprise you. And \"winner winner, chicken dinner\" is the group's lingo for gambling success.\n\nProduction design is realistic and lavish; this is a big budget film. Color cinematography, by DP Russell Carpenter, is polished and slick. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close-ups. The best parts of the film are the close-ups of the characters at the blackjack tables. Film editing coincides with plot pacing, and ranges from slow to super fast. Acting is all-around good. Kevin Spacey gives his usual topnotch acting job; Sturgess and Bosworth also give fine performances.\n\nIt's not a perfect film. Background music was noisy and rather nondescript for my taste. And I could have wished for more card playing, and less time spent on Ben's college buddies in the first Act; the result is that the film gets off to a slow start. Still, the script is credible, and stays close to its book source \"Bringing Down The House\" by Ben Mezrich.\n\nThematically relevant in today's world of greed and materialism, \"21\" is a terrific film, one that has greater import than other films, because the events in \"21\" really happened. And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel, to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer for 21", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi313655577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMzEyMjEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE5MzQ4._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMzEyMjEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE5MzQ4._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for 21", "uploadDate": "2007-11-27T16:43:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0836343/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Sturgess"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0836343?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0098378/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kate Bosworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0098378?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jill"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0487594/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Liza Lapira"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0487594?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kianna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000401/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Laurence Fishburne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0000401?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cole Williams"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1265802/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Josh Gad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm1265802?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Miles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0136962/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Helen Carey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0136962?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ellen Campbell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2950920/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Donna Lows"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm2950920?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Planet Hollywood Dealer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2951275/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ben Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm2951275?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Planet Hollywood Dealer Jeff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000228/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kevin Spacey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0000228?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Micky Rosa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1683094/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aaron Yoo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm1683094?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Choi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686009/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jacob Pitts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0686009?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fisher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569079/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jack McGee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0569079?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Terry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1758979/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sam Golzari"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm1758979?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0319636/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jack Gilpin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm0319636?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bob Phillips"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2950960/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Butch Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0478087/characters/nm2950960?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Planet Hollywood Dealer"}]}]}

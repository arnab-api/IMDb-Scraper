He then dares the criminal justice system, in the person of assistant district attorney Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), to convict him. That Crawford likes playing games with the system quickly becomes apparent, and is the force that propels the plot forward.\n\nThe story has some believability issues. I question how Crawford can know all that he knows, with such certainty. There are also some problems toward the film's end that involve hospital protocol. And the overall plot progression depends on various contrivances that include, but are not limited to, police procedures. The entire concept borders on implausibility. But, if you don't pay too much attention to these annoying little details, the plot does roll merrily along with some good drama and suspense.\n\nAnthony Hopkins is well cast as Crawford, and gives a predictably adroit performance. I would not have cast Ryan Gosling, with his boyish looks, as an assistant DA. Nevertheless, Gosling's performance is both lively and credible. And it's the back and forth verbal sparring between these two that make \"Fracture\" so entertaining.\n\nThe film's color cinematography is very good, and includes some unusual camera angles. I also liked the use of a wide-angle lens in the courtroom scenes. And sound effects, so often ignored in many films, further add to the realism of the settings.\n\nDialogue is generally effective, and includes some witty lines. When Willy's boss talks with him about being taken off the case, Willy responds: \"Even if I find new evidence?\" To which his boss retorts: \"From where, the evidence store?\"\n\nDespite a seriously flawed script, \"Fracture\" is a highly absorbing movie, thanks largely to meticulous production values, and to shrewd performances from Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling."}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fracture", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1369964825", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JmNmQ1YzAtZWY2YS00MTYzLWFkY2QtNGU3NTQ0OTE1ZDk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2JmNmQ1YzAtZWY2YS00MTYzLWFkY2QtNGU3NTQ0OTE1ZDk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from New Line Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:11:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000164/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Anthony Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0000164?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ted Crawford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000657/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "David Strathairn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0000657?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "DA Joe Lobruto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001110/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Embeth Davidtz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0001110?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jennifer Crawford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0193295/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cliff Curtis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0193295?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Detective Flores"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0348409/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bob Gunton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0348409?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Judge Gardner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0075359/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Xander Berkeley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0075359?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Judge Moran"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0779399/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Judith Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0779399?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Resident"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0120838/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Petrea Burchard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0120838?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dr. Marion Kang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0331516/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ryan Gosling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0331516?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Willy Beachum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0683253/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rosamund Pike"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0683253?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nikki Gardner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121605/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Billy Burke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0488120/characters/nm0121605?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lt.

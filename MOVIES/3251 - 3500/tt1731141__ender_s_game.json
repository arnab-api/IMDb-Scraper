It is needed to be said in the review, because even with all the effort it is impossible for me to review the movie without influence of the book.\n\nMovie did actually better job than I expected. I liked the cast of the main characters, Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield. Both did very good job. A big positive surprise for me was the visual aspect of the movie, I liked it actually so much, it is the main reason, why I keep my rating for the movie so high despite the negatives.\n\nThe biggest problem of the Ender's Game adaptation is the race against the time. The movie tries to squeeze huge amount of information in a short time and it just does not work. I cannot imagine, how I would feel without having any background information from the book. Even if we can discuss whether the \"Earth\" sideline with Ender's siblings has to or doesn't have to be in the movie (it does not), there is the main storyline describing Ender's time spend in Battle school and it is handled so shallowly and quickly, it hurts. This story just needs more space. Without it there is almost no character development. No emotions towards side characters, like Bean or Petra or all the others, barely recognizable for the viewer. Even the great ending is ripped of emotions partially because of it. I felt all the aspects of the movie are more handled as trailers to that aspect than actually diving into it. And it is a pity.\n\nIt was still a nice experience, seeing the universe come to life.\n\nRemember, the enemy's gate is down!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "UK Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3482626073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMDk0OTE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzExNzA5MjI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMDk0OTE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzExNzA5MjI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "With an alien invasion imminent, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) and the International Fleet are depending on Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) to save mankind.", "uploadDate": "2013-10-08T09:40:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2633535/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Asa Butterfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm2633535?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ender Wiggin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2794962/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hailee Steinfeld"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm2794962?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Petra Arkanian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001426/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ben Kingsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm0001426?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mazer Rackham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2026536/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Aramis Knight"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm2026536?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2030779/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Moises Arias"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm2030779?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bonzo Madrid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1245547/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jimmy 'Jax' Pinchak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm1245547?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peter Wiggin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2474692/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Conor Carroll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm2474692?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bernard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4361704/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cameron Gaskins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm4361704?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Slattery (Leopard Army)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000148/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Harrison Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm0000148?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Colonel Graff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1113550/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Abigail Breslin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm1113550?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Valentine Wiggin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0205626/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Viola Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm0205626?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Major Gwen Anderson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4753307/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Suraj Partha"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm4753307?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4240577/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Khylin Rhambo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm4240577?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dink Meeker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1996829/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nonso Anozie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1731141/characters/nm1996829?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sergeant Dap"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4837448/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Caleb J.

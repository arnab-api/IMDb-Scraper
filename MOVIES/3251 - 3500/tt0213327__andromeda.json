My young daughter used to watch it with me, but now she would rather do homework.\n\nAfter the first two seasons of decent action, sub plots etc, the story lines started to get stupid in season 3. There was more action in season 4 but the final show was one of the worst I have seen on any show.\n\nSeason 5 has limped along with too few interesting stories, little character development, new long term \"bad guys\", little good action (same karate type fight sequences where Sorbo gets to kick people, and the introduction of the \"busty\" Doyle character adds nothing to the cast. In fact she detracts from time that could be spent with other regulars. When the season 5 DVD comes out, they should edit the whole season down to about 2 hours, but then it would really not make much sense.\n\nI've heard Sorbo has taken more direct control of the show as it has continued....what a shame. The \"artsy\" look and inane stories remind one of a boxer well past his prime trying to do what he did years ago and continually getting sent to the mat.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Andromeda: Season 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3417702681", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE0NzZjNWUtMWZhMi00NmQ3LTkxZmMtMDcyNzdjZDEyNzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE0NzZjNWUtMWZhMi00NmQ3LTkxZmMtMDcyNzdjZDEyNzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from ADV Films", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T11:40:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001757/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Sorbo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0213327/characters/nm0001757?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain Dylan Hunt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 2000-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0078324/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Bertram"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0213327/characters/nm0078324?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Trance Gemini"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 2000-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230693/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lexa Doig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0213327/characters/nm0230693?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Andromeda Ascendant"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 2000-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0045584/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Steve Bacic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0213327/characters/nm0045584?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Telemachus Rhade"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 2000-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0753121/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lisa Ryder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0213327/characters/nm0753121?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Beka Valentine"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 2000-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0941315/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gordon Michael Woolvett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0213327/characters/nm0941315?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Seamus Harper"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 2000-2005"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167788/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Keith Hamilton Cobb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0213327/characters/nm0167788?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tyr Anasazi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 2000-2005"}]}]}

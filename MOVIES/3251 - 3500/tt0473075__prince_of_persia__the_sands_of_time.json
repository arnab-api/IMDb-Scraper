The average user ranking on MC puts it at 9 out of 10.\n\nMost reviews range anywhere from 8 out of 10, to as low as 2 or 3 out of 10.\n\nIf there's one thing critics can agree on, its that the movie is clich\u00e9d, borrowing elements from plenty of epics based in the Middle East and fantasy alike, and that it's loads of fun.\n\nThe one thing no one can agree on is whether that's good or bad.\n\nIt should be pointed out that this film is produced by the same company/studio that brought us 'Pirates of the Caribbean', and it certainly shows.\n\nWith that said, I'll lead into my thoughts on the film. The first \"Pirates\" scored on average a 7.8 - 6.4 of 10, while the sequels averaged anywhere from 4.5 to 5.3. I'd say this movie is better than the sequels while not as good as the first. \n\nSo, I'd give it roughly a 7 out of 10.\n\nThe story is fun, for what it is. Which is a rough retelling of the video game \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\", while incorporating elements of the following two sequels, as well as incorporating stylistic elements from the following game and the first three of the original trilogy. Thats right! Based loosely on one game, borrowing elements from SIX more. The movie is stretched too thin, and it shows.\n\nThe movie feels like your prototypical \"sword and sandal\" action flick, borrowing heavily from films like \"The Thief of Baghdad\", and stories found in \"1001 Nights\". So think 'Arabian Nights', Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, Aladdin, all mixed with some Steve Reeves 'Hercules' and Robert E. Howard 'Conan' flash.\n\nIs it as cheesy as that sounds? YES! Is it as awesome as that sounds? YES!\n\nBut it's still well edited, well acted, well scored (Harry Gregson-Williams never fails), and overall well done enough to merit an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe ONLY complaints I can think of are few, but here they are: A bit too much CGI, not on the stunts (not much CGI there surprisingly) but on things like demonic-esque snakes (you'll see). Too much random slow-motion. The sexual-tension seemed too forced (too many of those really slow \"they're about to kiss but don't\" moments). And whereas yes, the ending is supposed to have a \"Deus-Ex-Machina\" feel to it, in the game it is much more thorough and more explained, in the movie you're just expected to roll with it.\n\nOther than that. A fun night at the movies! Grab your over-priced candy, soda, and popcorn (or do like me and sneak snacks in) and have fun with friends, family and loved ones, recapturing the fun escapism of your childhood with an epic but clich\u00e9 action movie.\n\nHope you enjoyed my review... And I hope you enjoy the movie too!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time - Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3849520153", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1ODc5MTk5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcyNTIyMw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1ODc5MTk5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcyNTIyMw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Set in medieval Persia, a rogue prince (Jake Gyllenhaal) joins a mysterious princess (Gemma Arterton) in an effort to prevent a dark force from obtaining an ancient dagger that allows its handler to rule the world.", "uploadDate": "2010-03-05T11:48:04Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0350453/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jake Gyllenhaal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0350453?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dastan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001426/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ben Kingsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0001426?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nizam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0869750/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Steve Toussaint"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0869750?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Seso"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185404/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Richard Coyle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0185404?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2201022/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Reece Ritchie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm2201022?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0655401/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Claudio Pacifico"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0655401?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hassansin Porcupine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1586674/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dave Pope"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm1586674?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hassansin Giant Scimitar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0879648/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Massimiliano Ubaldi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0879648?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hassansin Long Razor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2605345/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gemma Arterton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm2605345?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tamina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000547/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alfred Molina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0000547?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sheik Amar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1527905/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Toby Kebbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm1527905?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Garsiv"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0681975/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ronald Pickup"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0681975?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "King Sharaman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1458629/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "G\u00edsli \u00d6rn Gar\u00f0arsson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm1458629?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hassansin Leader"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0243345/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Thomas DuPont"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm0243345?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Hassansin Whip Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1425725/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Domonkos Pardanyi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0473075/characters/nm1425725?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hassansin Double-Bladed Halberd"}]}]}

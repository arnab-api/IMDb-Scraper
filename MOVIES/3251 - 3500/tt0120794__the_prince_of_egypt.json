If you aspire to art in any form, and/or specifically love line art and graphics as I do, you must not miss seeing this film on the big screen.  I applaud DreamWorks for this triumph in graphic excellence.\n\n Two brief critiques: First, the choice of story.  The story is based on Exodus from the Old Testament (and other Scripture) which is scanty, to say the least.  Although the studio made an effort to flesh out the story with the Ramses/Moses relationship there is simply not enough meat to go around. This opinion is debatable, a very minor aspect and only my view as a story teller.  At the bottom line the overall work is so extraordinary any possible lack in literacy is more than made up for in the visual mounting and production of the film, something which is nothing less than inspiring.\n\nThe other criticism is in the highly questionable use of \"name\" voices for casting, a puzzling development since there is no meaningful box office data supporting it.  This practice is known to conflict the viewer psychologically as the drawn images begin to do battle with the ones in the audience memory with the cerebral bridge of highly recognizable photo images of known voices. Walt Disney knew this quite well and avoided it.  Indeed, he used the voice of a complete unknown for Snow White, Adriana Caselotti, (who passed away in 1997).  Disney was careful to avoid the existing Hollywood queens of song of the period, Judy Garland  and Deanna Durbin, the latter, whose prodigious vocal talent actually saved Universal Pictures from going belly up a short time later.\n\nHowever, at the bottom line, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT will become a true classic and has taken the art of animation up to a new threshold, a model to which future animators will aspire.\n\nRaul daSilva, New Haven, CT, USA"}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Prince of Egypt", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2683437337", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlYzFhNzMtNWM2My00MmRhLTkxOTgtODdjMWM2OWMyZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlYzFhNzMtNWM2My00MmRhLTkxOTgtODdjMWM2OWMyZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Dreamworks Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:42:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000174/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Val Kilmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000174?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Moses"}, {"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000174?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "God"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000201/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michelle Pfeiffer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000201?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tzipporah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000156/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jeff Goldblum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000156?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aaron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001772/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Patrick Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0001772?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Seti"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000188/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Steve Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000188?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hotep"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0609424/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bobby Motown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0609424?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rameses Son"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0371866/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ofra Haza"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0371866?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Yocheved"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0193631/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Aria Noelle Curzon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0193631?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Additional Voices"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000146/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ralph Fiennes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000146?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rameses"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000113/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sandra Bullock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000113?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Miriam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000418/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Danny Glover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000418?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jethro"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000545/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Helen Mirren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0000545?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "The Queen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001737/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Martin Short"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0001737?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Huy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0726180/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Eden Riegel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0726180?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Young Miriam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0043041/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "James Avery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120794/characters/nm0043041?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Additional Voices"}]}]}

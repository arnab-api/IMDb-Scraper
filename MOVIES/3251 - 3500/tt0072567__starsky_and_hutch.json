Drugs were a big part of this show, it depicted the drawbacks to using drugs and illustrated the delirium that they put many destitute walks of life into! Paul Michael Glaser was sensational as the totally guy's guy detective!! His personality went beyond likable, his role as Starsky was a big component in making this series extremely entertaining!! David Soul was excellent as well, as the all American detective Hutch, he definitely sparked an identifiability with the television viewer!! The rest of the cast was realistically portrayed in keeping with the time (the 1970's) that this show aired!! The '2005 movie was more of a satire of the original series, and was amusing more than anything else!! As a kid, I liked \"Starsky and Hutch\" a lot and I am glad that it was a big part of my childhood television viewing!! I give it a thumbs up!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Starsky & Hutch: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2746400025", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhmMGNhYTItMzY2MS00YWIwLWI5YTQtZTllZGZjMzgzNDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhmMGNhYTItMzY2MS00YWIwLWI5YTQtZTllZGZjMzgzNDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Starsky & Hutch: Season 1", "uploadDate": "2019-03-14T23:47:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0815800/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "David Soul"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0072567/characters/nm0815800?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Det.

It seems to have a cast and crew of around ten people, which is not often enough to make a movie. And then it is found footage, which is by far the worst trend in horror today. Even more than zombies, which is hard to believe.\n\nThere are moments that make no sense, because you might wonder why a camera would be on. That is a fault most found footage has. But you sort of have to accept that aspect. And then, it sort of gets better as it goes. Not because it's brilliant, but because the performances are rather effective. Scripted dialogue comes out sounding natural and \"the creep\" is just weird enough to be believable and disturbing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H17M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Creep", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2111814169", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY0YzM5OWUtZjcwYi00ODVlLTg2OTgtYjFlODZjOTQ4Y2EzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY0YzM5OWUtZjcwYi00ODVlLTg2OTgtYjFlODZjOTQ4Y2EzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Creep", "uploadDate": "2018-12-05T17:08:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2674307/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Patrick Brice"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2428170/characters/nm2674307?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aaron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0243233/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mark Duplass"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2428170/characters/nm0243233?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Josef"}]}]}

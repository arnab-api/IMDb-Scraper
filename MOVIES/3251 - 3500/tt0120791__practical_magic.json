Nicole Kidman had never been one of my favorite actress either, but I loved her in this movie (as I did Sandra Bullock). The real standouts though were Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest - watching them perform was almost worth the price of admission itself! They are wonderful.\n\nI don't see this movie as being about magic or witchcraft, the romance between Sally and Gary Hallet or even Jimmy Angelov chasing Gillian (which is a huge catalyst - but not really any more than that). For me, this movie is really about the relationships between sisters and women (the Aunts Franny and Jet, Kylie and Antonia, the Owens' women and the townswomen and of course, between Sally and Gillian - both young and adult).\n\nAll of the actresses had a great chemistry, but I couldn't believe how well matched Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman were. I felt that their bond was very believable and I loved watching their relationship to each other (and themselves) grow and mature as they went from being children to adults.\n\nI certainly don't think that this film will appeal to everybody, and I can see why so many people \"don't get it\", but if you watch it more for the relationships between the women and not so much for the romance angle or the magic I think that you will really enjoy this movie. I thought that the romance and magic were handled very well, I just saw them as being secondary to the real story. Also - it has a wonderful soundtrack.\n\nI read the book after seeing the movie, and while there are many changes between the two, I really enjoyed both. I thought that the changes made to the movie made for a better movie overall.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable movie. I highly recommend it."}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Practical Magic", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1837170969", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwMjQ0NDMtNzc1My00ODgyLWJmNGQtYThiYTEzNGMyYjY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwMjQ0NDMtNzc1My00ODgyLWJmNGQtYThiYTEzNGMyYjY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:43:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000113/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sandra Bullock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0000113?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sally Owens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000330/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stockard Channing"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0000330?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Aunt Frances"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0899681/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Goran Visnjic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0899681?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jimmy Angelov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0939697/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Evan Rachel Wood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0939697?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kylie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0275417/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mark Feuerstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0275417?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Michael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0696790/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Annabella Price"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0696790?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lovelorn Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0188202/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lora Anne Criswell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0188202?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gillian @ Age 10"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0916050/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Chloe Webb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0916050?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Carla"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000173/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nicole Kidman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0000173?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gillian Owens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001848/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dianne Wiest"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0001848?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aunt Jet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001644/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aidan Quinn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0001644?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Gary Hallet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0037941/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alexandra Artrip"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0037941?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Antonia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0070691/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Caprice Benedetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0070691?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maria Owens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004741/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Camilla Belle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0004741?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sally @ Age 11"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0553269/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Margo Martindale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0120791/characters/nm0553269?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Linda Bennett"}]}]}

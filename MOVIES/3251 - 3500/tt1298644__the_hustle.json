We need so much now when the movies are of such high quality. The acting was not the issue rather the script they had to work with. There were only a couple of belly laughs, and others that were funny but not hilarious. The setting was fine as well. Some nice views were on show. With comedies they have the opportunity to be ridiculous and far fetched with some superb lines thrown in for effect and to give good actors a chance to shine. A few twists and turns that you cannot see coming also helps. The actors were let down I think. The storyline needed to be more complex. The very best comedies are multi layered and clever. This one lacked all that unfortunately. There was little tugging of the heart strings as well. That can be omitted for a comedy but it helps as well. In depth characterisation was not there either. I did not connect much to any of them. There were a few surprises but I had guessed them or saw them coming. Maybe keep it for a TV movie later on. It is not in the realm of the fine comedies!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "'The Hustle': Official Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2275195929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ0ZmQ4MmEtZjdmNS00ODg0LTlkMjktNDBlNmZlMjc0YmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzQ0ZmQ4MmEtZjdmNS00ODg0LTlkMjktNDBlNmZlMjc0YmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg", "description": "Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson star as female scam artists who aim to take down those who have wronged them.", "uploadDate": "2019-04-22T16:18:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3985937/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Timothy Simons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm3985937?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeremy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7077073/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Douggie McMeekin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm7077073?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0159745/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Casper Christensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm0159745?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mathias"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2060055/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Philip Desmeules"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm2060055?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dealer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7169015/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jarreau Antoine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm7169015?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bartender"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940245/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nicholas Woodeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm0940245?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Albert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0214860/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Raffaello Degruttola"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm0214860?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Fancy Euro Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3781350/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Guy Warren-Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm3781350?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Train Attendant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2313103/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rebel Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm2313103?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Penny Rust"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1371443/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ashley McGuire"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm1371443?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Policewoman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1642065/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Eloise Lovell Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm1642065?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Beautiful Woman (Casino)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2028298/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ingrid Oliver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm2028298?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Brigitte Desjardins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004266/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Anne Hathaway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm0004266?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Josephine Chesterfield"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4343603/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Celine Abrahams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm4343603?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cashier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3820497/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alex Gaumond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1298644/characters/nm3820497?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Waiter"}]}]}

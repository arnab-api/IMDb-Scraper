Ever since 1964, it seemed like nothing could top Dr. Strangelove. A lot of movies have tried and a lot have failed, although there were the lucky few that passed the bar (Election, Thank You for Smoking) but the brilliant thing about In The Loop is that it's so stupidly funny that it's one of the best comedies of the 21st Century! Armando Iannucci, most known for his The Thick of It series in the UK, directs a movie with the a the familiar theme of The Office. That documentary-style of film-making can be hit-or-miss (most recently, Public Enemies, a miss) and Iannucci hits it right on. Every scene he graces with a camera comes out picture perfect; nobody could've pegged this movie any better. Iannucci, Jesse Armstrong, Tony Roche and Simon Blackwell's script is something out of picture show heaven and sounds like it must've taken forever to finish, edit, revise, etc. Although these guys, these geniuses, apparently know what they're doing and don't care what anybody else says. That is the heart and soul of movie-making, readers. In The Loop is about a corrupt British government that accidentally gets the country thrown into the middle of a war. Loop stars Peter Capaldi, Gina McKee, James Gandolfini, Chris Addison and there's even a whimsical cameo by Steve Coogan. Capaldi is the absolute best at what he did, spewing swears as coarse as they are a riot (\"fuck you, you lubricated horse cock!\") and freaking out. I can't even put into words just how funny this guy was; he made the movie! But don't forget Addison as Toby. Addison is the British Napoleon Dynamite, that incredibly awkward guy that makes even the audience members turn red. James Gandolfini and Gina McKee round out the rest of the cast greatly, filling In The Loop with the type of sexual tension that you don't want to think about. It's like when a sex scene pops up on a DVD you're watching with your parents. Yeah, that bad.In The Loop is one of the most laugh out loud comedies I've seen in the past decade, that sadly nobody will get a chance to watch. In a world of Transformers and G.I Joe, In The Loop will sadly be ignored. But on an optimistic note, we may have found this summer's sleeper, America.\n\n5/5 stars.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "In the Loop -- Trailer #2 (U.S.)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4170449433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NTY4MjIzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAxNzc1Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NTY4MjIzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAxNzc1Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the Dr. Strangelove-inspired theatrical trailer for In the Loop.", "uploadDate": "2009-05-21T08:54:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0134922/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Peter Capaldi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0134922?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Malcolm Tucker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2803086/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Samantha Harrington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm2803086?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Malcolm's Secretary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390903/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tom Hollander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0390903?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Simon Foster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1128050/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chris Addison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm1128050?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Toby Wright"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2046855/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Zach Woods"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm2046855?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001043/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Anna Chlumsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0001043?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Liza Weld"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1176400/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lucinda Raikes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm1176400?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Reporter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0711058/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "David Rasche"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0711058?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Linton Barwick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2227000/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Harry Hadden-Paton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm2227000?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Civil Servant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0571160/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gina McKee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0571160?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Judy Molloy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1214783/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Olivia Poulet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm1214783?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Suzy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0808576/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0808576?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Michael Rodgers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0448252/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mimi Kennedy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0448252?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Karen Clark"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0162281/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Enzo Cilenti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0162281?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bob Adriano"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230577/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "James Doherty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1226774/characters/nm0230577?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Reporter"}]}]}

I stopped playing very soon because, in truth, not a whole lot was happening. It was mostly an uncomfortable experience, eerily lit and hauntingly scored. I could feel an intense build-up in that foggy place but I never reached the culmination, so I gave up. OK, fine - I was scared.\n\nYears later this film adaptation is bravely made by Christophe Gans and, even though I'd played less than ten minutes of the game, I immediately recognised the haunting visuals of the abandoned city. So 'well done' here is an understatement. It is superbly breathed new life into.\n\nThe plot has been glossed over slightly in a Hollywood fashion, but captures the essence of its characters and storyline - which is: as a last resort, a mother takes her ill daughter to a place she often mentions in her sleep - a place near where she was adopted from. But the hope the mother has for her daughter's recovery quickly shatters and turns into despair when the little girl vanishes in the misty mysterious old town.\n\nI truly cannot credit the atmosphere of this film enough. Christophe Gans has successfully captured the eerie mood of Silent Hill and it is a nightmarish place - a fog-enshrouded hell that shifts between two modes: barren ashen daylight and a gruesome decaying state with fiery ember, demons and enhanced by chilling (and very sudden) sound effects. It's strangely fascinating, surreal and above all frightening.\n\nThe problems of Silent Hill (2006) are that there are not nearly enough build-ups. They should have been used not only to stay faithful to the video game upon which it was based but to wield tension in the right way and shock us when the build-up finally culminates. But here we are introduced to horrid creatures early on and often without much foreshadowing devices. Because they are presented to us so generously and clear-viewed, they are not that scary. At all. Some even manage a raised eyebrow, like the crawly CGI cripples.\n\nIn the end, I think this is quality horror entertainment and probably one of the better game-to-film adaptations, abut it is much too chaotic - too many monsters and too often and too clearly to be frightening. The mood and atmosphere are what is frightening and so it should have been used even more in Silent Hill, but instead the director feels pressured to introduce creatures to satisfy mainstream audiences' need for bloody gorefest and kinetic action.\n\n7 out of 10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Silent Hill", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi797442329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZlMjZkNWMtY2NmYy00N2MxLWEyNjgtOTA0NDMzNzllNWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWZlMjZkNWMtY2NmYy00N2MxLWEyNjgtOTA0NDMzNzllNWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:06:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0593664/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Radha Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0593664?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rose Da Silva"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390229/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laurie Holden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0390229?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cybil Bennett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0167649/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kim Coates"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0167649?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Officer Thomas Gucci"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000481/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alice Krige"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0000481?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Christabella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930306/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Colleen Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0930306?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Archivist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186763/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Eve Crawford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0186763?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sister Margaret"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2212938/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Amanda Hiebert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm2212938?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gas Attendant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0241675/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Maxine Dumont"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0241675?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Christabella's Aide"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000293/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sean Bean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0000293?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christopher Da Silva"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000679/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Deborah Kara Unger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0000679?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dahlia Gillespie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0021091/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tanya Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0021091?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272706/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jodelle Ferland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0272706?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sharon"}, {"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0272706?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Alessa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0300277/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ron Gabriel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0300277?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Old Mechanic"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0728675/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Derek Ritschel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0728675?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Young Police Officer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0309914/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nicky Guadagni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384537/characters/nm0309914?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Distressed Woman"}]}]}

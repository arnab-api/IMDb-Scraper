First Off I'm not A Seth McFarlane Fan. I don't like Family Guy and I Thought Ted was Childish.( But I am over 40) So when I read the reviews on here I had to go and see this movie for myself. Nothing could be that bad (I thought): And I was right. There is nothing wrong with this Movie. Its never going to win an award but I don't imagine they thought it would. Its funny, the characters are likable and the actors are excellent.\n\nIt would appear that somebody wrote a bad review on here and as usual, The Sheep jumped on The band Wagon.\n\nThis is as good a comedy as any I've seen in the last few years and better than a lot I've seen in the last ten years. The story was good and kept me entertained throughout the Movie. It was crude in places but its Seth McFarlane Folks ! What did you expect?.\n\nI was glad I went to see this and came out with a smile on my face. I understand that maybe Ted was aimed at an age group a lot younger than me, but I just didn't like it. However, I did like this movie. As I said at the start, don't follow The Sheep. Give this a go and you wont be disappointed.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2623188249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NTQ3NDUzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwNjkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NTQ3NDUzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwNjkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "As a cowardly farmer begins to fall for the mysterious new woman in town, he must put his new-found courage to the test when her husband, a notorious gun-slinger, announces his arrival.", "uploadDate": "2014-06-03T10:52:20Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0532235/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Seth MacFarlane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0532235?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Albert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1086543/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Amanda Seyfried"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm1086543?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Louise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000610/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Giovanni Ribisi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0000610?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Edward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0798971/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sarah Silverman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0798971?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ruth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0836071/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Wes Studi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0836071?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cochise"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428055/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Evan Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0428055?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lewis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0513010/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rex Linn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0513010?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sheriff"}, {"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0513010?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Narrator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0097504/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Alex Borstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0097504?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Millie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000234/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Charlize Theron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0000234?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Anna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000553/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Liam Neeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0000553?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Clinch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000439/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Neil Patrick Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0000439?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Foy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2474652/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Christopher Hagen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm2474652?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "George Stark"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164273/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Matt Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0164273?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Old Prospector"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0574197/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Aaron McPherson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0574197?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0725434/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Brett Rickaby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2557490/characters/nm0725434?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Charlie Blanche"}]}]}

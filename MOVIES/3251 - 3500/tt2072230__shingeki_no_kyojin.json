This would be acceptable if the new plot follows the same core, far from that the characters and world here feel inferior, they are almost unrecognizable if not for the cosmetic. Its biggest strength is the gore, it's a viable action with a lick of horror when it gets momentum.\n\nHumanity has a grim reminder that they live in fear of Titans, or so the opening says. The film focuses on a group of youngster trying to fend off Titans with Spider-Man cosplay tool. Right from the opening act, it doesn't follow the plot of manga. To be fair, it would have been okay if it worked. I'm not a fan and changes are expected, but in this case, it ruins both the new rendition and might even offend the fans.\n\nSetting takes a drastic turns, both the time and place are entirely different. Character development feels watered down. Stripped from their traits, these guys and girls look like generic anime protagonist, while in manga they at least have distinct features. This rings especially true with the lead Eren and Mikasa who only bear the same name yet without any real charm.\n\nThe new additional characters as well as the portrayal of existing ones are choppy at best. Probably only a few of the scenes with humans actually have the same level of humor or tone. Effects don't really capture the agile motion, although the Titans do appear menacing. They look creepy enough with all the smirk and blood, which the show used in abundance. These Titans are bleeders.\n\nIt's uncertain what this live action tries to accomplish, its major demographic is definitely the fans, yet the significant change will turn them off. It may appeal to general audience as an action flick, although with lesser plot it's merely passable as monster movie with slightly nifty gimmick.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi780120857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMzgxMjE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjgyMjM5NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMzgxMjE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjgyMjM5NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The story of a world where most of humanity has been destroyed by giants and where the last of mankind fights to survive behind three concentric walls - walls that were once impenetrable to the giants.", "uploadDate": "2015-10-01T09:38:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2067218/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Haruma Miura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm2067218?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eren"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1959800/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kanata Hong\u00f4"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm1959800?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Armin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3142576/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nanami Sakuraba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm3142576?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sasha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4056296/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hiroki Hasegawa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm4056296?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Shikishima"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0847651/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Pierre Taki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm0847651?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Souda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4285227/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Shu Watanabe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm4285227?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Fukushi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3390879/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rina Takeda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm3390879?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10519522/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Takur\u00f4 Kodama"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3460467/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kiko Mizuhara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm3460467?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mikasa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1595000/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Satomi Ishihara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm1595000?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hange"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3627424/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Takahiro Miura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm3627424?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2799623/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ayame Misaki"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm2799623?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hiana"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0475165/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jun Kunimura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm0475165?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kubal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2865407/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Satoru Matsuo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm2865407?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sannagi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2950459/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Yutaka Mishima"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2072230/characters/nm2950459?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Titan of joy"}]}]}

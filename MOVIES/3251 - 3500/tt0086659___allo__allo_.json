It was funny but never THAT funny, or at least so I thought, because when I got into my twenties and the show vanished from Norwegian television - low and behold - I went and ordered the 3 first seasons of the internet! So I guess I was more addicted to it than I cared to admit at first :)\n\nThe basic idea of making fun of Nazis never seem to grow old, or in the case of this show: making fun of the Gestapo. The rest of the Germans come off as almost sympathetic and lovable at times, but I mean: how can anyone hate the closet-gay officer Lt. Gruber and his \"little tank\"? The show is really classic comedy, especially in the way that much of the laughs rely heavily on the fun of repeated catchphrases (\"It is I, Leclerc!\" - \"Good moaning!\" \"Listen carefully, I shall say this only once\" etc) and some truly crazy antics. It IS at times *very* funny and some of the goings-on in this German occupied French village really has to be seen to be believed!\n\nOne of my favorite characters is Officer Crabtree, a British undercover-agent posing as a French police-officer, which is quite impressive considering his French makes Inspector Closeau sound like a professor in linguistics. One of his lines that has followed me since I was about 14 was \"The French pissants are hiding in the German shiteu\" (you figure it out).\n\nSo there you have it, if you like the subject of WWII and British comedy \"Allo Allo\" should be your 'cap of toe' (as Officer Crabtree probably would call it).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0443313/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gorden Kaye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086659/characters/nm0443313?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ren\u00e9 Artois"}, {"url": "#", "name": "85 episodes, 1982-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0585053/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vicki Michelle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086659/characters/nm0585053?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Yvette Carte-Blanche"}, {"url": "#", "name": "85 episodes, 1982-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0366983/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kim Hartman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086659/characters/nm0366983?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Private Helga Geerhart"}, {"url": "#", "name": "85 episodes, 1982-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177457/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kirsten Cooke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086659/characters/nm0177457?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michelle Dubois"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 1982-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0384641/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rose Hill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086659/characters/nm0384641?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Madame Fanny"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 1982-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0172412/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John D.

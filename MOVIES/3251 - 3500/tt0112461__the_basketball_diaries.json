I mean, the story is always the same: a guy begins having drugs for fun, or because he's boring, or just because he's young and wants to try new experiences, then he gets hooked, starts to rob or to prostitute himself, and eventually ends up in prison. That's what we see in Christiane F., El Pico, Trainspotting, Drugstore Cowboy... There may be differences in the form, and in the characters, but the content is always the same. \n\nThe dinstictive feature of Basketball Diaries is that the main character actually exists: Jim Carroll, a writer-singer-performer born in NYC in the 50's. And this is supposed to be his autobiography (or the cinema adaptation of some diaries he wrote when he was a teenager, heroin-addicted). Because of that, Basketball D. is more poetic than the rest of the movies I named before, the voice over of DiCaprio's character is present all along the film, telling us about his thoughts (rather nihilistic's) , with a style near to Burroughs or Jack Kerouac, urban poetry, tough and without ornament. Maybe that's the strong point of Basketball Diaries, because movies such as Christiane F. or El Pico recreates much better what it means to be a drug-addict, they're much more explicit, more dirty, much harder...\n\n DiCaprio's performance deserves a new paragraph, 'cause it's simply astonishing. His best performance EVER, plenty of different shades. As he did in Gilbert Grape or This Boy's Life, he shows us how versatile he can be. If only he'd choose better the films he works in. \n\nMy rate: 7/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Basketball Diaries", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi378470681", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUxMjI1ZWQtYTRjNy00ZmU1LWEyYWUtMTZhZWQ2MmQ4NjZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUxMjI1ZWQtYTRjNy00ZmU1LWEyYWUtMTZhZWQ2MmQ4NjZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Basketball Diaries", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:31:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000138/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0000138?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Carroll"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0812427/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Marilyn Sokol"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0812427?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chanting Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0569011/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patrick McGaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0569011?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Neutron"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0178358/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Roy Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0178358?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Father McNulty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0456124/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bruno Kirby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0456124?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Swifty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0300674/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nick Gaetani"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0300674?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Referee #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0430355/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ben Jorgensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0430355?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tommy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000496/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Juliette Lewis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0000496?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Diane Moody"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000966/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lorraine Bracco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0000966?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jim's Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534944/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James Madio"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0534944?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Pedro"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000242/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mark Wahlberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0000242?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mickey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0665114/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Vincent Pastore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0665114?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Construction Worker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0660493/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jimmy Papiris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0660493?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Iggy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0300040/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Alexander Chaplin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0300040?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bobo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0609215/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Josh Mostel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112461/characters/nm0609215?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Counterman"}]}]}

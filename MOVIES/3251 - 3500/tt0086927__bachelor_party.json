It features Tom Hanks in an early comical movie role and it actually is sort of a shame he doesn't do movies like this anymore, since he certainly was very talented at it. Not that I mind the movies that he does now days of course but it at the same time is also a waste of his comical talent.\n\nThe movie also tries to feature some more serious elements, that concentrated on what it means to be married. Not that this works out horrible for the movie but it of course is also distracting a bit from what the movie is really truly about; simple immature comedy. Further more there is very little story actually and it simply features on the events during and around a bachelor party.\n\nThe movie is so silly, simplistic and immature that you just can't help being entertained by it all. No matter how bad and cheesy it all gets, you can't help laughing at this movie. Some comical moments are just plain great.\n\nA real enjoyable silly '80's comedy, starring a young Tom Hanks.\n\n7/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4018060825", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI2OTE4ZTYtNmY1Ny00YzAxLTkzMWQtNjMwMGQzY2ExZjEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI2OTE4ZTYtNmY1Ny00YzAxLTkzMWQtNjMwMGQzY2ExZjEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A soon-to-be-married man's (Tom Hanks) friends throw him the ultimate bachelor party.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-28T22:59:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000158/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Hanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0000158?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rick Gassko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0957460/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Adrian Zmed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0957460?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jay O'Neill"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0835651/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Barbara Stuart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0835651?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mrs. Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0855335/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "William Tepper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0855335?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dr. Stan Gassko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0224588/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Barry Diamond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0224588?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rudy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001154/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Michael Dudikoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0001154?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ryko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0277433/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Martina Finch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0277433?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Phoebe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0810212/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tracy Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0810212?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bobbi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000478/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tawny Kitaen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0000478?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Debbie Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342732/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "George Grizzard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0342732?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ed Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0696127/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Robert Prescott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0696127?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cole Whittier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818274/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wendie Jo Sperber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0818274?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Tina Gassko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0343643/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gary Grossman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0343643?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0051620/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bradford Bancroft"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0051620?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brad Mollen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0363493/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Deborah Harmon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086927/characters/nm0363493?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ilene"}]}]}

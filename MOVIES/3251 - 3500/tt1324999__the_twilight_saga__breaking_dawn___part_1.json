Obviously a 32-year-old male isn't the target viewer for this film but I must admit that it was a major step up from the previous two installments. I might even go as far to say that this here was the best of the series in a bad way. I say that because I'm sure teenage girls will be weeping all over themselves through the first hour of this thing but, as an adult, I couldn't help but laugh at it. The first hour deals with the screen's most popular duo getting married and of course the girl losing her virginity. I know this is a big thing to Twi-hards and teenage girls but the execution here is just laughable and especially the moments leading up to the act. The entire thing is just directed so over-dramatic that I couldn't help but laugh. It also didn't help that the dialogue was just downright awful and at times embarrassing. With that said, these bad moments actually make the film rather entertaining. Both Pattinson and Stewart are pros at these characters by now and it's also clear that Lautner continues to work out and this must cause him to skip his acting classes. As usual the CGI is pretty bad but I guess this is to be expected. Still, I found the story to be rather compelling and the entire thing kept me entertained from start to finish. Yes it drags on too long but you have to admit there's some pretty weird stuff going on here and especially during the second half."}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2052299801", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NDE0MzU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc4Nzc2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2NDE0MzU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc4Nzc2Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Quileute and the Volturi close in on expecting parents Edward and Bella, whose unborn child poses different threats to the wolf pack and vampire coven.", "uploadDate": "2011-09-15T13:33:52Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1210124/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Taylor Lautner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm1210124?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jacob Black"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0121605/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Billy Burke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm0121605?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charlie Swan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0648153/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ty Olsson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm0648153?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Phil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2230865/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ashley Greene"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm2230865?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alice Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004906/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Peter Facinelli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm0004906?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dr. Carlisle Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1553725/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kellan Lutz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm1553725?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Emmett Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1500155/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Robert Pattinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm1500155?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Edward Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2101229/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "James Pizzinato"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm2101229?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Unsavory Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0083655/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gil Birmingham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm0083655?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Billy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1020124/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sarah Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm1020124?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Renee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829576/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kristen Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm0829576?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bella Swan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1717152/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jackson Rathbone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm1717152?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jasper Hale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0714147/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Elizabeth Reaser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm0714147?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Esme Cullen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1223023/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nikki Reed"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm1223023?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rosalie Hale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2315589/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Christian Sloan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1324999/characters/nm2315589?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Unsavory Man"}]}]}

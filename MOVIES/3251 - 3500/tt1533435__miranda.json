Miranda handles everything with humor and makes lemonade with all the lemons she is dealt. All the day to day troubles we all have are dealt with such humor, that you realize how unimportant they are. The casting is wonderful. \n\nI have enjoyed everything I have every seen Miranda Hart in. Patricia Hodge is funny and irreverent as Miranda's mother, who tries to marry her off at every turn. The friendship between Miranda, Stevie (Sarah Hadland) and Tilly (Sally Phillips) is \"bear with...bear with\" hysterical. Tom Ellis performance as Gary makes all us tall, plus- sized women hopeful. He is charming, funny and (of course) handsome as ever!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1635000/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Miranda Hart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1533435/characters/nm1635000?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Miranda"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2009-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0255124/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tom Ellis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1533435/characters/nm0255124?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gary Preston"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2009-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0680766/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sally Phillips"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1533435/characters/nm0680766?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tilly"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 2009-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388092/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Patricia Hodge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1533435/characters/nm0388092?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Penny"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 2009-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352864/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sarah Hadland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1533435/characters/nm0352864?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Stevie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "19 episodes, 2009-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0391866/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "James Holmes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1533435/characters/nm0391866?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Clive"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2009-2015"}]}]}

I worried about Mr. Hanks return to \"light comedy\" as this is the arena where he made the transition from TV to film- remember \"Big\"? Well, \"Charlie Wilson's War\" is not light comedy. It is political satire, and extremely well-written political satire at that. The script is the star of this film, and the word-smithing by Aaron Sorkin is some of the best on offer this year.\n\nMike Nicols holds the entire escapade together, delivering a film that zips along in a very quick 90 minutes (timing is everything in comedy, and nothing is ever funny if it drags). Nicols' choice in sets and lighting are also very reminiscent of '70's and '80's TV, a move used deliberately to root the piece in period.\n\nThe return to the use of model work and stock photography over digital special effects also enhances the retro look and believability. Note to the production designers in your choice of stock footage: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG, and a Bell and a Hind. But that may have been part of the joke, too.\n\nI saw this film in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the audience NOT get the historical references to their own history. History tends to repeat because the recidivists have forgotten what happened the first time around.\n\nKudos to both Mr. Hanks and that chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman. Sorkin's script is brought to life by these actors, and the entire production team is on the top of their game.\n\nHeartily recommended.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Charlie Wilson's War", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi95551769", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODU2MjA1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMzNzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODU2MjA1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMzNzgyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Charlie Wilson's War Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-12-01T10:20:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000158/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Hanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0000158?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlie Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000210/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julia Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0000210?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joanne Herring"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0102462/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Terry Bozeman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0102462?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "CIA Award Presenter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0878954/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jud Tylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0878954?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Crystal Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0061347/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cyia Batten"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0061347?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stacey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0716628/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ed Regine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0716628?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Limo Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1289434/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Emily Blunt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm1289434?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jane Liddle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1570774/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Wynn Everett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm1570774?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Receptionist - Charlie's Angels"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0010736/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Amy Adams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0010736?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bonnie Bach"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000450/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Philip Seymour Hoffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0000450?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gust Avrakotos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0548498/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brian Markinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0548498?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paul Brown"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0759350/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hilary Angelo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0759350?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kelly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0593510/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kirby Mitchell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0593510?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stoned Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1896045/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Daniel Eric Gold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm1896045?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Donnelly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0314253/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter Gerety"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0472062/characters/nm0314253?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Larry Liddle"}]}]}

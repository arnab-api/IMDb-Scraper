However, Eckhart's acting is a bit over the top sometimes that it almost comes across as a cheesy B-movie, especially the shots when it's zooming out from his face when he's having flashbacks or waking up.\n\nThe story itself was quite predictable, at about the halfway point you can hazard a guess about the main character, although they don't explain much in the movie. At times I found this movie a bit boring and slow despite it being only 90mins.\n\nSome of the shots and the sequencing also weren't enjoyable either as it was just all over the place much like the story. I also wasn't a fan of the ending. When it all happened I didn't feel any emotion for the character at all other than being glad the movie was over.\n\nFinally, this was just a small nitpicking thing, but if you are paranoid like the main character and afraid of being spied on that you are constantly changing your phone SIM card, you definitely would not plug a random usb stick into your laptop that has been mysteriously slipped through your door.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi870695193", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWYzNDI3MWQtN2E2NS00NWE5LTlkYzYtMTUzZTNjOTVkNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWYzNDI3MWQtN2E2NS00NWE5LTlkYzYtMTUzZTNjOTVkNTgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After getting hired to probe a suspicious death in the small town of Wander, a mentally unstable private investigator becomes convinced the case is linked to the same 'conspiracy cover up' that caused the death of his daughter.", "uploadDate": "2020-10-23T17:30:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001173/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aaron Eckhart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm0001173?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Arthur Bretnik"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935395/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Katheryn Winnick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm0935395?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Elsa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0190441/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Raymond Cruz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm0190441?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sherif Luis Santiago"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10802681/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Roger Dorman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm10802681?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Leiland"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12136451/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tylannie Smith-Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm12136451?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cleo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0316930/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David Gibson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm0316930?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Canton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9355036/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sheryl Bailey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm9355036?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Alice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10123310/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Elizabeth Selby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm10123310?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Zoe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000169/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tommy Lee Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm0000169?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jimmy Cleats"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001287/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Heather Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm0001287?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shelley Luscomb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0270451/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brendan Fehr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm0270451?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1490478/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nicole Steinwedell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm1490478?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tanya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0154543/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Deborah Chavez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm0154543?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Elena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6131361/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Alaina Warren Zachary"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm6131361?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Glenda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3382898/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ian McLaren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9689696/characters/nm3382898?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Caleb"}]}]}

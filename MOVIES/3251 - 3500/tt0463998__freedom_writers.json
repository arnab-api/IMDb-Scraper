I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture \"\u0085explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life.\" Heartland gave that award to this film.\n\nWoodrow Wilson High School is located in Long Beach, California. The school is voluntarily integrated, and it isn't working. The Asians, the Blacks, the Latinos, and a very few whites not only don't get along, but also stay with their own and are part of protective and violent gangs. There isn't much teaching or learning going on at the school. It is a warehouse for young teenagers until they can drop out or are kicked out.\n\nWith this background, an idealistic teacher (Hilary Swank) arrives to teach Freshmen English. She is very educated, pretty, middle class, non-ethnic, well-dressed, and smart. From day one, she doesn't fit in the classroom with these tough kids, and she doesn't fit in with the faculty, who have all but given up and resigned themselves to being the keepers of the student warehouse.\n\nBut our idealistic teacher will not give up. She slowly and painfully tries to teach by first learning about \"\u0085the pain\u0085\" the students feel. She encourages each of her students to keep a journal of their painful and difficult life, and then to share the journal with her. She also attempts to get the four ethnic groups to come together by getting them to recognize what they have in common; specifically, their music, their movies, their broken families, and their broken community surroundings.\n\nWhile struggling with the students, she has to deal at the same time with two complicated and demanding male relationships. Her husband (Patrick Dempsey) is often supportive, but often jealous of her time commitments. Her father (Scott Glenn) is often disappointed of her career choice, but often proud of her courage and tenacity.\n\nThis story feels real. It is beautifully done. The acting of Swank, Dempsey and Glenn is professional and believable. More importantly the story highlights our society's challenges in schooling the children of poor and one-parent families. \n\nThe movie doesn't give miracle answers. But it does give hope. And in the end, sincere effort appears to count for something \u0085 maybe everything.\n\nFYI \u0096 There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Freedom Writers", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3634888985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThhNGI5NzAtYjBiNC00YjA0LWI4ZTktZjIxYTY0ZWY1NWQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThhNGI5NzAtYjBiNC00YjA0LWI4ZTktZjIxYTY0ZWY1NWQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Paramount", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:13:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005476/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hilary Swank"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm0005476?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Erin Gruwell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001277/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Scott Glenn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm0001277?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Steve Gruwell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1571820/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "April Hernandez Castillo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm1571820?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eva Benitez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1660076/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kristin Herrera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm1660076?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gloria Munez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2474618/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sergio Montalvo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm2474618?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alejandro Santiago"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1507444/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Deance Wyatt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm1507444?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jamal Hill"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2474632/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gabriel Chavarria"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm2474632?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tito"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2474636/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Antonio Garc\u00eda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm2474636?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Miguel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001131/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Patrick Dempsey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm0001131?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Scott Casey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001767/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Imelda Staunton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm0001767?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Margaret Campbell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1276562/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mario"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm1276562?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Andre Bryant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2474638/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jaclyn Ngan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm2474638?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sindy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2472309/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jason Finn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm2472309?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Marcus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1856481/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Vanetta Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm1856481?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brandy Ross"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1446060/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hunter Parrish"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0463998/characters/nm1446060?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ben Daniels"}]}]}

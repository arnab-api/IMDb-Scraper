No good plot, bad cgi, rushed scenes etc. Only thing I found good was the action. An R rating didn't help this one at all. It almost seems like they tried to make this PG-13 at first, but then changed it to R later because fans were complaining about Live Free or Die Hard's (Aka Die Hard 4.0)'s rating. The movie has PG-13 / 12A violence, and this is disappointing. John Moore could of done so much more with this film, but instead, he messes it up just like he did with Max Payne. Good action, but no good story or character development. \n\nJai Courtney (who starred in Jack Reacher earlier this year) did well on his part, and I do hope he returns if they are making a 6th one, but I am begging, please get a good director for the 6th one, since Bruce says it will possibly be the last one. Bring McTiernan back, and let him end the series with a huge bang! I am sorry to say this, but the film was not good at all. Being an hard-core Die Hard fan, I suggest that other fans should just let this one pass.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1541121817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTExMjg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUyMzE5OA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTExMjg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUyMzE5OA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "John McClane travels to Russia to help out his seemingly wayward son, Jack, only to discover that Jack is a CIA operative working to prevent a nuclear-weapons heist, causing the father and son to team up against underworld forces.", "uploadDate": "2013-01-05T10:38:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1606378/characters/nm0000246?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John McClane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0462407/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sebastian Koch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1606378/characters/nm0462407?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Komarov"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2568364/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Yulia Snigir"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1606378/characters/nm2568364?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Irina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0369513/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cole Hauser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1606378/characters/nm0369513?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Collins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0464038/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sergey Kolesnikov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1606378/characters/nm0464038?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chagarin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0304652/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Zolee Ganxsta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1606378/characters/nm0304652?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "MRAP Driver"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0527945/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Pasha D.

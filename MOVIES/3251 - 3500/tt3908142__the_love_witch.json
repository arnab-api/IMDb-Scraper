As the movie opens, we see Elaine, in a bright red dress, driving her bright red Mustang convertible, on her way to a friend's apartment (turns out Elaine's luggage is also bright red). It's not long before we realize that after Elaine's husband Jerry left her \"I died but then I was reborn as a witch\", and now Elaine uses love potions in her quest to attract Mr. Charming. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately for us the viewers), these love potions are at times too strong. At this point we are not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is nothing short of a labor of love from Anna Biller, who previously brought us \"Viva\". Let me count the ways: Biller writes, produces, directs, designs the costumes and set, and composes the original score for this. So yes, this is an \"Anna Biller Production\" from A to Z. Here Biller uses witchcraft and femininity to bring a visually rich, even at times over-stimulating, story about \"women empowerment\". Even though the movie is set in today, the movie's tone, style and overall vibe is deeply rooted in the 60s. The photography's color palette is deeply striking as well, where bright colors are jumping at you. I must admit that during the first 20-15 min., it all seemed like a giant pastiche or send-up of 1960s movies (not unlike the Austin Powers movies), but once you get beyond the initial surprise, the movie actually settles and is far deeper than just a joke or a send-up (even if you'll find that plentiful in the movie of course). Special kudos to Ms, Biller for the exquisite set designs, in particular keeping in mind this movie was made for a nickel and a dime (certainly by Hollywood standards). My comments would be incomplete without mentioning the outstanding performance by Samantha Robinson (whom I was not familiar with before this) in the title role. Beware: there is quite a bit of nudity in the film, so if that bothers you, you may wish to stay away from this movie. Bottom line: I can honestly tell you that this movie is one of the more unique films I've seen this year, but \"The Love Witch\" delivers, and then some.\n\nI had seen the trailer for this, and recently \"The Love Witch\" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 10 people altogether), but those who were there clearly enjoyed it quite a bit, with frequent laughing and hollering (especially from the women in the audience!). If you are in the mood for a truly unique film that is \"way out there\", if not beyond that, I might suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"The Love Witch\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Love Witch", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi814593817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExMjk1Mzg1MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA1MjM0Mzkx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExMjk1Mzg1MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA1MjM0Mzkx._V1_.jpg", "description": "A modern-day witch uses spells and magic to get men to fall in love with her, in a tribute to 1960s Technicolor melodramas.", "uploadDate": "2016-07-04T03:58:41Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6231136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Samantha Robinson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm6231136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elaine Parks"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3731645/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Waddell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm3731645?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Trish"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1239627/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jared Sanford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm1239627?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gahan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1912054/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jennifer Ingrum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm1912054?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Barbara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1599755/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Clive Ashborn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm1599755?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Professor King"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2444393/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jennifer Couch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm2444393?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Wendy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5672668/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Giselle DaMier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm5672668?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Harpist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4752515/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Elle Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm4752515?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Star"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1323275/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gian Keys"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm1323275?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Griff Meadows"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0661651/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jeffrey Vincent Parise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm0661651?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wayne Peters"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0781571/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Robert Seeley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm0781571?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Richard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0263141/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Randy Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm0263141?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Steve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1972813/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lily Holleman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm1972813?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Miss Curtis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0941966/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Stephen Wozniak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm0941966?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jerry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7195426/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "April Showers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3908142/characters/nm7195426?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "April Showers"}]}]}

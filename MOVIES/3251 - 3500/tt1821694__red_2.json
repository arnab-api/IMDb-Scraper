It's a lot of fun, simple as that, the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves and because of that I had a fun time watching it, it's a lot funnier than the original, does not take itself as seriously, much lighter on character development. The story is very simple and straight forward, but a star studded cast that includes Bruce Willis, John Malcovich, Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins make this a very enjoyable two hours. I did feel the story was really lacking in depth, it just seems to move along piece by piece, no moment is really significant or gratifying for the audience, it never tried to make this sequel stand out on its own. I did not enjoy the love issues which erupt between Frank and Sarah as a result of Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, it all felt very forced and created an annoying persona for Mary Louise Parker, making her nowhere near as cool as or likable as she was in the original, she was a strong character then, here she is simply a love interest. It certainly has its flaws but Red 2 mostly makes up for it with its pure fun and optimistic cast, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. \n\nA retired secret agent and his girlfriend get dragged in to a race to find a nuclear bomb. \n\nBest Performance: Anthony Hopkins", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "UK Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3200493849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjIwMjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzODMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MjIwMjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzODMyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device.", "uploadDate": "2013-08-01T07:26:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0000246?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frank"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000571/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mary-Louise Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0000571?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sarah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000164/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anthony Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0000164?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bailey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5797724/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jong Kun Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm5797724?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Han's Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0568180/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Neal McDonough"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0568180?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jack Horton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0353796/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Garrick Hagon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0353796?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Davis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004051/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Brian Cox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0004051?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ivan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1659086/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mitchell Mullen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm1659086?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Wade"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000518/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Malkovich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0000518?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marvin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000545/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Helen Mirren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0000545?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Victoria"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496932/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lee Byung-Hun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0496932?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Han Cho Bai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001876/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Catherine Zeta-Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0001876?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Katja"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000667/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "David Thewlis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0000667?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "The Frog"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0683116/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tim Pigott-Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm0683116?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Director Philips"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1787364/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Philip Arditti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1821694/characters/nm1787364?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Arman"}]}]}

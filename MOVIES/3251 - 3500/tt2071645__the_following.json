Although some may complain that it moves by a little too fast(which I admit at times it did), that's only a small qualm as the performances and main plot make up for it with various twists and turns throughout the story. Kevin Bacon was simply incredible as the worn down FBI agent with a tragic past that has yet to be explored further as the show progresses, but James Purefoy is MARVELOUS as the twisted serial killer. With his manic stare and smile, you're not really sure as to his true motives. This makes him more dimensional yet at the same time diabolically and devilishly sinister; playing mind games with the protagonist with his schemes of mass murder and mayhem. Purefoy is a beast of a man that no one wants to mess with.\n\n\"The Following\" is one to watch. I'll be tuning in to the next episode to see how twisted and horrifying the world will be in the eyes of the hero and villain in a battle against good and evil. If the quality of this show keeps up, I'd expect more seasons.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Following: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi7186713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWY2NzY3NzAtODhiNC00NDk1LWE0YzEtMmU4YmEyMjU1MGU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWY2NzY3NzAtODhiNC00NDk1LWE0YzEtMmU4YmEyMjU1MGU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Follwing: The Complete First Season", "uploadDate": "2013-09-14T05:06:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000102/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Bacon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2071645/characters/nm0000102?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Hardy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "45 episodes, 2013-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0700856/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Purefoy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2071645/characters/nm0700856?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joe Carroll"}, {"url": "#", "name": "45 episodes, 2013-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1888211/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jessica Stroup"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2071645/characters/nm1888211?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Max Hardy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0954036/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Natalie Zea"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2071645/characters/nm0954036?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Claire Matthews"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2013-2014"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0039162/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Shawn Ashmore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2071645/characters/nm0039162?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mike Weston"}, {"url": "#", "name": "45 episodes, 2013-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3862996/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sam Underwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2071645/characters/nm3862996?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mark"}, {"url": "#", "name": "30 episodes, 2014-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2038170/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Valorie Curry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2071645/characters/nm2038170?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Emma Hill"}, {"url": "#", "name": "29 episodes, 2013-2014"}]}]}

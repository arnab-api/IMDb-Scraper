You may not understand what I mean by that but I'll explain.\n\nI am pretty young (15 yrs. old) but mature to some my age! I love \"love stories\". And on average now you usually see the young/beautiful (in some ppl's opinions) people in love movies! And to see Diane & Jack play these roles.. and basically show that even when you are at that age how devine it is :) In my opinion I think Diane is beautiful also. My point is: I really enjoy seeing the older couples sometimes on screen... to know what my parents exactly go there & feel (but never tell me) like that. B/c that is\n\nreality and truth -not just your young love, we don't stay young forever lol! But yes I know there are movies that have older couples, but they are usually just there. I mean on average movies most of the time excuse the fact that how much in love they still are (which I adore)... especially like this movie!\n\nAlright on to the movie -I have read what people have been saying that Something's Gotta Give is predictable. Uhm well of course, I knew how it KINDA baselined to be from trailers also. But come on how many love stories do that?? They end up falling in love.. then have troubles.. at the end get together! A LOT. But to those who are reading this right now: IT IS NOT *ALL* PREDICTABLE!!\n\nI love Keanu Reeves in this movie! He is very sweet and truly in love.. he was just right. I actually enjoyed him the best (besides Diane & Jack's love). Why you might ask? Hm.. let me just say Keanu played a better guy then Jack (him being a young ladies man/player).\n\nBut all in all I really liked it! At times (cus of its length) it may drag a little, but that is it's only faults. It has enough humor/love/sweetness, lol, to make it a great movie!! It all depends on your tastes too (I've heard from various ppl that mainly it's a married woman's type of movie). But anyone could like it I believe, so at your very least... you can rent it, hopefully then it'll be led to buying it :D\n\nI give it a 8.5/10! *Alaina"}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Something's Gotta Give", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1234370841", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM0MjIwYzMtODFhNS00ZWQ0LWEyNTItNTZhNWVhMzdiNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM0MjIwYzMtODFhNS00ZWQ0LWEyNTItNTZhNWVhMzdiNWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:50:52Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000197/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack Nicholson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0000197?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harry Sanborn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000206/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Keanu Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0000206?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Julian Mercer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001605/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Amanda Peet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0001605?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Marin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001274/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Paul Michael Glaser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0001274?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1569535/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Paige Butcher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm1569535?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Beauty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1829854/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kristine Szabo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm1829854?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Beauty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1576104/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tamara Spoelder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm1576104?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Beauty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1615782/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Vanessa Trump"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm1615782?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Beauty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000473/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Diane Keaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0000473?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Erica Barry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000531/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frances McDormand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0000531?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Zoe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269463/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jon Favreau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0269463?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Leo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001797/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rachel Ticotin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0001797?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Martinez"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1576353/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tanya Sweet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm1576353?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Beauty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0886970/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Daniella Van Graas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm0886970?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Beauty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1615770/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Sonja Francis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0337741/characters/nm1615770?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Beauty"}]}]}

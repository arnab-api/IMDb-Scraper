Patrick Warburton is hilarious! All the characters of the series are great however i'm not a huge fan of the little dwarf 'Russel'. His acting looks really forced and sometimes it's over the top.\n\nThe best part of the show is probably all the different characters who happen to be friends. This usually leads to funny moments during the show. I think people who are watching this show can relate to some of the characters. Me for example, can relate to Jeff! \"Woman let me watch the game, and if your going that way could u get me a drink?\". My girlfriend can relate to Audrey who would probably tell them to get it them self and would be whining about going to visit friends, parents, shopping.. or whatever.\n\nPatrick Warburton is a great actor and very underrated! Some reviewer said that he couldn't deliver a joke. That's complete BS! The way 'Jeff' delivers a joke is great! He is sarcastic and with his deep voice it's a killer combination. I think he is the funniest guy in the show by far! If your looking for a hilarious series, you've found it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Rules Of Engagement: Clip 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4021533977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc0ZDkwYjgtNGM2NS00ZDE3LWIxYTMtMWY3OTg5Y2UwMzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc0ZDkwYjgtNGM2NS00ZDE3LWIxYTMtMWY3OTg5Y2UwMzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Rules Of Engagement: Clip 2", "uploadDate": "2019-03-15T00:17:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0911320/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Patrick Warburton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0790772/characters/nm0911320?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeff Bingham"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005029/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Oliver Hudson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0790772/characters/nm0005029?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Adam Rhodes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005450/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Spade"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0790772/characters/nm0005450?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Russell Dunbar"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3418373/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kellen Love"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0790772/characters/nm3418373?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Diner Busboy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "50 episodes, 2009-2011"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0697044/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Megyn Price"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0790772/characters/nm0697044?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Audrey Bingham"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0435323/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bianca Kajlich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0790772/characters/nm0435323?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jennifer Morgan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "100 episodes, 2007-2013"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2290876/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Adhir Kalyan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0790772/characters/nm2290876?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Timmy Patel"}, {"url": "#", "name": "71 episodes, 2009-2013"}]}]}

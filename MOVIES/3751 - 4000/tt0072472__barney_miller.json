He mostly kept it all moving well. The eye of the 'cane if you will.\n\nThis was a very well cast show that had nothing BUT likable characters. Everyone had their quirks.\n\nWojo was your typical naive youngster. Fish was the cynical vet. Harris your (almost) militant. And Yemena (RIP Jack) the sarcastic one. \n\nHarris was a paradox. One episode had him as a powerful black man while another had him as a staunch republican. Deitrich (Steve Landesberg also RIP) replaced Fish basically. Both in role and personality.\n\nThe humor was bone dry. \n\nGreat show and I'm glad it's in reruns still.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Barney Miller: The Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2324078873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkOWRjZmEtYTVjNS00NTdiLThhMWItYjQyNzFmZTg1MjFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkOWRjZmEtYTVjNS00NTdiLThhMWItYjQyNzFmZTg1MjFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Barnry Miller: The Complete Series", "uploadDate": "2012-01-17T06:06:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0511604/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hal Linden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0072472/characters/nm0511604?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Capt.

Connery WAS Bond from the instant he appeared on screen and remember Ian Fleming, his creator was still alive at this stage. (Fleming in fact saw the first three Bonds but died before the release of THUNDERBALL)\n\nDR NO set the standards, albeit with a limited budget, for the entire series. Action, pretty girls, one-liners and impossibly cashed-up enemies. My own father was a confirmed Bond addict (having worked in army intelligence during WW2) and had been greatly looking forward to the release of this film. Cruelly, he died just a couple of weeks before its premiere in London in 1962. I made up for it however by seeing it four days running. At the time, just about as exciting as films got, it was an enormous box office smash and vindicated the studio's decision to sign Connery. Fleming in fact had wanted Roger Moore for the role, who was then riding high with THE SAINT worldwide and was unavailable for filming. Connery, who's only claim to fame at the time was as a part time male model and bit-part actor, his biggest role having been as a truckie in HELL DRIVERS three years earlier.\n\nOf course DR NO is dated now - its 40 years old! and deserves to be looked at from that standpoint The action sequences were raw in parts, pretty good in others. Sure the car chase scenes in Jamaica with the laughable back-projections are a cackfest now but none of this matters. The sets were imaginative, the fights good stuff, Ursula Andress enough for any young man's wet dream and Wiseman as DR No himself probably the best villain of them all, despite his very limited screentime. Very imaginative sets for the time and pyrotechnics to please. \n\nWhen it came to my home-town I took several days off college and watched it with fellow students. This was way better than Latin and calculus!"}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Dr. No", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3725330201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxZGZkMTItMjBiMS00NTQzLTk3YjUtZGU1MzNlNzcyMGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxZGZkMTItMjBiMS00NTQzLTk3YjUtZGU1MzNlNzcyMGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Dr. No", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T15:10:09Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000125/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sean Connery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0000125?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Bond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0936476/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joseph Wiseman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0936476?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. No"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496866/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bernard Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0496866?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "M."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0551243/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Zena Marshall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0551243?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Miss Taro"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0311013/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Eunice Gayson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0311013?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sylvia Trench"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0078252/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Peter Burton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0078252?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Major Boothroyd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0596304/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michel Mok"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0596304?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sister Rose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0288126/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "William Foster-Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0288126?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Superintendent Duff"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000266/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ursula Andress"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0000266?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Honey Ryder"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0520437/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jack Lord"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0520437?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Felix Leiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206060/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Anthony Dawson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0206060?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Professor Dent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0457839/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "John Kitzmiller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0457839?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Quarrel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561755/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lois Maxwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0561755?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Miss Moneypenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0793553/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Yvonne Shima"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0793553?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sister Lily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0506759/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Marguerite LeWars"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0055928/characters/nm0506759?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Annabel Chung - Photographer"}]}]}

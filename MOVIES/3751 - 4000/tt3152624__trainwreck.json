I think one must watch Apatow's films a few times to really soak them all up. I liked \"Trainwreck,\" but didn't love it. I'm hoping I'll like it more after I've seen it a few times. It was very obvious that some of the jokes just didn't work. Some of the scenes didn't work well enough. The intervention scene was clunky, contrived and sophomoric. I think Apatow could have done a polish on the screenplay to improve it a little. I love his long films, but this is the first time where I think he should have cut down the length. \n\nLebron James was funny. During his first scene, his acting was pretty wooden and made me uncomfortable, but it got better as the film progressed. Amy Schumer and Bill Hader were excellent. I think this is Colin Quinn's best performance ever. I didn't realize that Tilda Swinton was in the film until the credits. She was excellent as well. \n\nThis was not a train wreck of a film, but it did need some tightening up and extra thought.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2692067353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDI2MjIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUyMzYwNjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDI2MjIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUyMzYwNjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Having thought that monogamy was never possible, a commitment-phobic career woman may have to face her fears when she meets a good guy.", "uploadDate": "2015-06-24T05:45:44Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0703800/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Colin Quinn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3152624/characters/nm0703800?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7106491/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carla Oudin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3152624/characters/nm7106491?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Five Year Old Kim"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2019219/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Josh Segarra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3152624/characters/nm2019219?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Staten Island Oli"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7106492/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Robert E.

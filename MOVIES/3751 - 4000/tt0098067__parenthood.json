Everyone has a colorful family to some extent; most (I hope) are full of good natured people but there are always rotten apples floating around.\n\nDirector Ron Howard puts many lives on display and different challenges each one faces and every one of these inspections have something to offer. Steve Martin's reactions to his older son's adjustment problems are very well realized, with many humorous moments, to be sure, but at the core is a maturely handled and moving segment, and Martin has rarely been better.\n\nDiane Wiest's family drama consists of her inability to communicate properly to her two teenage children; the daughter a temperamental rebel with a \"loser\" boyfriend, the son a nearly recluse loner with raging hormones who thinks something is wrong with him (what guy hasn't been there at least once?). Superb performances form Wiest and (yes, surprisingly) Keanu Reeves really fuel this story which never loses itself despite seeing many humorous aspects in a rather depressing household.\n\nJason Robards plays the family father who hasn't been all that good to his children since...well ever, and he faces a tough assignment when he has to admit to himself that one of his children, who has learned the most from him, is heading into disaster fast. The scene where he asks Steve Martin for advice is a moving scene in so many ways; it's never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks.\n\nRick Moranis's tale of his insanely intellectual daughter is my least favorite but it does have a very charming conclusion. And that granny is priceless.\n\nParenthood may be even better for those who have children and can identify with some situations depicted here but as for me, I think I can learn a thing or two for years to come.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Parenthood", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi126786329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQ0MTY1MmUtMjZhZS00OWEzLTg3N2EtMGYzZjhhMDEwYWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQ0MTY1MmUtMjZhZS00OWEzLTg3N2EtMGYzZjhhMDEwYWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Parenthood", "uploadDate": "2011-01-14T06:22:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000188/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Steve Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0000188?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001848/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dianne Wiest"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0001848?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Helen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001548/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rick Moranis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0001548?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nathan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000588/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Martha Plimpton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0000588?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Julie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0468772/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Harley Jane Kozak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0468772?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Susan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001618/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Joaquin Phoenix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0001618?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Garry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0789753/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Helen Shaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0789753?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Grandma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0512912/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Paul Linke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0512912?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "George Bowman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005460/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mary Steenburgen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0005460?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Karen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001673/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jason Robards"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0001673?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frank"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001371/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tom Hulce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0001371?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Larry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000206/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Keanu Reeves"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0000206?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tod"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0240797/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dennis Dugan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0240797?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "David Brodsky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0752527/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Eileen Ryan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0752527?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Marilyn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0279557/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jasen Fisher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0098067/characters/nm0279557?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kevin"}]}]}

Here's the basic premise: bigoted AWG with a dutiful if slow-on-the-uptake wife lets his daughter and her far-far-far-*far*-left-wing husband live with them so he can finish school, and then the adventure begins! So, yes, Archie Bunker is a jerk. He's notorious for getting himself in way too deep in situations involving race, religion, orientation, and activism. His wife Edith serves as a naive voice of reason... usually to the annoyance of her husband. Daughter Gloria is proud of her husband Mike, to whom Archie always refers as \"meathead\" (dead from the neck up). And Archie can't move past the fact that Mike is Polish and liberal.\n\nAdding other dimensions to the series are their neighbors, the Jeffersons (whose race frequently causes Archie to put himself in trouble with his ethnically-based comments), and, of course, among others, Cousin Maude-- Edith's no-nonsense cousin who shows up every so often just to push Archie's buttons. The writing is always fresh, the humor works nearly every time, and it's an absolute joy to see the cast at work-- the chemistry is perfect.\n\nI really wish they could make a sitcom like this that actually works again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "All In The Family", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1775090969", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWMyMzI4NjktN2NkYy00MDFjLTk3OGEtZjI2MDFhYWY3ZTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWMyMzI4NjktN2NkYy00MDFjLTk3OGEtZjI2MDFhYWY3ZTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "All In The Family", "uploadDate": "2019-04-06T20:11:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005279/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carroll O'Connor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066626/characters/nm0005279?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Archie Bunker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "208 episodes, 1968-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001661/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rob Reiner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066626/characters/nm0001661?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael 'Meathead' Stivic"}, {"url": "#", "name": "183 episodes, 1971-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822958/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jean Stapleton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066626/characters/nm0822958?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Edith Bunker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "208 episodes, 1968-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001783/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sally Struthers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0066626/characters/nm0001783?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gloria Bunker-Stivic"}, {"url": "#", "name": "183 episodes, 1971-1979"}]}]}

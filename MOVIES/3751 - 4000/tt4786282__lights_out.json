If you like horror I'd say go see it. It is a jump scare movie but there's some depth and story to it. Character development was great, actually get to care about them and want to see them make it out. Acting was pretty good. F/X were good. The only part that I didn't like was they did the explanation of the backstory by one character explaining it to another. I always hate when they do that, just seems lazy.\n\nThe audience really got into it with a lot of people jumping and then a lot of giggles at themselves and others for jumping. Oh and in our screening the comedic relief of the big guy down front yelling \"oh s**t\" every time Diana jumps out. It reminded me of when I was a young teen and we'd get a whole group to go see the newest horror (F13,Halloween etc)You can't take it too seriously, just sit back and enjoy it.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 8/10 which is pretty good for a horror flick.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H21M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3014047513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg3NTM1Nzg2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg5NDYyOTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg3NTM1Nzg2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg5NDYyOTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When Rebecca left home, she thought she left her childhood fears behind.

Sinatra was due to play Harry, but had to withdraw, clearing the way for Clint.  Given Sinatra's unique brand of self-loathing, Harry would have been an uglier personality than Clint made him.  As it is, Lieutenant Callaghan is an ornery anti-liberal cuss of a guy, but he is straight and likeable.  Arguably, it was this characterisation which made Eastwood a megastar.\n\nSan Francisco in 1971 was ready for stardom itself.  The West Coast love-in scene and the gay 'boom', together with McQueen's \"Bullitt\", raised awareness of San Francisco as an exciting liberal city with a photogenic skyline.  The film's funky score by Lalo Schifrin is perfectly-judged, and spawned numerous imitators.\n\nThe central narrative concerns a lone nut who is trying to hold the city to ransom.  He starts by murdering citizens to extort money from the mayor, then progresses to kidnapping children.  This plays cleverly on the inchoate anxieties of Middle America, where law-abiding people were puzzled and alarmed at the 'crime wave' and the threat it posed to them and their families.  Crime in the decades before the Kennedy assassination had been compartmentalised by Hollywood.  Gangsters were bad, but they killed other gangsters.  Now the danger was unpredictable, irrational - and solitary. The lone madman was as likely to strike against me or you as against an institution.  Only a single-minded strong man, operating on the fringes of the rules, could combat this new terror.\n\nHarry is a paradox.  In one sense, he is an 'outlaw'.  He has little respect for formal authority (in the opening minutes, we see him being rude to the mayor) and he carries a strictly non-regulation monster of a gun. Harry is openly racist and mutinous.  And yet he is also deeply moral.  He conforms to an unarticulated ethical code that is anglosaxon American.  He protects the weak and confronts the wrongdoers, no matter how the odds are stacked against him.  Indeed, the cowardly bureaucrats who will never reward him or promote him are able to exploit his profound decency.  They send him on all the difficult, dirty jobs because they know that his sense of right and wrong won't allow him to walk away.\n\nEarly in the film, the famous bank robbery scene occurs.  This has become so familiar that it hardly needs elaborating here, but to summarise, Harry foils an armed robbery using icy courage and grim humour - and his magnum handgun.  The special brand of Eastwood humour recurs throughout the story (eg, the suicide jumper and the gay called 'Alice').  White anglosaxon America is encouraged to laugh at the undergroups which supposedly threaten it.\n\nWhen the bad guy 'Scorpio' is cornered, he immediately starts bleating about his civil rights.  This is meant to arouse our fury, because we have seen him callously destroying the lives of others, and here he is exploiting the protection of the state.  To make matters worse, the state agrees with him.  We see the DA and a judge explaining to Harry why the cogent evidence against Scorpio is inadmissible.  Just exactly why the DA would call a meeting with a lowly policeman in order to explain department policy is far from clear, but the scene is  thematically necessary.  Scorpio is using the System against the decent, godfearing people who own it.  The liberal apparatus is skewed if it lets a killer walk away scot-free.\n\nThere are some illogicalities about the plot.  Such an important event as the cash drop is left to two cops working alone, when in reality there would be a massive covert operation.  When Scorpio beats the rap, there is no public outcry or media storm, and he is allowed to get on with his anonymous existence virtually untroubled.\n\nHowever, this hardly matters since the main thrust of the story is the coming showdown between Harry and the bad guy.  As the climax approaches, Harry drops out of the police operation.  Scorpio is at his manic worst on the hi-jacked school bus, alienating us nicely and suppressing any liberal twitches we may still be feeling.  Then we see Harry, standing as upright and sturdy as the Statue Of Liberty ...."}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Dirty Harry", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2141323545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTE3ZDE1ZWEtZTVmNi00NmI1LWEwZTUtN2QyZWE1YTg1NTMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTE3ZDE1ZWEtZTVmNi00NmI1LWEwZTUtN2QyZWE1YTg1NTMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

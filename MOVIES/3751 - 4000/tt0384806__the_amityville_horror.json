Ryan Reynolds turns in a very effective performance, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in \"The Shining.\" By the end of the flick, i was scared of the dude. The rest of the cast was solid, as well. Lots of scares throughout the film, but a little too much of the \"MTV style\" editing, especially in the last fifteen minutes or so. But all in all, a decent effort, just like i said.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nIf you're going into this expecting any resemblance WHATSOEVER to the book, the original film, or any of the stories told over the years, you're going to be severely disappointed. The filmmakers have pretty much left out the events that transpired in the novel and the previous film, and instead they take an extreme amount of liberty with the story and turn it into a series of stylized Hollywood scare tactics. Don't get me wrong, this is still effective, but if you're going to release a movie and promote it as \"Based on the True Story\" then you might wanna make sure that the movie at least RESEMBLES the original story.\n\nIn fact, George Lutz is currently in litigation with MGM films over the content of the movie, claiming that it shows his family in a potentially damaging light. When you see the flick, you'll understand why he's upset. I can't fault the guy.\n\nIf they had left the Amityville name off of this one and just released it as some generic haunted house movie, then i wouldn't have so many issues with it. But to even associate it with anything Amityville-related just seems wrong to me, because they have completely screwed it up. I would still recommend the film, and just caution potential viewers to forget everything you've ever seen or heard about Amityville. Otherwise you'll walk out of that theater just as annoyed as i was.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005351/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Lutz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416596/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jesse James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm0416596?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Billy Lutz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1631269/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm1631269?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chelsea Lutz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001311/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Philip Baker Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm0001311?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Father Callaway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1861863/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Brendan Donaldson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm1861863?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ronald Defeo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0464620/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rich Komenich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm0464620?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chief of Police"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1180243/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Danny McCarthy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm1180243?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Officer Greguski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1861898/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Taitano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm1861898?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stitch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0313534/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Melissa George"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm0313534?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kathy Lutz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1497548/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jimmy Bennett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm1497548?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michael Lutz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0629697/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rachel Nichols"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm0629697?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lisa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1861910/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Isabel Conner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm1861910?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jodie Defeo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035562/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Annabel Armour"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm0035562?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Realtor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1861867/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "David Gee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm1861867?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "ER Doctor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1861923/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nancy Lollar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0384806/characters/nm1861923?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Librarian"}]}]}

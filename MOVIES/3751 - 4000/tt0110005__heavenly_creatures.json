How odd, yet how pleasing.\"\n\nThis early writing and directorial effort by Peter Jackson and starring a young Kate Winslet is an odd one to pin down. Especially odd, since it's based on a true story (which I didn't know until the film was over). It's about the intense friendship between two girls living in New Zealand. One is sullen and withdrawn, the other, a wealthy transplant from England, is outspoken and draws attention with her very presence. Both are intelligent, imaginative, and share a similar casual darkness in their personalities.\u00a0\n\nAs their friendship blooms and grows more and more intense, their parents (this being set in the 50's) begin to suspect an unwholesome aspect to their relationship. When the threat of separation arises, the girls swiftly and resolutely settle on a grisly solution to their forced division: murder.\n\nThe movie shifts in tone often, from a sort of coming of age story, to the fanciful world of the girls' imaginations, to their rage and heartbreak at their parents. Kate Winslet was pretty good, but you could tell that she was still finding her way and confidence as an actress. I found the plot to be rather dull at the start, but it grew more interesting as it continued on to a rather abrupt ending.\u00a0\n\nInteresting is a good word to use describe Heavenly Creatures, as a whole. It held my attention, even during the parts where I was a little less than entertained. It's unflinchingly dark in some aspects, and innocent and childlike in others. I'd recommend it to most just based on the fact that it's something different, and there's merit in that. It's well-made, also, I just found my interest fluctuating too often to give the movie a higher score.\u00a0\n\nAnd how does Kate Winslet look almost exactly the same today as she did in 1994? Now that's a topic that's interesting enough to make a movie about.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001491/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Melanie Lynskey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0001491?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Pauline Parker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0670582/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sarah Peirse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0670582?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Honora Parker Rieper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0581378/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Clive Merrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0581378?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. Henry Hulme"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0112400/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jed Brophy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0112400?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John"}, {"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0112400?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nicholas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0325641/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gilbert Goldie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0325641?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dr. Bennett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0275088/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kirsti Ferry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0275088?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Wendy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0847715/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Darien Takle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0847715?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Miss Stewart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0611943/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Liz Mullane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0611943?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Collins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000701/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate Winslet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0000701?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Juliet Hulme"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0448712/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Diana Kent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0448712?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hilda Hulme"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640519/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Simon O'Connor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0640519?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Herbert Rieper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0254591/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter Elliott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0254591?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bill Perry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0372647/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Geoffrey Heath"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110005/characters/nm0372647?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rev.

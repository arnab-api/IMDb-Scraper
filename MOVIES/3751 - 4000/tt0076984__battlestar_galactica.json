Larson, who also created 'Knight Rider', another TV series from my childhood.\n\nNow, looking at it through an adult's perspective, it is lesser great than it was in the days of innocence, but still 'Battlestar Gallactica' shines in nostalgia. Although some episodes were better than others and they always had their flaws, the show really gives that feeling of nostalgia. If not perfect, at least it is authentic. It is from a time when things were real, when things had a special magic. The opening, for example, is fantastic, with those spectacular images of space and space wars. The opening music too is absolutely wonderful, and that opening quote is memorable: \n\n\u00abThere are those who believe that life here began out there, far across the universe, with tribes of humans who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians, or the Toltecs, or the Mayans. Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive somewhere beyond the heavens.\u00bb\n\nLike I said, it's by no means a perfect TV show. But the action scenes and their delicious sounds, the special effects, the space backgrounds... ahhh.... it's all so authentic and perfect (as it should be), without any of the excessive action and explosive noise seen these days.\n\nIt starred Lorne Greene as Commander Adama, Richard Hatch as Captain Apollo and Dirk Benedict as Lt. Starbuck, all of them great. Most of these episodes also had Noah Hathaway in a minor role as Boxey, Apollo's little son. Boxey is the cute little tyke. Him and his Muffit. This was a few years before he \"became\" Atreyu. Too bad Boxey doesn't have a bigger role. \n\nInevitably, this TV series resembles '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars'. It was even accused of plagiarism when 'Star Wars' itself heavily drank ideas from an early 70's film called 'Silent Running'."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Galactica 1980", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1051263257", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRlYmNkY2UtMDg0NC00Yjc0LWJlOTItODkzMTQzY2UyMmZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRlYmNkY2UtMDg0NC00Yjc0LWJlOTItODkzMTQzY2UyMmZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:14:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0368745/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Hatch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0368745?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Captain Apollo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001296/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lorne Greene"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0001296?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Commander Adama"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0171475/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Colicos"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0171475?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Count Baltar"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000441/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Noah Hathaway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0000441?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Boxey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0841985/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tony Swartz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0841985?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Flight Sergeant Jolly"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0338427/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David Greenan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0338427?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Flight Officer Omega"}, {"url": "#", "name": "18 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0750706/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sarah Rush"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0750706?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Flight Corporal Rigel"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0070767/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dirk Benedict"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0070767?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lieutenant Starbuck"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0420170/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Herbert Jefferson Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0420170?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lieutenant Boomer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0421596/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maren Jensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0421596?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lieutenant Athena"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0816783/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Laurette Spang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0816783?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Cassiopeia"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141956/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Terry Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0141956?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Colonel Tigh"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0516860/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Anne Lockhart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0076984/characters/nm0516860?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lieutenant Sheba"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 1978-1979"}]}]}

Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel and Bradley Cooper.\n\nIn the late '90s, Jim Carrey decided he'd had enough of playing the silly goofball and started on a path to more serious films like \"The Truman Show.\" Ten years later, he's had his share of hits, but for the most part, his comedic efforts have fallen flat. Excusing 2003's fairly enjoyable \"Bruce Almighty\", Carrey hasn't had much recent success with the genre that he once dominated (\"Fun with Dick and Jane\", anyone?).\n\nIn \"Yes Man\", the skilled physical comedian has dusted off the cobwebs and is back in good form. Carrey really seems to be enjoying himself, putting on his best game face and immersing himself in the sight gags and slapstick madness that were so commonplace in his earlier films. He hasn't lost his touch or his talent at making people laugh, and he makes sure that the audience knows it.\n\nTruthfully, the plot to \"Yes Man\" is irrelevant. Carl Allen (Carrey), a man afraid of living life, challenges himself to say 'yes' to everything for an entire year. Hilarity ensues and in the end, everyone learns a lesson. It's nothing more than a vehicle to showcase Carrey's ability. But really, which one of his comedies isn't? There are no unexpected twists or surprise endings, just Jim Carrey doing what Jim Carrey does best. Everything else is secondary.\n\nThe film is rounded out rather nicely by a few of its supporting players. Zooey Deschanel is a cute and bubbly romantic interest who even adds a bit of mayhem to the proceedings, instead of being relegated to straight-man status. \"Flight of the Conchords'\" Rhys Darby shines as Carl's Harry Potter-obsessed co-worker. However, some of the cast feels extraneous. Bradley Cooper and \"That '70s Show's\" Danny Masterson are given little to do, and contribute little as a result. The missed opportunities are irksome, but will do little to affect one's enjoyment of the film.\n\n\"Yes Man\" is a fun time waiting to be had for those who know what to expect. The movie is generally funny throughout, but not clever or inventive enough to justify a second look. It's the kind of entertainment that leaves you chuckling, but won't be remembered long after viewing. The biggest thing going for the film is that it has re-energized Jim Carrey. He's an absolute joy to watch; one only wishes that \"Yes Man\" could keep up with him.\n\nFinal Grade: C+", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Yes Man", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3042902041", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNTAzMzE5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU3MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNTAzMzE5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU3MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Yes Man - Trailer #2", "uploadDate": "2008-11-12T09:28:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000120/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Carrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0000120?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177896/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bradley Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0177896?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1055302/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rhys Darby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm1055302?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Norman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001217/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Fionnula Flanagan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0001217?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tillie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0018734/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Sasha Alexander"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0018734?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lucy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0109785/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brent Briscoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0109785?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Homeless Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0182824/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John Cothran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0182824?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Tweed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0639917/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sean O'Bryan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0639917?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ted"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0221046/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Zooey Deschanel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0221046?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Allison"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383422/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "John Michael Higgins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0383422?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005194/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Danny Masterson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0005194?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rooney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000654/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Terence Stamp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0000654?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Terrence"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0801356/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Molly Sims"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0801356?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stephanie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0140969/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Rocky Carroll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0140969?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Wes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308208/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Spencer Garrett"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1068680/characters/nm0308208?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Multack"}]}]}

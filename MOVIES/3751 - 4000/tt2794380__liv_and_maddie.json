Bland shows that last for 2 seasons tops, low ratings and a lack of fresh ideas.\n\nLiz and Maddie seems to be the last good sitcom this channel had. (Not saying that the shows that aired alongside liv and Maddie were good, but live and Maddie on its own was the last good show.)\n\nDove Cameron plays both roles really well, and the acting from others is fine as well. Some characters can be written annoying such as Joey, but they have lots of charm. Least favorite character was that friend Maddie has, think name was willow or something. Jokes are more hit and miss than I like, but they do hit.\n\nBiggest problem seems to be that it doesn't have the quality the older Disney sitcoms have. And most of those weren't even that great! If it didn't air on Disney Channel, but on Fox or another cable network as a family friendly sitcom, the show would get a 4. I'm just happy that this show was good at the time it aired.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Liv and Maddie", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1065532441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk0NGIxMDYtMzc5My00Mjc4LTgyODgtNGIwMDUyODIxZjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk0NGIxMDYtMzc5My00Mjc4LTgyODgtNGIwMDUyODIxZjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Liv and Maddie", "uploadDate": "2019-04-22T21:35:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4874651/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dove Cameron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2794380/characters/nm4874651?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Liv Rooney"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5529735/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tenzing Norgay Trainor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2794380/characters/nm5529735?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Parker Rooney"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5027231/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emmy Mattingly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2794380/characters/nm5027231?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Liv 2"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0454482/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Benjamin King"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2794380/characters/nm0454482?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pete Rooney"}, {"url": "#", "name": "65 episodes, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4192879/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joey Bragg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2794380/characters/nm4192879?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joey Rooney"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0733812/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kali Rocha"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2794380/characters/nm0733812?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Karen Rooney"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5346263/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Shelby Wulfert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2794380/characters/nm5346263?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maddie 2"}, {"url": "#", "name": "80 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0305268/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jessica Marie Garcia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2794380/characters/nm0305268?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Willow Cruz"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}]}

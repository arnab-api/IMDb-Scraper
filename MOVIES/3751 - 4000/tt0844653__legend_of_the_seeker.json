What do people think so far? Looking at the comments we get a load of onestars from people saying it doesn't follow the books to the letter, people that can't understand how Goodkind could \"sell his soul to Hollywood\" (really... wow), and people that make untrue claims about inaccuracies in the TV-series apparently without having watched it themselves. \n\nSo is the Legend of the Seeker that awful? Nah, not really. It's a fun series, a bit heavy on the comedy on some occasions, and it's taken a while to get the story rolling, but its good fun to watch, beautiful scenery, good main actors that feel believable. It doesn't take itself too seriously and in my opinion, neither should the viewers.\n\nIn conclusion: The naysayers say, No! Horrible! Goodkind sells his soul to mammon! But I'm sure after an honest viewing without preconceptions most will agree that its a nice example of a good, old-fashioned fantasy story with all the sword slashing, magicking, and vanilla romance to make it a recurring theme in the rss-downloader.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Legend of the Seeker: The Complete Second Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi695404313", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA0OGY5YWEtYTZmNy00YTI3LTk5ODItMWQ1M2VkMmQ0MzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA0OGY5YWEtYTZmNy00YTI3LTk5ODItMWQ1M2VkMmQ0MzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT #1", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T16:04:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0395097/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Craig Horner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844653/characters/nm0395097?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Cypher"}, {"url": "#", "name": "44 episodes, 2008-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0817748/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bruce Spence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844653/characters/nm0817748?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander"}, {"url": "#", "name": "44 episodes, 2008-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3248988/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tabrett Bethell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844653/characters/nm3248988?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cara Mason"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2009-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2125623/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bridget Regan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844653/characters/nm2125623?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kahlan Amnell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "44 episodes, 2008-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0662164/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Craig Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0844653/characters/nm0662164?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Darken Rahl"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2008-2010"}]}]}

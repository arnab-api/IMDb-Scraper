I'm glad NF developed this as an original series. I watched all three seasons and wish there was more! The premise was so basic, Dylan has to inform his previous lovers that he has an STD. Because of great writing, Dylan's adventures turn into a closer look at his relationships and those of his flatmates, Luke, Evie and their friend, Angus. And, the relationships are realistic, messy, and complicated. But, throughout it all you want them all to find happiness.

The setup of Extract is eccentric enough to fit those social comedies: an artificial flavoring factory filled with oddball assembly workers and an accident where one of them loses a testicle.\n\nBut writer/director Judge can't fully match the promise of the premise as he tailors only a few scenes to his brash humor: for example, three men on a bong is smart on several levels, especially the timing and Jason Bateman's laid-back factory-owner Joel, who doesn't fit the smoking scene but whose droll responses to Ben Affleck's New -Age bartender are quite funny.\n\nBateman's everyman persona holds the cast and story together as well as he can in spite of the many slow scenes and repetitious comedic bits such as the nerdy neighbor (David Koechner), who appears too many times in an annoying bit about The Rotary Club, and the testicle motif.\n\nUnderneath the shallow humor lies a commentary worth attention\u2014the plight of the factory workers waiting for a company to be sold with few places for them to go. Seen from management's point of view, they are racist slackers who can compromise their own well-being by damaging production at will. With the humorous daily shenanigans of those line workers halting production for various petty jealousies and intrigues, Extract is not a bad commentary on the vicissitudes of factory life for management and workers.\n\nJoel's vacant sex life--his wife, Suzie (Kirsten Wiig) is not responsive-- heightens the social commentary concerning the trade offs of the American dream that needs tending 24/7. But I stretch to make something out of the weak end of summer film fare. Extract is simply an extract of the larger comedic genre which will have to wait for fall to be adequately seasoned.\n\nI hope."}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Extract", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4097835801", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDk5NTIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY2MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDk5NTIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY2MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The owner of a flower-extract plant (Bateman) tries to contend with myriad personal and professional problems, such as his potentially unfaithful wife (Wiig), a sexy new temp (Kunis), and employees who want to take advantage of him.", "uploadDate": "2009-04-15T09:53:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000867/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jason Bateman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1225822/characters/nm0000867?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Joel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1325419/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kristen Wiig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1225822/characters/nm1325419?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Suzie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0799777/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "J.K.

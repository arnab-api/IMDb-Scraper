Imagine what an impact this film had on me (my movie diet had so far consisted of Chaplin and Disney films - which, of course, is not at all a bad thing).\n\nThe experience was simply mesmerizing. Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal, revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen - and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over, my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. \n\nDespite its 212 minutes running time, this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow Judah Ben-Hur's dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again, the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.\n\nIt's hard to imagine anything more cinematic, especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory, it's Ben Hur. And even now, after I've seen the film many, many times, I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and I don't mean that in a religious sense).\n\nMy verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many \"sandal and sword\" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. With its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which I think hold up amazingly well - Ben Hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history.\n\nPure cinema and a must see. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT3H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Ben-Hur: 50th Anniversary Ultimate Collectors Edition [Blu-Ray]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1269283609", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEwNjM3NDktYjEyMS00NTVmLThlMDktN2Y2ZmNkODYwZjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGEwNjM3NDktYjEyMS00NTVmLThlMDktN2Y2ZmNkODYwZjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2018-05-23T17:03:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000032/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlton Heston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0000032?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Judah Ben-Hur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0361823/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Haya Harareet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0361823?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Esther"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0341518/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hugh Griffith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0341518?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sheik Ilderim"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640732/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cathy O'Donnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0640732?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tirzah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0192958/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Finlay Currie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0192958?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Balthasar"}, {"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0192958?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Narrator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519281/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Terence Longdon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0519281?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Drusus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0603682/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Morell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0603682?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sextus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0370144/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jack Hawkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0370144?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Quintus Arrius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000963/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Stephen Boyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0000963?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Messala"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0779549/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Martha Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0779549?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Miriam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0415488/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sam Jaffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0415488?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Simonides"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0861930/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Frank Thring"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0861930?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pontius Pilate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0718835/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "George Relph"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0052618/characters/nm0718835?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tiberius Caesar"}]}]}

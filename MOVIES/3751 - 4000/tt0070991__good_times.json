I think the critics of this show miss the point of the show. I don't find it stereotypical or shuckin'/jivin' at all. This was a family that just happened to be black and live in the projects. They didn't dwell on it. They were actually trying to do everything they could to get out of the projects. JJ wanted to be an artists. Thelma, a dancer. Michael, involved in legal/justice. Seems to me nowadays, the projects or ghetto life is romanticized (see BET videos or MTV videos), whereas the Evans family in \"Good Times\" was trying to get out and onto something better. Headed by two parents who realized there own shortcomings (lack of education, money), but didn't they try to lead by example by teaching their kids values, strong work ethic and didn't they try to IMPROVE the lives of THEIR children? They tried to show their kids to strive for more in life, DESPITE obstacles. James tried to work several jobs, just so Florida could stay home and tend to the needs of the house/family. Some may find that chauvinistic by today's standards, but, I'm not so sure about that. Seems to me when at least one parent was in the home, children were a bit more manageable. What better representation of a family values can you ask for? A great show! Better than most of the family comedies today!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Good Times", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3303980313", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZkN2Y3M2UtYzYxZi00OWU1LThjMTAtZDkxNzMxOGIzMTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZkN2Y3M2UtYzYxZi00OWU1LThjMTAtZDkxNzMxOGIzMTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Good Times", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T01:29:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0238840/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ja'net DuBois"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070991/characters/nm0238840?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Willona Woods"}, {"url": "#", "name": "133 episodes, 1974-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822304/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "BernNadette Stanis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070991/characters/nm0822304?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thelma Evans"}, {"url": "#", "name": "133 episodes, 1974-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0738354/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Esther Rolle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070991/characters/nm0738354?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Florida Evans"}, {"url": "#", "name": "109 episodes, 1974-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0113900/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Johnny Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070991/characters/nm0113900?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nathan Bookman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 1975-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141876/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ralph Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070991/characters/nm0141876?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Evans"}, {"url": "#", "name": "133 episodes, 1974-1979"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0907858/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jimmie Walker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0070991/characters/nm0907858?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "James 'J.J.'

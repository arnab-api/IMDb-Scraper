Usually when a trailer needs to draw reference to 'one's we made earlier' (in this case Lock, Stock, and Snatch) when the writer or director of said films has nothing to do with the project, the end result is a poor copycat. After watching the film, I am more than impressed!\n\nLayer Cake introduces us (once more) to the world of the cockney gangsters, and the dealing of drugs. The medication of choice this time is Ecstacy, and the set up involves an up-and-coming name in the dealing trade being thrown a job by one of the big names. Sent to find a missing girl, and also buy and sell on a large shipment, it all seems like easy work. However, as he soon finds, things are not always as they seem, and before long his life is at risk when the deal begins to go sour.\n\nFor the first 20 minutes of the film I couldn't decide whether it was going to be a Lock, Stock, or Honest (the dreadful All Saints film). The film uses the obligatory 'catchy' tunes from the past 2 decades, and uses the same type of framing of scenes as the genre. For the first 20 minutes, whilst we were introduced rapidly to the characters in the tale, it was hard to discern where the plot was going, and even harder to care much about the players. By the half way point I was engrossed! The plot twists and turns at various points throughout, and you do begin to care about the lead character and the associates around him.\n\nThe film oozes cockney cool, and although not quite on par with the best of the genre, it is still a worthy, and very engrossing, offering from director Matthew Vaughn. Stylishly shot, with a great soundtrack, this is one of those films that blokes will walk out of very pleased, but their partners may not feel the same way. Whilst not really violent or sexist in nature, this is a lads film through and through, and it is one cake that I want another slice of."}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Layer Cake", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2510946585", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGE2NmQ5NmMtZDdiYS00ZjE0LTkwZDgtNWZhZWFhYmVkNGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGE2NmQ5NmMtZDdiYS00ZjE0LTkwZDgtNWZhZWFhYmVkNGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:18:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185819/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Daniel Craig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0185819?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "XXXX"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0286044/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jamie Foreman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0286044?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Duke"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1218607/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Burn Gorman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm1218607?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gazza"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364711/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "George Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0364711?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Morty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000538/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Colm Meaney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0000538?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gene"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0535837/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Francis Magee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0535837?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paul the Boatman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186469/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kenneth Cranham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0186469?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jimmy Price"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1508805/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nathalie Lunghi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm1508805?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Charlie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0362766/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tom Hardy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0362766?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Clarkie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1020089/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sally Hawkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm1020089?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Slasher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2903328/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Brinley Green"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm2903328?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nobby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1268748/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tamer Hassan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm1268748?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Terry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411903/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Marcel Iures"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0411903?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Slavo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0028222/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dimitri Andreas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm0028222?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Angelo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1395778/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Garry Tubbs"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0375912/characters/nm1395778?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Brian"}]}]}

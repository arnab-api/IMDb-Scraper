I understand how it's pretty stupid but it still manages to entertain the viewer as well build a great amount of suspense in the 3rd act. Also props to Russell Crowe and Emma Watson for delivering great performance. Everyone else... Meh! The story is about Noah and how he is shown by god that a flood would be arriving soon due to how badly humankind has evolved. Noah and his family then go and visit Methuselah,played wonderfully by Anthony Hopkins who gives Noah his insight to building an ark. On the way Noah finds Ila who is injured badly and is unable to conceive. From there his family takes care of her and one of Noah's sons falls in love with her. 15 or so years later when Noah has almost finished building the ark a king comes and threatens him. Then the flood hits and chaos ensues with a great 3rd act and a suspenseful battle. The animals in the film looked quite unrealistic but the scene where the flood hits is outstanding and awesome. You are also introduced to these rock transformers who look cool but awfully unnecessary for a biblical film. There is also a great battle which includes them in it. The film is also enjoyable but quite slow in parts. The story is very nice and entertaining but has trouble in the 1st act by being way too slow. The 3rd act was awesome though. The script is pretty clich\u00e9d and stupid but if you endure these things you can have a good time with this film. The acting is also good but I still think that Logan Lerman is forced and too shy but he was good in the 1st Percy Jackson film. in this he didn't suit the role"}, "duration": "PT2H18M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi225552921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Inspired by the Biblical story, a man suffering visions of an apocalyptic deluge takes measures to protect his family a coming flood.", "uploadDate": "2014-03-12T08:16:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000128/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Russell Crowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0000128?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Noah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935653/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ray Winstone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0935653?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tubal-cain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0914612/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emma Watson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0914612?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ila"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3150488/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Douglas Booth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm3150488?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Shem"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0546797/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mark Margolis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0546797?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Magog"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5162411/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Leo McHugh Carroll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm5162411?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Japheth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1587729/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Finn Wittrock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm1587729?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young Tubal-cain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3918709/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gavin Casalegno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm3918709?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Young Shem"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000124/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jennifer Connelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0000124?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Naameh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000164/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anthony Hopkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0000164?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Methuselah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0503567/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Logan Lerman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0503567?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000560/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nick Nolte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0000560?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Samyaza"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0243806/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kevin Durand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0243806?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Rameel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0190744/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Marton Csokas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm0190744?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Lamech"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1956478/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Madison Davenport"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1959490/characters/nm1956478?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Na'el"}]}]}

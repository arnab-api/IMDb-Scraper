This show is a cleverly constructed concept that feels quite like it belongs on the stage. Gabriel Byrne uses his greatest talent - subtly of style - and performs exceptionally in the long pauses and lingering shots. Its addictive. Come 'Thursday' night you may feel cynical, but after 'Friday's' episode you just have to know what transpires the next week. In an age where we are all obsessed with over-analysing everything, this is a show that will appeal to many people with its everyday issues and obvious psychology that we are so keen to recognise in others, but not ourselves - a fact blatantly realised when the tables are turned and the therapist effectively goes to therapy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "In Treatment: Season 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4243242265", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWM3MTVjNmEtY2MyOC00YTNlLWIyNmUtZmM0NzBjYjZjODZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWM3MTVjNmEtY2MyOC00YTNlLWIyNmUtZmM0NzBjYjZjODZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In Treatment: Season 3", "uploadDate": "2019-04-04T21:20:16Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000321/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gabriel Byrne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0835434/characters/nm0000321?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Paul Weston"}, {"url": "#", "name": "106 episodes, 2008-2010"}]}]}

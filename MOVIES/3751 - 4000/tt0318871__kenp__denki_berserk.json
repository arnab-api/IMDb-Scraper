Nothing even comes close to capturing the interest of the viewer and holding it tightly throughout the ten hour duration of this masterpiece. Firstly, I must admit that it has its flaws, such as a few points of lazy animation, as in some of the battle scenes, as well as the somewhat disappointing ending, which leaves the viewer thirsting for more without the promise of any follow-up. Yet the fact of the matter is, and I speak for myself, that the positive aspects of Berserk outweigh the bad so drastically one cant help but overlook them in terms of the entire film. The frequent sub-par visuals mean nothing in comparison to the amazing plot depth and beautiful character development marbled throughout the film. \n\nIn summary, Berserk is a ten hour mini-series that consists of 25 20+ minute episodes detailing the life of a rogue swordsman named Guts. Guts, in short, is simply the most intriguing fictional character ever constructed. Guts, first of all, is one of the finest examples of an individual driven entirely by self preservation and improvement. Throughout the series Guts grows stronger and more deadly before our eyes, with each thrust of his massive sword. The personal relationships that he develops over time, especially with Griffith and Caska, are totally believable and honest. In particular, the love/hate relationship that Guts has with Caska sucks the viewer into their world and with each episode end leaves you literally thirsting for more. I can honestly say that I had never so anxiously awaited a release as I did with each progressing volume. \n\nThe score, other than being entirely redundant, creates an additional emotional appeal that quite literally leaves a mark in your mind. The opening theme song, although an acquired taste, becomes somewhat of a necessity to mark the beginning of each additional episode that will bring you deeper into the world of Guts and the Band of the Hawk. In no time at all you find yourself singing along with it as if it were a top forty tune. The climactic theme played every 3 episodes or so, is absolutely haunting, leading one to wonder how it came to be included in an anime.\n\n Berserk is a definite must-see for all fans of anime. For those who dislike anime or are indifferent to it, the mediocre visuals may tarnish your opinion of it, yet the rock solid plot and character depth with leave you amazed.      \n\nRating: Animation Quality: 7/10 Character Development: 10/10 Plot Line: 10/10 Overall Enjoyment: 12/10 (If that's at all possible)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Berserk", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi515506457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc3OTk3NTgtMzY0YS00ZDhhLTgxM2MtMTU1NGE2YmRlYWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc3OTk3NTgtMzY0YS00ZDhhLTgxM2MtMTU1NGE2YmRlYWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:31:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0370650/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nobutoshi Canna"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm0370650?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Guts"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1321026/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carrie Keranen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm1321026?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Caska"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411167/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Unsh\u00f4 Ishizuka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm0411167?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Narration"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2478830/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carla Tassara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm2478830?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Additional Voices"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0410907/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Akira Ishida"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm0410907?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Judeau"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0605451/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Toshiyuki Morikawa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm0605451?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Griffith"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0944985/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Akiko Yajima"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm0944985?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Rickert"}, {"url": "#", "name": "21 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0023719/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Masuo Amada"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm0023719?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Pippin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0996218/?ref_=tt_cl_t17", "name": "Michelle Newman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm0996218?ref_=tt_cl_t17", "name": "Ricket"}, {"url": "#", "name": "20 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1327264/?ref_=tt_cl_t19", "name": "Yasuyuki Kase"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm1327264?ref_=tt_cl_t19", "name": "Soldier B"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0794232/?ref_=tt_cl_t21", "name": "Yuri Shiratori"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm0794232?ref_=tt_cl_t21", "name": "Charlotte"}, {"url": "#", "name": "11 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1827148/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marc Diraison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0318871/characters/nm1827148?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Guts"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 1997-1998"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0998439/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kevin T.

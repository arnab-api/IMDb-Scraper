At first I thought, \"Lindsay Lohan? Who's that? And Jamie Lee Curtis? Isn't that the 'scream queen'?\" I didn't want to go, but that was that.\n\n Within the first few minutes of the movie, I rolled my eyes. I thought it was just a cliche movie about a mom and a daughter that fight a lot. I was bored. But ten minutes later, the magic began. I found my eyes glued to the massive screen, I found myself \"shushing\" anyone that interrupted my connection with the two stars. I was hooked, and that was that.\n\n Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis work wonders together. They have wonderful chemistry on screen that make you believe that they have, in fact, switched bodies. Both actresses were brilliant in their roles of switch reversal. Their acting was so real, their expressions so priceless. Awesome, too, was the movie's supporting cast. Enough said. The script was amazingly well written, the directing extraordinary.\n\nTo sum it up, this movie was \"freakishly good.\" Pure magic, I tell you.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2383330841", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM2NDVlZjgtMTcyYi00MmRmLWIxYjctNmRkOWI5YjBhY2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmM2NDVlZjgtMTcyYi00MmRmLWIxYjctNmRkOWI5YjBhY2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An overworked mother and her daughter do not get along.

Well \"like\" may not be the right word but let me tell you that I couldn't shake those images out of my mind for days. It happened the same with Haneke's last film \"The White Ribbon\" as well as with \"Cache\" and in particular with \"The Piano Teacher\" I'm fascinated by Michael Haneke but I don't trust him. I'm aware of his brilliance just as aware as he is. There is a self consciousness about his work that strips it of any form of innocence. That's very disturbing. Luis Bunuel felt triumphant when people fainted or vomited during his films but, in his case, it was clear where he was coming from. Ingman Bergman's purity couldn't have allow him to do a film like \"Funny Games\", Haneke made it, twice. An artist or a con man? I think both but that in itself is not that unusual, what is unusual is that the con is so rivetingly perpetrated. The ending of his film may provoke in you the desire to throw something at the screen and curse, curse very loudly. But, and here is where the con really works, I found myself wanting to see his films again. What's wrong with me? I think the answer is that I love film and Michael Heneke revisits some of my favorite filmmakers and does to them what the home invaders do to the family of \"Funny Games\" Extraordinary in as many ways as it is appalling. \"Funny Games is considered, by some, to be Michael Heneke's most commercial film, isn't that funny?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Funny Games (2008)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1420362009", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzU0MzQ4OGYtNWViNC00MGEyLWE0YTctYWUxMDBkMTQwYTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzU0MzQ4OGYtNWViNC00MGEyLWE0YTctYWUxMDBkMTQwYTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:14:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915208/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Naomi Watts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm0915208?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0685856/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michael Pitt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm0685856?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paul"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1492784/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Devon Gearhart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm1492784?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Georgie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0266441/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Siobhan Fallon Hogan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm0266441?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Betsy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3843676/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Susi Haneke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm3843676?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Betsy's Sister-in-Law"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000619/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tim Roth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm0000619?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "George"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1227232/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brady Corbet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm1227232?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Peter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0301305/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Boyd Gaines"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm0301305?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fred"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0526986/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Robert LuPone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm0526986?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Robert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002385/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Linda Moran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0808279/characters/nm0002385?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Eve"}]}]}

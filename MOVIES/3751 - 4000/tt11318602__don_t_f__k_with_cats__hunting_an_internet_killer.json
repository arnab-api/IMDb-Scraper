I liked this one too, up until the very last minute, where they're basically JUDGING us, the viewers, for watching THEIR DOCUMENTARY. If you think it's a dangerous story to tell, don't tell it. But don't go and judge me for the kind of movies and documentaries I watch, and even imply I indirectly contributed to this whole story. That's just dumb, at this point you're just biting the hand that feeds.\n\nBesides, they don't even explain crucial details, the biggest one being that third hand in the video. Who was it? Why isn't it a big deal? Cause it seems like a pretty big deal to me.\n\nIt's an overall 8/10 documentary, but for these reasons I'm going to rate it a 6/10 because it's just disrespectful towards the viewers.

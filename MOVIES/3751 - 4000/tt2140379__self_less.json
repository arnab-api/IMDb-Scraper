This one is exactly John Scalzi's, \"Old Man's War\"\u0085 series idea but Ol' John Perry had no idea what he was in for. In this outing of the idea Damien Hale did know\u0085 at least as much as the crippled Jake Sully in Avatar knew. Figure the dates..., and Avatar was probably \"influenced\" by Old Man's War. But it is a great idea, and folks can do a lot with it. This one is a tried and true \"character quest plot\" as well, which explaining creeps into the spoiler category if you don't already know what it is. If you do, you know those are usually great stories.\n\nTo me it was predictable. Not the movies fault that\u0085 I've read a lot. The plot has a couple ways to go. The way this one went is probably the most popular and well liked. I was a little surprised it wasn't \"more\". I think I just was not feeling the crash, bang, boom going on. I would have liked a little more getting in touch with the \"past training\". I think that would have sold me on the crash, bang, boom more convincingly.\n\nDon't misunderstand, it is a good movie. Ben Kingsley can do no wrong by me. Ryan Reynolds is working on getting there himself, and I have a spot in my heart for Natalie Martinez from the Under the Dome days. Sprinkle in some Victor Garber and you have a set of actors almost always worth watching. I enjoyed a couple of surprising plot point twists that I didn't see coming. Movie might be worth watching for those alone. It is great when a story surprises and that isn't an easy thing to sell to well conditioned entertainment consumers.\n\nTo me it is 7 stars reaching for 8 and almost making it. First review I looked at before watching the movie had me feeling like I was out in the desert looking into the night sky there were so many stars. It's worth watching.

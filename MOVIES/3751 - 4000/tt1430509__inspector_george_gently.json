Three years ago, admittedly, it didn't completely appeal to me, but when I did decide to give the series a chance I am glad I did, and am struggling to give a good enough reason why it didn't appeal to me before. Inspector George Gently is brilliant in every aspect. It is strikingly filmed, with the photography stunning and the scenery and locations very well chosen and evocative. The music is very good too, quite stirring and haunting, and always careful not to overshadow what is going on on screen. Then we are treated to some truly great writing that is intelligent and has the odd bit of subtle humour and complex but very well explained stories. The direction is very fine, and the acting is top notch consistently with the guest actors making the most of their characters and stories and Martin Shaw and Lee Ingleby brilliant both individually and together, complete with a very interesting chemistry. To conclude, this is a wonderful series that I can't wait to see more of. 10/10 Bethany Cox", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "George Gently: Series 7", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3990401817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2ZjODNmMGQtNGQ0OC00MzQ1LTg4MjctZjdmMzVlMWI0NDZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2ZjODNmMGQtNGQ0OC00MzQ1LTg4MjctZjdmMzVlMWI0NDZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for George Gently: Series 7", "uploadDate": "2015-08-16T04:24:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0789864/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Martin Shaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1430509/characters/nm0789864?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Gently"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2007-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2199894/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Simon Hubbard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1430509/characters/nm2199894?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "PC Taylor"}, {"url": "#", "name": "24 episodes, 2007-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0408846/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lee Ingleby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1430509/characters/nm0408846?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Bacchus"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2007-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3287529/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lisa McGrillis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1430509/characters/nm3287529?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rachel Coles"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2014-2017"}]}]}

Maybe that's because I was watching the movie with my mom when she asked me if that was true...\n\nAnyway, I loved JUST ONE OF THE GUYS, and still think of it fondly. It's a funny teen movie that doesn't rely on vulgarity for its humor, and I also remember how refreshingly non-homophobic the Rick Morehouse character acted when he thought his new \"male\" friend was developing a crush on him (1985's teen movies were strangely queer-friendly, as evidenced here, in A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 and ST. ELMO'S FIRE, and with Stephen Geoffreys starring in FRIGHT NIGHT and FRATERNITY VACATION).  Isn't that odd considering that, in the supposedly more tolerant times of today, there are teen movies like SORORITY BOYS that are more homophobic than those made during the Reagan years?\n\nAnd then there's William Zabka, whose character in JUST ONE OF THE GUYS  is one of a trio of supercilious cads he played in the '80's. Some enterprising Gen-X DVD producer should release a box set with this movie, THE KARATE KID and BACK TO SCHOOL; I know I'd buy it to revel in the Legend of Zabka."}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2121645593", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NmMmNlYzItNDg3MS00MDNlLWI0YmItYTQ1NGUxNzAwYWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NmMmNlYzItNDg3MS00MDNlLWI0YmItYTQ1NGUxNzAwYWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-22T17:57:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0405310/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Joyce Hyser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089393/characters/nm0405310?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Terry Griffith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0419747/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Billy Jayne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089393/characters/nm0419747?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Buddy Griffith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0951420/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "William Zabka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089393/characters/nm0951420?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Greg Tolan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000145/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sherilyn Fenn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089393/characters/nm0000145?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sandy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0343325/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Arye Gross"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089393/characters/nm0343325?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Willie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0153385/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Stuart Charno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089393/characters/nm0153385?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Reptile"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0863024/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kenneth Tigar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0089393/characters/nm0863024?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mr. Raymaker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0930799/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "J.

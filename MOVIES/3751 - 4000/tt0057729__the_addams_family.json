Father Gomez (John Astin) clears his throat with a sword, mother Morticia (Carolyn Jones) owns several carnivorous plants, and servant Lurch (Ted Cassidy) somberly replies \"You rang?\" whenever someone rings the bell. And of course, there's their pet, a severed hand named Thing. The family spends their days engaging in activities that most would find weird (to be certain, everything that's normal to us is weird to them). For example, Uncle Fester (Jackie Coogan) likes to rest on a bed on nails. They go through their everyday lives (uh, lives?) doing the sorts of things that most people do, just differently (to say the least).\n\nAmong other things, \"The Addams Family\" was actually better than \"The Munsters\" (it was cleverer and not so silly). This truly represented a break from the \"ideal American family\" mold that had previously dominated TV, especially since Gomez and Morticia often got slinky with each other. Definitely watch it whenever it's on (TV Land is currently rerunning it)."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "ABC Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi229556505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNhNDZmNmEtNDg0NS00NDhkLTgyODktZGEwYzY0NzRjMzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNhNDZmNmEtNDg0NS00NDhkLTgyODktZGEwYzY0NzRjMzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The misadventures of a blissfully macabre but extremely loving family.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-24T10:23:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0427700/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carolyn Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057729/characters/nm0427700?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Morticia Addams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1964-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001067/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jackie Coogan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057729/characters/nm0001067?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Uncle Fester"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1964-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0086641/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Marie Blake"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057729/characters/nm0086641?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Grandmama"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1964-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915797/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ken Weatherwax"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057729/characters/nm0915797?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pugsley Addams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1964-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0040014/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Astin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057729/characters/nm0040014?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gomez Addams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1964-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0144252/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ted Cassidy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057729/characters/nm0144252?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lurch"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1964-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0521006/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lisa Loring"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057729/characters/nm0521006?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Wednesday Addams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "64 episodes, 1964-1966"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8521450/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Thing"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057729/characters/nm8521450?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Itself"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 1964-1966"}]}]}

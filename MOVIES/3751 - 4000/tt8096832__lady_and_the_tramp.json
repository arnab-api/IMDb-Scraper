However, I have to agree with some of the other criticisms of the movie. Based on the time in which they set the film, is kinda hard to believe that Jim Dear and Darling would've lived in such a nice house and had so many friends come over for the baby shower. Interracial couples just weren't a thing really in the early 1900s. They just weren't. Not in places where there were riverboats. And maybe it was because I was a kid when I saw the movie The first time, but I never realized that the Siamese cat's song was rude or offensive, but I'm also not Asian so that might contribute to it too. It would've been nice if they'd tried to fix the lyrics for the song rather than scrap it altogether. The thing they replaced it with, and what was UP with the animation of those cats, it was just weird, was unimpressive. I was also confused by their making Jock a girl, though I always thought it was spelled Jaques, I have no problem with it on the whole, it was just an \"oh, I guess he's a girl now, ok.\" But what happened to Beaver?!\n\nOtherwise, still a good movie. I enjoyed it. But I think I'll be sticking to my original animated version whenever I get the urge to watch Lady and the Tramp.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Watch the Trailer!", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3858284313", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZmNGY5YWUtNzk4My00YTk4LWE2NjctNTI2NjBjNzMzMmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWp1c3dyaQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZmNGY5YWUtNzk4My00YTk4LWE2NjctNTI2NjBjNzMzMmFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWp1c3dyaQ@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-10-16T14:30:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1935086/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tessa Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm1935086?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000385/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sam Elliott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm0000385?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Trusty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1847117/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Janelle Mon\u00e1e"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm1847117?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Peg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000317/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Clancy Brown"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm0000317?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Isaac"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6047431/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Roman GianArthur Irvin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm6047431?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rex"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9701900/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jentel Hawkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm9701900?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dame"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9848055/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Aemon Wolf O'Keefe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm9848055?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ollie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4169922/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kiersey Clemons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm4169922?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Darling"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0857620/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Justin Theroux"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm0857620?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tramp"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0421332/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ashley Jensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm0421332?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0938950/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Benedict Wong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm0938950?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bull"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6047429/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nate 'Rocket' Wonder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm6047429?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Devon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2993705/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "James Bentley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm2993705?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chance"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9393139/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ara Storm O'Keefe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm9393139?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dodge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3287038/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Thomas Mann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8096832/characters/nm3287038?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jim Dear"}]}]}

Bruce and Cybill are great, but above all, the writing is among the best I've seen in a television series. The nonstop sledge hammer wit for a full hour makes me laugh out loud every episode. The scenes are always brilliantly constructed, the jokes always intelligent. The writers never got all the credit they deserved, I'm sure. No matter how funny one joke is, there is always a come back line. I think you have to get past the early episodes that were a little more serious. I didn't start watching until around the beginning of '86. \n\nSo much on TV nowadays is either over-the-top dramatic, or toilet humor. No one knows how to just have fun anymore. Moonlighting never forgot that it was just a television show, and it didn't mind poking fun at itself. Some lines that demonstrated this were, \"Two teams [...] with the same story. Either someone's lying or the writers just Xeroxed the other scene\", and, \"What do we do now?\" \"Wrap this up in about 12 minutes so another show can come on the air.\"\n\nAfter David and Maddie got together, then weren't together, then were, how did it end anyway? The show became a bit of a soap opera. But it was always a treat to watch. Everyone mentions Moonlighting's version of \"The Taming of the Shrew.\" Some of my other favorite episodes are \"The Bride of Tupperman\", which ends with a hospital scene chase to 'Dem Bones, \"Symphony in Knocked Flat\" (guest appearance by Don King), \"Yours Very Deadly\" (Burt Viola's first appearance), and both Christmas episodes. And the show wouldn't be complete without the rhymes of Agnes Dipesto. If you aren't that familiar with the show, don't miss your next opportunity to see Moonlighting!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Moonlighting: The Pilot", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1083638041", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODlmMjc2YzktZjEwMi00ZjM4LWFlNmMtYzgxZTFkZTgyNDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODlmMjc2YzktZjEwMi00ZjM4LWFlNmMtYzgxZTFkZTgyNDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Anchor Bay Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:05:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001732/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cybill Shepherd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088571/characters/nm0001732?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maddie Hayes"}, {"url": "#", "name": "66 episodes, 1985-1989"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0064015/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Allyce Beasley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088571/characters/nm0064015?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Agnes DiPesto"}, {"url": "#", "name": "66 episodes, 1985-1989"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000246/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bruce Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088571/characters/nm0000246?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Addison Jr."}, {"url": "#", "name": "66 episodes, 1985-1989"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0035664/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Curtis Armstrong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088571/characters/nm0035664?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Herbert Quentin Viola"}, {"url": "#", "name": "35 episodes, 1986-1989"}]}]}

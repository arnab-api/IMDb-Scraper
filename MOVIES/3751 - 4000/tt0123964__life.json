It's a practice as old as time in Hollywood.  Most of these movies fail miserably.\n\nYou leave the theater thinking `It was funny enough, why couldn't it just stay silly?'  My friends, I'm with you on every page. It's a slippery slope to juggle the two genres.\n\n`Life' is the millionth attempt at warm-hearted comedy. It tries to make you pee your pants with its jokes, and yet slap your emotions around with the drama.  And damn the odds, it fits like a glove. `Life' is also a film that defies much criticism.  You either love stars Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence, or you don't.  I'm in the first category.  As the main characters, the two comedians prove just how valuable they are.  Murphy is coming off a uniquely horrific year. `Dr. Dolittle' was a smash, but a career setback to say the least. `Holy Man' was an unmitigated disaster, but one that didn't effect Murphy with any real damage. The greatest gift `Life' gives to Murphy is a chance to show off range.  Murphy is a very talented actor, and this movie makes you wish he would try a straight drama for once. Murphy can be devastatingly funny. But he can also be very dramatically convincing.  With each new movie, Murphy grows as an actor. I really think he's set for brighter things. Martin Lawrence shares many of the same attributes as Murphy.  He's terribly funny, and yet able to win your heart with a depth most comedians don't have. `Life' has Lawrence with the quieter role.  He uses that chance to provide the film with a backbone. He eventually comes out the best rounded character in the fractured storytelling.  It's a good performance, but even better, it's a brilliant pairing with Eddie Murphy.  The two are seamlessly funny.  Squeezing every moment for comic and emotional juice.  It's refreshing to watch a movie with two actors who seem to be trying something different, all the while living up to previous expectations. Ted Demme is a solid director, a thought that immediately puts me in the minority.  His `Who's The Man?' was a strictly silly romp, but was actually funny. `The Ref' was the critically lauded and sharp black comedy. `Beautiful Girls' is a film that every time I sit down to watch, feels as comfortable as an old cardigan. He's yet to falter in my eyes.  I like his attention to detail, and his gift for trusting his actors. `Life' wouldn't work as well as it does without a specific amount of direction and free will. Demme manages to keep the film on track without ever succumbing to an over-reliance on improv.  The best scenes in `Life' are the quiet ones: the gay inmate who's release from prison provides a dilemma, the passage of time montage, and Lawrence's moment with the freshly baked pies(which is actually comical, but who's counting?).  The film seems like it was longer at one point, but the film on display here really pleased me. I would recommend this film to anybody that has lost faith in Eddie Murphy.------------- 9"}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Life (1999)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1888878873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNDYxZDAtMmUyNy00YzJhLTg4NjUtN2JlY2QwNWFjMDJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNDYxZDAtMmUyNy00YzJhLTg4NjUtN2JlY2QwNWFjMDJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:00:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000552/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eddie Murphy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0123964/characters/nm0000552?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rayford Gibson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0044762/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Obba Babatund\u00e9"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0123964/characters/nm0044762?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Willie Long"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0026364/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anthony Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0123964/characters/nm0026364?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Cookie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0421116/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brent Jennings"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0123964/characters/nm0421116?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hoppin' Bob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0639200/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Miguel A.

The opening with his shadow approaching his outline gives a hint of suspense, but when we see the Master of Suspense offering a slight explanation of what's about to happen, there's no turning back.\n\nOne can see that Hitch - who would have turned 108 yesterday - occasionally used the show to introduce his movies, and did a really clever job with it: one episode featured a woman stealing money (remember in which movie that happened?). Another episode was set on a train (now where did we see a train?) All in all, I would call this the perfect way that any director could get involved in TV, and who else could do it except Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock? You just gotta see it to really get a feel for it. But when you do watch it, just be prepared for what sorts of things you're about to see.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "DVD Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1047576089", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2YzU0YWEtMDE0Ni00NTlkLTgwM2ItMmRhOTA3ZTI4ODE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2YzU0YWEtMDE0Ni00NTlkLTgwM2ItMmRhOTA3ZTI4ODE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Series of unrelated short stories covering elements of crime, horror, drama, and comedy about people of different backgrounds committing murders, suicides, thefts, and other sorts of crime caused by certain motivations, perceived or not.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-17T09:49:35Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000033/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Alfred Hitchcock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0047708/characters/nm0000033?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "268 episodes, 1955-1962"}]}]}

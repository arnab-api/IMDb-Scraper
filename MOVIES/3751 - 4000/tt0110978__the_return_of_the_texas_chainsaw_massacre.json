But underneath it all is the creepy realization that not everybody thinks like you do.  Some of them do things which make no sense to you.  When you step into their reality, you're at their mercy, and you'll never understand exactly why.\n\nThis installment plays the \"why?\" theme to the hilt, eventually copping out somewhat near the end when they should have just left us wondering. Darla is wonderful as Vilmer's girlfriend, alternately getting hung up about seemingly trivial things -- having a quiet dinner for a change -- and goading Vilmer into continuing their twisted, mutually abusive relationship. Vilmer himself has fantastic moments, though none of the actors quite live up to Perensky & Zellweger's standards of convincing nuttiness and terror, respectively.  Though Newmyer is also great in a role which is too small.\n\nOutside of the mayhem, there's some wonderful dialogue, especially the first few lines in the movie: the teacher who simpers around the students and then gripes, \"f*** I hate kids.\"  Heather's friend with the absolutely bizarre mannerisms explaining that the gossip-monger is just trying to cause trouble.  Heather saying that they might end up slaughtered and hidden away in somebody's basement, with Sean retorting, \"that's stupid, the houses around here don't have basements.\"  And finally, my favourite line: \"Too bad about her face, Leather, but you can have her shoes!\"\n\nDespite all the bad press this movie's received, I hope Kim Henkel enjoys what she created as much as I enjoy watching it.  Goofy, funny, real, unreal, terrifying and witty: good job."}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000250/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110978/characters/nm0000250?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0413210/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robert Jacks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110978/characters/nm0413210?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Leatherface Slaughter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0828494/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Joe Stevens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0110978/characters/nm0828494?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "W.E.

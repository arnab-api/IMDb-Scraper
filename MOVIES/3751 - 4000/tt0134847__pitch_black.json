It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group.\n\nThe plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's well-written characters.\n\nThe group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drug-habit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both.\n\nOther thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be.\n\nSo, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pitch Black", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi15073561", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJiYzFiZDMtZTUwZi00ZWVlLTg1OTQtODA3NWQ4MDIwNjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJiYzFiZDMtZTUwZi00ZWVlLTg1OTQtODA3NWQ4MDIwNjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-05-30T00:48:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004874/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Vin Diesel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134847/characters/nm0004874?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard B.

Terrance Stamp stole the show as General Zod and really sold me on the character's arrogance in relation to Earth. This arrogance was best depicted during the whitehouse scene when upon learning that superman would challenge him, he merely retorts \"Who is this imbecile?\". What I liked about the Kryptonians in this movie was that all 3 of them were their own character with differing personalities, something which I felt was lacking in Man of Steel (No disrespect to Michael Shannon). Gene Hackman once again is brilliant as Lex Luthor, although for me he was overshadowed by Zod (Which is OK as Zod is the main villain of the movie).\n\nKen Thorne's score is great and manages to hold up next to the John Williams score of the original.\n\nThe special effects, while appearing dated by todays standards are very good for the time and still look very believable. These effects stood out during Superman's fight with Zodd in Metropolis and with the depiction of the Phantom Zone at the beginning of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately this is the last of the Christopher Reeve Superman movies that was of high quality. If you're planning on watching these movies I would recommend that you watch all 4 at least once, but for every subsequent viewing just watch the first 2.\n\nAlso RIP Mr Snake, all he wanted to do was say hi", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H7M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Superman II", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3346572313", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzNzU5MGUtZThlZS00YjYyLThmOGUtNmE5NjBjZmQ3NjFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzNzU5MGUtZThlZS00YjYyLThmOGUtNmE5NjBjZmQ3NjFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Superman II", "uploadDate": "2012-10-27T03:32:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000432/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gene Hackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081573/characters/nm0000432?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lex Luthor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000885/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ned Beatty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081573/characters/nm0000885?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Otis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235243/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sarah Douglas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081573/characters/nm0235243?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ursa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0641172/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jack O'Halloran"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081573/characters/nm0641172?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Non"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0948772/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Susannah York"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0081573/characters/nm0948772?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0550855/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "E.G.

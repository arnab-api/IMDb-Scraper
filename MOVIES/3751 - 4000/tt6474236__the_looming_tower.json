The disastrous 9/11 tragedy was actually the intentionally consequences by a few people in the CIA.\n\nBut the FBI counter-terrorist chief got one wife and two mistresses? Is this a fact or just a dramatized TV tabloid plot? The guy so loyal and passionate to his job but couldn't control his crotch, never forgot to put his wedding ring back on his finger before entering his home, facing his wife and daughters? What Jeff Daniel portrayed the FBI guy was somehow a very disgusting person, an adulterer to his wife, a very bad and care less phony father to his two daughters, a great lover with strong sexual desire to his mistresses, a guy so deeply in debt over his credit cards limits, way over his allowed official spendings, yet at the same time, a hard-working FBI guy with die-hard passion against the Muslim terrorists; what a controversial and contradictory complex of a modern day Valentino. How he managed this complicated relationships, his ever-changing roles of his life and lifestyles are a must-study Adultery 101 textbook that most of the men who got power and money needed to acquire except the Mormons : ) And, did it also imply that there are more public servants in D.C. just like him?\n\nBy the way, if that evil self-centered woman in Alec Station was true and there's indeed such a real person in reality, I think she should be sentenced to life in prison without parole, and her mentor, the vicious narrow-minded self-serving guy, likewise, if indeed exists, he should be sentenced to prison at least 25 years, and should have fulfilled without early parole. Condi Rice, George Tennet and the guy who fired John O'neill(?), all of these three morons should never have been hired and banned for any public service ever. What a shame that these few people had put America in danger, and the damages, the wounds and the pains caused by these few are not forgivable. Just because of the Saudis are ally, then anything they did and have done the American government would put a blind eye to it has never changed, even in 2018, the current administration again let the Saudi government go by not even recognized they've committed a murdering crime. Business as usual....what a shame.\n\nThis is a well made TV mini series and a most important footnote to the American public, allowing them to understand how a national tragedy and disaster happened and how the aftermath has changed almost everything and everyone not just in America but the whole world; even it was dramatized for a TV series. But sadly, to a concerned few, either America or the American people didn't learn anything from the 9/11 tragedy at all."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 1 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1726527513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFjMjNlNmMtMjExZS00ZDY0LWI1ODEtOGJiNzkzMDBkOTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzFjMjNlNmMtMjExZS00ZDY0LWI1ODEtOGJiNzkzMDBkOTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "\"The Looming Tower\" traces the rising threat of Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda in the late 1990s and how the rivalry between the FBI and CIA during that time may have inadvertently set the path for the tragedy of 9/11.

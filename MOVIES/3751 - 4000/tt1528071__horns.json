What I didn't realise was just how much I was going to enjoy it.\n\nHorns is nothing particularly special, but it has it's merits and I can confidently say I walked away satisfied with what I had watched.\n\nWith a fantastic cast, a gripping storyline and a really quite neat ending I'm not entirely convinced Radcliffe will break free of the Potter curse but this was a good start.\n\nThe Good:\n\nExcellent story \n\nJuno Temple \n\nDavid Morse \n\nThe Bad: \n\nThe \"Potter\" curse was certainly present \n\nThings I learnt from this movie: \n\nWhere Is My Mind? is officially on every movies soundtrack \n\nJuno Temple is allergic to clothing", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Main Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2758716441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMjM1MDU0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA4NTY1MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMjM1MDU0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA4NTY1MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Ig Perrish is accused for the violent rape and killing of his girlfriend, Merrin Williams.

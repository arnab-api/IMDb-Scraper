Having heard nothing about this film and not even knowing of its existence until the film started, I was immediately worried I was about to see a horror film. Hey, I was only ten at the time, when I was still scared of horror movies. But what I ended up seeing was one of the most hilarious movies ever made, a movie that had the entire theater laughing all the way through. We later bought the video, and more recently the DVD, and over the years since it's release I've watched it countless times (the exact number probably somewhere in the 50s or so) and have never grown tired of it.\n\nWhile managing to be both suspenseful and funny at the same time, the film also does a great job after capturing the day-to-day life of a small suburban street, with a variety of characters so simple and life-like, it seems like they could actually live on your own street. The grumpy old guy down the street, the teenager who likes to throw parties while his parents are gown, the guy next door who comes over all the time and mooches food, and the average Everyday Joe who experiences it all at his own pace. The cast is an excellent combination, with everybody working great together, particularly Bruce Dern as the Vietnam vet who always has the right tool for the job and Tom Hanks as the average guy who's curious about his strange new neighbors, but not enough to really want to bother finding out more about them. If you've never seen it, I suggest giving it a look. It really is quite funny and has many quotable lines."}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3296836121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjliOGJjNzQtMDk2Mi00NDNjLTlmYzctYzc3ZGUwMGQ4ODcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjliOGJjNzQtMDk2Mi00NDNjLTlmYzctYzc3ZGUwMGQ4ODcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-10-23T20:10:31Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000158/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Hanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0000158?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ray Peterson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000402/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carrie Fisher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0000402?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Carol Peterson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000397/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Corey Feldman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0000397?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ricky Butler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002099/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Henry Gibson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0002099?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dr. Werner Klopek"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0301381/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Courtney Gains"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0301381?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hans Klopek"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0588241/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dick Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0588241?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Garbageman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0200761/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Cory Danziger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0200761?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dave Peterson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397555/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rance Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0397555?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Detective"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001136/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bruce Dern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0001136?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mark Rumsfield"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0239958/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rick Ducommun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0239958?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Art Weingartner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0769446/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Wendy Schaal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0769446?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bonnie Rumsfield"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0857475/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Theodore Gottlieb"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0857475?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Reuben Klopek"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0330198/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gale Gordon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0330198?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Walter Seznick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000585/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Robert Picardo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0000585?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Garbageman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0014977/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Franklyn Ajaye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096734/characters/nm0014977?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Detective"}]}]}

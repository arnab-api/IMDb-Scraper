I had the hugest crush on Spot Conlon. It's hard to find faults in a movie like that. How you feel about this movie will probably depend on how receptive you are to it. Chances are, you'll have one of two reactions while watching \"Newsies\". One: \"I can't believe I'm watching a musical about newsboys.\" Two: \"I freakin' *love* this movie.\"\n\nYep, I'm with the latter group. My interest in Newsies was revived when I picked up the soundtrack lately. The music is well written, and infectiously engaging. If you don't like musicals, you're not going to like this film. If you do like musical, I defy you to not like it.\n\nSome parts, yes, are a bit hokey. It's a Disney flick, and by definition, is kid friendly. (A lyrics sampling: \"And we'll kick their rear!\" \"They gave their word, but it ain't worth beans.\") But the characters are great (and I'm not just talkin' 'bout Spot). The dynamic between Jack and Davey is great. And even though the cussin' is bland, it's still a story of young kids living in an adult world, facing adult problems with teen angst. That's good stuff. Plus, Robert Duvall's in it. Come on.\n\n\"Newsies\" kind of got pushed aside after release. As an afterthought, it's interesting to wonder, with the new interest in musicals thanks to \"Chicago\", if the reception would be different if it were released today. No matter. As evidenced by the comments here, people enjoy it.

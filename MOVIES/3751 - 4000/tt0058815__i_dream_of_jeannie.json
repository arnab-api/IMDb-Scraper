Which is a beautiful knockout blonde female like Jeannie and anything else desired. This is really a timeless masterpiece. The problem with Nelson is he seemed too wrapped up in his astronaut duties/career that he seem to take for granted the appealing female Genie. I bet a lot of guys watching the show would had no problem or hesitation in wanting Jeannie for themselves. When it came to Jeannie, Nelson made me feel like I wish I could go up to him and POW right in the arm for being so blind to her. It's funny but I didn't realize until now, after all these years, that the name Jeannie matches what she was... which is a Genie. Barbara Eden will always be the Genie of our dreams!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "I Dream of Jeannie: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4170187033", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJhMGViZTYtYjBiYy00ZThlLTliNDctOWEzM2I4Y2MzOGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJhMGViZTYtYjBiYy00ZThlLTliNDctOWEzM2I4Y2MzOGI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:41:56Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001174/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Barbara Eden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058815/characters/nm0001174?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeannie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "139 episodes, 1965-1970"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0197349/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bill Daily"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058815/characters/nm0197349?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Major Roger Healey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "131 episodes, 1965-1970"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001306/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Larry Hagman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058815/characters/nm0001306?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Major Anthony Nelson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "139 episodes, 1965-1970"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0740718/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hayden Rorke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058815/characters/nm0740718?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Alfred Bellows"}, {"url": "#", "name": "129 episodes, 1965-1970"}]}]}

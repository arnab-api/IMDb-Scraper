Seeing Hiccup and Toothless not together is just... it doesn't feel right. Tamed once - tamed forever. And letting dragons go is like throwing your favourite pet cat or dog into the wild. Not only Toothless but also all other dragons that lived on Berk wouldn't be scared of humans and if they meet someone who has never seen dragons....\n\nThe story was mainly concentrated on Zephyr and yet again as in Hiccup's case, she changed her mind when she actually saw Toothless and understood that he wasn't a thread. Well, maybe not exactly the same case, but the idea is the same: seeing and understanding that the thing is not quite what you think of it to be.\n\nSo I don't think that without dragons Berkians would be able to preserve that love and care that hey had when dragons lived with them. Slowly in a couple of generations everything would return to the beginning when people were terrified of dragons and hunted them.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT22M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0059431/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jay Baruchel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm0059431?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hiccup"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0272401/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Craig Ferguson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm0272401?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gobber"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2395586/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Christopher Mintz-Plasse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm2395586?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Fishlegs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3994945/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Zack Pearlman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm3994945?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Snotlout"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5004187/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Justin Rupple"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm5004187?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tuffnut"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1065229/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "America Ferrera"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm1065229?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Astrid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8655200/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Madalyn Gonzalez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm8655200?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Zephyr"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3185369/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Liam Ferguson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm3185369?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nuffink"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124930/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gerard Butler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11112140/characters/nm0124930?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Stoick"}]}]}

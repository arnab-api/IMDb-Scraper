If you are new to this show, I would recommend reading Season 1 reviews as they may be more useful to you.\n\nWhile I won't go into any specific details to avoid spoilers, I will simply say that Season 2 is fantastic, and a real pleasure to experience. If you enjoyed Season 1, or even thought Season 1 was \"pretty good but nothing special\", you have to see Season 2. It is truly amazing. Everything was just incredible, the art, the backgrounds, the music, the fight scenes were INCREDIBLY good and high quality, the story was amazingly well rounded with tons of development, backstory, and mysteries still left to unveil.\n\nBut most importantly, the true beauty of the show really shined again this Season, and that was the characters. The dialogue is just superb. I particularly love Soren's character, and just how much life he breathes into every scene he's in. All the new characters are fantastic, and one of them in particular has a voice of GOLD (you'll know what I mean when you watch the season). I wouldn't go through every character that were great because truly they all were, but Callum, Rayla, Ezren, Claudia and Soren had some fantastic scenes in this season.\n\nThe animation has gotten so much better, it is very smooth and flows very very well. While I never had a problem with Season 1's animation, if that ever bugged you, this newer Season has completely removed all of the stuttering and frame problems.\n\nNow what are you still doing here?

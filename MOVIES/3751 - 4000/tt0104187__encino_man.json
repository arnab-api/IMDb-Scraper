(er, by that I mean it HAS...)\n\nI was a bit like the Sean Astin character when I was at school. If only I'd had a caveman of my own to help me pull chicks, how differently things might have turned out...\n\nOkay, so the movie has no basis in reality, but who would expect it to? Cavemen aside, it's a TEEN movie, and they NEVER depict real people or situations. At least, not on any planet I've ever been to. \n\nThis movie doesn't pretend to be anything outstanding. It's intended purely as entertainment, and that's what it is.\n\nIt appears to have been promoted as one of those frightful \"Pauly Shore movies\", but it's not. He's really just a supporting player (and is nowhere near as annoying in small doses, it turns out). This is Brendan Fraser's flick. If anyone else had played Link, I can't imagine the movie being as good as it is.\n\nMy one beef is that Sandra Hess (\"Cave Nug\") wasn't given enough screen time (but then, as far as I'm concerned, she's NEVER given enough screen time).\n\nI never knew Scatterbrain had covered \"Mama Said Knock You Out\", either. That's cool.\n\nOkay, I'm going for a lie down now.\n\nBye.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Encino Man", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi648347929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWVmZjM1NGMtNTBlOC00NWQ1LWIxNWItMTM5OTlhOTkyYzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWVmZjM1NGMtNTBlOC00NWQ1LWIxNWItMTM5OTlhOTkyYzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Buena Vista Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:00:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000276/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sean Astin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0000276?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dave"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001736/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Pauly Shore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0001736?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stoney Brown"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000677/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robin Tunney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0000677?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ella"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0887187/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Patrick Van Horn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0887187?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Phil, Matt's Thug #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0239958/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rick Ducommun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0239958?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Brush"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0366866/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mariette Hartley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0366866?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mrs. Morgan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0086111/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ellen Blain"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0086111?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Teena Morgan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0253894/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Steven Elkins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0253894?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mr. Beady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000409/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Brendan Fraser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0000409?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Link"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0911725/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Megan Ward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0911725?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robyn Sweeney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0217937/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael DeLuise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0217937?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Matt Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416390/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dalton James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0416390?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Will, Matt's Thug #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0702841/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ke Huy Quan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0702841?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kim"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0557956/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Richard Masur"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0557956?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mr. Morgan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0779126/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Esther Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0104187/characters/nm0779126?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mrs. Mackey"}]}]}

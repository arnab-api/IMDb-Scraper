I think this third entry in the series is almost unanimously \u2013 and righteously \u2013 labeled as THE best Bond movie of all. It's definitely also the most quintessential title to watch in order to get fully acquainted with the lead character's personality and working methods, as well as with the type of assignments he receives from his employer, his opponents and the hi- tech attributes he gets to help him. You'd expect all this to become clear already in the first film, \"Dr. No\", but the character created by Ian Fleming was still fairly unknown back then and hence the production values were a lot lower. Barely two years and only one sequel later, James Bond had already become a phenomenon and \"Goldfinger\" delivered the incredibly high expectations of the fans. It truly also is a terrific film, with an utmost solid script, a top three legendary villain and various highly memorable action & suspense sequences. Personally, I have the bizarre habit of ranking my favorite Bond movies based on the evil- factor and charisma of the villains, and thus \"Goldfinger\" is quite high up there thanks to the sublime roles of Gert Fr\u00f6be as the titular character and Harold Sakata as Oddjob, his silent but deadly henchman who pulverizes golf balls with his bare hands and throws around his killer-hat of steel. The gold-obsessed magnate has thought up an ingenious plan to rob the entire American gold supply from Fort Knox and naturally it's 007's job to prevent this from happening. Therefore Bond infiltrates into Goldfinger's private affairs twice; messing up his game cheating routines and seducing his female accomplices. Auric Goldfinger is undoubtedly one of the most vicious Bond-villains, but arguably also one of the dumbest! Never before or after did 007's opponents receive so many open and easy chances to eliminate him, but Goldfinger decides not to take the risk and kill his disloyal female assistants instead! Many, many sequences in this third Bond film are pure vintage, including the white tuxedo underneath the diving suit, Shirley Eaton's golden corpse, an uncomfortable laser beam moment and \u2013 of course \u2013 every scene with that awesome Aston Martin!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Goldfinger", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2383218457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Goldfinger", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T15:17:52Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000125/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sean Connery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0000125?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "James Bond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000303/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Honor Blackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0000303?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Pussy Galore"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0539965/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tania Mallet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0539965?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tilly Masterson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0496866/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bernard Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0496866?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "'M'"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0511695/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Cec Linder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0511695?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Felix Leiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561755/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lois Maxwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0561755?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Moneypenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0577996/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michael Mellinger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0577996?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kisch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0716605/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nadja Regin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0716605?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bonita"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002085/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gert Fr\u00f6be"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0002085?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Goldfinger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0247881/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shirley Eaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0247881?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jill Masterson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0757138/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Harold Sakata"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0757138?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Oddjob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0072578/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Martin Benson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0072578?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Solo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0932270/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Austin Willis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0932270?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Simmons"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0619440/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bill Nagy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0619440?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Midnight"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186526/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter Cranwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058150/characters/nm0186526?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Johnny"}]}]}

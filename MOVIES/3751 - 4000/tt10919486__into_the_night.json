It's almost as if a 5th grader read the book, then wrote the screenplay. I'm sure some context was lost in the dubbed translations, but still, the obvious plot and conceptual issues failed this series from being just as great as the concept.\n\nAside from the writing, the low budget setting was used exceptionally well. The directing was on point, and the cinematography was excellent. The approximately 30 minute episodes were a comfortable length, and the pacing was just right.\n\nAll this, impressive for a low budget international Belgium-made series. Even with its writing flaws, it's still a well deserved 8/10 from me.\n\nI hope Netflix throws in more money for the second season, to improve the flaws and execution on this already great concept, as it did for Money Heist.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Teaser Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2577055257", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU0ZjU0M2QtYWEyYy00M2JiLWJlMzQtNzU5NzM3ZDhlZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU0ZjU0M2QtYWEyYy00M2JiLWJlMzQtNzU5NzM3ZDhlZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The sun inexplicably starts killing everything in its path but 'lucky' passengers and crew of an overnight flight out of Brussels, as they attempt to fly west - into the safety of the dark night.", "uploadDate": "2020-03-27T05:41:08Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3011788/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Pauline Etienne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm3011788?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sylvie Bridgette Dubois"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0476011/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mehmet Kurtulus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm0476011?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ayaz Kobanbay"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0082052/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jan Bijvoet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm0082052?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richard 'Rik' Mertens"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1711617/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Vincent Londez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm1711617?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Horst Baudin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2031248/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alba Ga\u00efa Bellugi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm2031248?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ines M\u00e9lanie Ricci"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11579175/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nicolas Alechine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm11579175?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dominik"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2182605/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Astrid Whettnall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm2182605?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Gabrielle Renoir"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8732548/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "James McElvar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm8732548?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Freddie"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0135084/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laurent Capelluto"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm0135084?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mathieu Daniel Douek"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3447751/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Babetida Sadjo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm3447751?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Laura Djalo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2337388/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ksawery Szlenkier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm2337388?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jakub Kieslowski"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10865837/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Regina Bikkinina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm10865837?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Zara Oblonskaya"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4798385/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Nabil Mallat"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm4798385?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Osman Azizi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0144126/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Stefano Cassetti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm0144126?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Terenzio Matteo Gallo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5209998/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Brian Slayne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10919486/characters/nm5209998?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Schultz"}, {"url": "#", "name": "4 episodes, 2020"}]}]}

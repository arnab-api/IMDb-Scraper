The premise of the film is based on a true story that sees the first conviction of a murder by an FBI agent. Main Character Emilia Clarke fresh off her turn as Daenerys on Game Of Thrones plays the lead here and she is okay here. She delivers a strong emotional performance and she actually delivers her a Kentucky accent pretty well here. The issue is just her character is totally unlikable and hard to root for, the film tries to make you care and I just never really did despite her quite strong performance. Supporting Characters It's funny that Johnny Knoxville is just the Jackass guy and he is in this film and I actually thought he was pretty decent here. He is crazy when he needs to be and very intense, the humour isn't there and it works for his character and shows that maybe he could have a future as a more dramatic actor. Jack Huston plays the FBI Agent here and he didn't really do anything for me, it felt like he could have just been played by anybody and they would have done a decent role which is a letdown. The rest of the people here don't provide much to the film as this feels like the Emilia Clarke show here.\n\nStory The story here was a letdown to me and wasn't particularly interesting. As I said earlier Clarke's character is just pretty unlikable and it really took me out of the film. The chemistry between Clarke and Huston also wasn't there for me and the overall plot just didn't provide much of interest at all and with a film like this the story has to be well done and this film fails miserably.\n\nScript The script was a mixed bag, there was some decent dramatic moments pretty much all from Clarke. But the majority of time it doesn't hit the dramatic moments that it thinks it does and it misses its mark more times then it hits.\n\nStyle The style of the film has some pretty dark and intense moments to it that will make you feel uncomfortable which the film achieves well. But this film is really slow paced, which lulled me almost to sleep and in just the visual style it looks very cheap and dull looking.\n\nOverall Overall, this is a pretty forgettable film. It isn't an interesting story and though not terrible I would advise to skip this one this week.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3758210585", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODgxNWFjNjItYmQ4YS00NTJlLWJjMTktYmU4MWZhMjZiNTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODgxNWFjNjItYmQ4YS00NTJlLWJjMTktYmU4MWZhMjZiNTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A hot shot rookie FBI agent is sent to Kentucky, where he's drawn into an illicit affair with a local woman who becomes his star informant.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-07T06:42:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3592338/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Emilia Clarke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm3592338?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Susan Smith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2998321/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sophie Lowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm2998321?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kathy Putnam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3332884/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Austin H\u00e9bert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm3332884?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Randy McCoy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3194762/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Karl Glusman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm3194762?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joe-Bea"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0291368/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Brian Lee Franklin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm0291368?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rufus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0611889/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chris Mulkey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm0611889?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Todd Eason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6845927/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Luke Spencer Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm6845927?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7772456/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Landon Durrence"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm7772456?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Susan's Son"}, {"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm7772456?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Isom Smith"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1658935/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jack Huston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm1658935?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mark"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424216/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Johnny Knoxville"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm0424216?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000301/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Thora Birch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm0000301?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jolene"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242656/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Kevin Dunn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm0242656?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bob Singer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0589077/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Omar Benson Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm0589077?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Denver Rhodes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6239256/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Brittany O'Grady"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm6239256?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Georgia Beale"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4629997/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lex Kelli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt5688068/characters/nm4629997?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Susan's Daughter"}]}]}

Although Keira Knightley's performance is slightly off-putting due to the fact she appears like she just escaped from a concentration camp (surely young British socialites did not look like this in the 1930's), the stunning cast shows full range here racing through curious emotions: spite, lust, recklessness, and selfish wanton abandon. The facial expressions, especially from the children in the early scenes on the estate, are priceless. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic as they are often vain, self-absorbed, and quite silly in their drama, but they are fascinating to watch. The first third of the film is played like a \"Masterpiece Theater\" production of \"The Great Gatsby\" as seen through the eyes of Nancy Drew.\n\nHowever, what makes \"Atonement\" soar is the impeccable direction of Joe Wright. He makes the most audacious coming-of-age as an auteur since Anthony Minghella delivered \"The English Patient\" back in 1996. Wright displays a near Kubrickian mastery of sound effects (notice the strikes of the typewriter keys) that transition from scene to scene and often bleed into the amazing score from Dario Marianelli. Wright also crafts a finely textured mise-en-scene that visually translates McEwan's richly composed story onto the screen with near note perfect fashion. Nothing can really prepare you for how well directed this film is until you see it, and the scene of the three soldiers arriving on the beach at the Dunkirk evacuation is one of the greatest stand alone unedited panning long shots ever captured on film. It left me gasping.\n\nThat scene leads to the heart of the film. The often clich\u00e9d romance at the core is trumped by Wright's depiction of Robbie, a single man forlorn and obsessed, his dizzying inner turmoil reflected against the grand canvas of a chaotic world at war. Likewise, Briony's redemption comes not in the too-clever conclusion at the end of the film, but in the intimate and symbolic confessional at the bedside of a dying French soldier. These moments leave lasting impressions, and left me imagining that if Joe Wright were to ever adapt Irene Nemiorovsky's \"Suite Francaise\" onto the silver screen, he would knock it so far out of the park it would leave \"Gone With Wind\" spinning in its gilded Hollywood grave.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Atonement", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3836805401", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg", "description": "Atonement trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-11-21T13:47:43Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1519680/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Saoirse Ronan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm1519680?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Briony Tallis, aged 13"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000950/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brenda Blethyn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm0000950?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Grace Turner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0564215/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "James McAvoy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm0564215?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robbie Turner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461136/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Keira Knightley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm0461136?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cecilia Tallis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2328584/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Felix von Simson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm2328584?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Pierrot Quincey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0654295/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Alfie Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm0654295?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Danny Hardman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1212722/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Benedict Cumberbatch"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm1212722?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Paul Marshall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2852111/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Leander Deeny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm2852111?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Police Constable"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2854564/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ailidh Mackay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm2854564?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Singing Housemaid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0922169/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Julia West"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm0922169?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Betty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910040/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Harriet Walter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm0910040?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Emily Tallis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1017334/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Juno Temple"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm1017334?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lola Quincey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2335109/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Charlie von Simson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm2335109?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jackson Quincey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1171145/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Patrick Kennedy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm1171145?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Leon Tallis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0927835/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Peter Wight"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0783233/characters/nm0927835?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Police Inspector"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK", "France", "USA"], "Language": ["English", "French"], "Release Date": ["11 January 2008 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Atonement"], "Filming Locations": ["South Tees Development Corporation Steelworks, Redcar, North Yorkshire, England, UK"], "Budget": ["$30,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$784,145,", "9 December 2007"], "Gross USA": ["$50,927,067"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$131,016,624"], "Production Co": ["Universal Pictures", "StudioCanal", "Relativity Media"], "Runtime": ["123 min"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

It sticks pretty much to the source material story-wise. Almost all of the original is replicated here but a few new wrinkles were thrown into the mix mostly having to do with Jupiter's clan and their origins. A little bit of a political slant is thrown in for good measure but it's not awfully heavy-handed and most will glance over it. The remake turns up the style quite a bit over the original no surprise considering the better budget and change in directors. The gore got bumped up significantly and the family looks more disgusting than ever. Now for the big question, how does it stack up to the original?. I say it did pretty well. The original had it's flaws as well as this one but I think they were both done honestly and Aja did an excellent job trying to pay homage to the original and breathe more life into it. The acting is as good as you'd expect with a pretty good cast. Lovers of the original should be OK with it, I am.\n\nBoth the original and the remake score a 7.5 or 8 on my scale.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Hills Have Eyes (2006)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2750611737", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZkMzAwNDAtMjM2My00OTZlLTgzMDktZjdkN2NkYzkyYWJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZkMzAwNDAtMjM2My00OTZlLTgzMDktZjdkN2NkYzkyYWJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:46:52Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2192005/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Maxime Giffard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm2192005?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "First Victim"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0101005/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tom Bower"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0101005?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Gas Station Attendant"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000599/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kathleen Quinlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0000599?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ethel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0211087/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Emilie de Ravin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0211087?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brenda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005416/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Vinessa Shaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0005416?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lynn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0431451/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Robert Joy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0431451?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lizard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0125653/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ezra Buzzington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0125653?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Goggle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0630524/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Greg Nicotero"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0630524?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cyst"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809344/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Bailey Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0809344?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pluto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0505971/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ted Levine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0505971?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Big Bob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0126004/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dan Byrd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0126004?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bobby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0822155/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Aaron Stanford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0822155?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Doug"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1993877/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Maisie Camilleri Preziosi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm1993877?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Baby Catherine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1925026/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Laura Ortiz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm1925026?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ruby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236711/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Billy Drago"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0454841/characters/nm0236711?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Papa Jupiter"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["10 March 2006 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Hills Have Eyes"], "Filming Locations": ["CLA Studios, Morocco"], "Budget": ["$15,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$15,708,512,", "12 March 2006"], "Gross USA": ["$41,778,863"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$70,009,308"], "Production Co": ["Craven-Maddalena Films", "Dune Entertainment", "Major Studio Partners"], "Runtime": ["107 min", "108 min", "(unrated)"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "SDDS", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

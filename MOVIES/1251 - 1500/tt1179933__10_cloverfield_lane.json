(NO SPOILERS)", "reviewBody": "First of all, if you want to watch '10 Cloverfield Lane', make sure to avoid any kind of spoilers on the internet. I will try to write this review without spoilers, even if it's a bit difficult considering the movie I just witnessed.\n\n'10 Cloverfield Lane' is an amazing mystery/suspense movie that serves as a sequel to the 2008 hit 'Cloverfield'. I have to say, it's hard to tell if the greatness of this movie is going to hold up in 10 years because of how everything surrounding the movie made it better, but I really really liked it.\n\nMe and my friend tried to avoid the spoilers on the internet and read as less as possible on the movie before we went to see it. Fortunately, the brilliant marketing campaign did not reveal anything about the story, and the fact that it was a sequel to 'Cloverfield' is going to make you constantly guess. Is it a traditional horror/suspense movie? Is it a monster movie? Where are the monsters? WHAT IS GOING? (Pretty much what I kept asking myself all along the movie)\n\nJohn Goodman was incredible, definitely the standout of this movie. The soundtrack was great, some jukebox oldies and a thrilling score.\n\nThe movie starts with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) driving off from her marriage and taking the road to leave her husband. This is made with a perfect montage, and there's no dialogue for the first 4-5 minutes of the movie. Then, things take a turn and we are transported to the bunker you saw in the trailers.\n\nI will say it again, go watch this film, and don't read anything about it on the internet. I can't recall the last time a movie kept me guessing like this one. If you tend to get bored and tired by the usual clich\u00e9s in movies, buy your ticket to '10 Cloverfield Lane' and enjoy your time at the movies.\n\nClever marketing, brilliant story, very good direction, great performance by the cast, it's hard to complain about this film!\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2229122329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIxMTU4NTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMTMwODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIxMTU4NTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMTMwODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Waking up from a car accident, a young woman finds herself in the basement of a man who says he's saved her life from a chemical attack that has left the outside uninhabitable.", "uploadDate": "2016-02-16T12:12:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000422/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Goodman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179933/characters/nm0000422?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Howard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0302330/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "John Gallagher Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179933/characters/nm0302330?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Emmett"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0190550/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Suzanne Cryer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179933/characters/nm0190550?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0599019/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sumalee Montano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179933/characters/nm0599019?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Voice on Radio"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935541/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mary Elizabeth Winstead"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1179933/characters/nm0935541?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michelle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0341174/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Douglas M.

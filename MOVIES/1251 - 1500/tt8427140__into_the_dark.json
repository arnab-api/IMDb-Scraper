This 1:33 minute episode is very well acted . The limited characters (Diana Silvers as Kimberly, and Dermot Mulroney as her father) are well casted, and comfortably take command, guiding the story along.. \"Flesh & Blood\" shows that maybe Into the Dark is worth sticking around a whole year for. \"Flesh & Blood\" is a more conventional thriller, but its deft execution doesn't let it feel stale. \"Flesh & Blood\" takes its time setting up its characters and conflict, but once it gets going it doesn't stop. Very good thriller.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1670496281", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNjZGFmYjMtMWFmYi00MDZhLTk4YmItNDEyYjQxMmFkNzZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNjZGFmYjMtMWFmYi00MDZhLTk4YmItNDEyYjQxMmFkNzZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "Esme and her 10 year old son, Luna, move to a small desert town looking for a fresh start but as locals begin to probe, Esme must battle to protect her son and a terrifying secret before the full moon exposes them.", "uploadDate": "2021-03-16T17:24:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4563780/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aurora Perrineau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8427140/characters/nm4563780?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ashley Prime"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4003553/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dylan Arnold"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8427140/characters/nm4003553?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hank"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2019-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0378002/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sonita Henry"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8427140/characters/nm0378002?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. Larson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2019-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0783343/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Diane Sellers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8427140/characters/nm0783343?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Casting Director"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3444884/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Katie Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt8427140/characters/nm3444884?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Christine"}, {"url": "#", "name": "2 episodes, 2018-2019"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["5 October 2018 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Into the Dark"], "Production Co": ["Blumhouse Television", "Hulu"], "Runtime": ["90 min"]}}

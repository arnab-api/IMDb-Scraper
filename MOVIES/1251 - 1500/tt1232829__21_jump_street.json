The concept is a bit interesting. At first glance, this movie looks like it's just another mediocre raucous comedy, but it turns out to be a clever one. It's quite a surprise. It stays loyal to its roots except it added some raunchiness and slapstick humor to the story. It's a new kind of 21 Jump Street that is much more fun.\n\nI'm not saying it's better than the TV series though. Both are pretty interesting but this one is definitely aiming as a comedy. The film is just crazy stuff with crazy characters living in an absurd setting. The original premise remains but with some buddy comedy elements, and raunchy and slapstick humor. Surprisingly, it works better to the plot. The humor is clever and quite hilarious. These jokes are greatly executed by the stars. Jonah Hill is always a brilliant comedian. Channing Tatum finally plays a none bland character. His chemistry with Hill shines to the film. While the others, Ice Cube hams it up a little but he can provide some laughs. Rob Riggle is just being Rob Riggle. Dave Franco's role here kind of reminds me of his role in Fright Night but he's pretty good with it.\n\nThe direction is snappy and stylish. The action is fun but I don't think anybody cares about that. The main point of this film is High School and the relationship between Schmidt and Jenko. It shows how the new high school turned their lives upside down. They can't stop playing with their antics on their mission. There is a drama between them. Most of it played as a joke but the heart is always there.\n\nAll turns out to be pretty well in this film even with all the changes and the absurdity. It's smart, sweet, hilarious, and fun. The fans of the TV series may still get a surprise while they miss the none mad Captain Jenko and the charms of the show. This film is too crazy and absurd but in a clever way. I haven't enjoyed a comedy like this in a while. 21 Jump Street is undeniably fun and it's probably one of the best comedies of the year.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1681366553", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzI4MDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE4MDIwNw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzI4MDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE4MDIwNw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A pair of underachieving cops are sent back to a local high school in order to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring.", "uploadDate": "2011-11-08T10:59:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1706767/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jonah Hill"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm1706767?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Schmidt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0488953/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brie Larson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm0488953?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Molly Tracey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1443527/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rob Riggle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm1443527?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mr. Walters"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001084/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ice Cube"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm0001084?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Captain Dickson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0663177/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chris Parnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm0663177?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mr. Gordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2159926/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jake Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm2159926?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Principal Dadier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005372/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Holly Robinson Peete"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm0005372?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Officer Judy Hoffs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3197294/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Stanley Wong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm3197294?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Roman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1475594/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Channing Tatum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm1475594?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jenko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2002649/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dave Franco"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm2002649?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Eric Molson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1154986/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "DeRay Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm1154986?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Domingo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3967702/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dax Flame"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm3967702?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Zack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2608689/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ellie Kemper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm2608689?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ms. Griggs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0644406/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nick Offerman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm0644406?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Deputy Chief Hardy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2922572/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Johnny Pemberton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1232829/characters/nm2922572?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Delroy"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["16 March 2012 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["21 Jump Street"], "Filming Locations": ["Riverdale High School, Jefferson, Louisiana, USA"], "Budget": ["$42,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$36,302,612,", "18 March 2012"], "Gross USA": ["$138,447,667"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$201,585,328"], "Production Co": ["Columbia Pictures", "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)", "Relativity Media"], "Runtime": ["109 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Datasat", "SDDS", "Dolby Surround 7.1", "Dolby Atmos"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

Most of the time that is a little annoying, although there are moments it adds something to the scary events that happen. I am not a big fan of the horror-genre, although I can appreciate it when it is done good. Here you have no real story, but there are some real scares. Since it is about ghosts those things can turn up anytime and anywhere. One of the characters even explains that \"they like to do that\".\n\nTo explain the story would be quite pointless. What I can say is that a family without a mother but including dad Arthur (Tony Shalhboub), daughter Kathy (Shannon Elizabeth), son Bobby (Alec Roberts) and nanny Maggie (Rah Digga) inherits a strange house, created by their uncle Cyrus (F. Murray Abraham). We learn that Cyrus was a ghost hunter, of course with a purpose and a thirteenth ghost as the answer to a mystery, and that twelve ghosts are locked in the basement of the house. Two other characters are in the house as well. Dennis (Matthew Lillard) who sees future and past when he touches people and who used to work with Cyrus, and an opponent of Cyrus named Kalina (Embeth Davidtz). When the ghosts are unleashed they have to save themselves.\n\nI realize I actually have told you the story, but that is not what this movie is about. What makes it at least interesting is the visual style of the movie. The house looks great, the effects and art direction are very admirable. That there is hardly time to notice that is a shame. The scares might be stupid but they work enough to make this a real horror movie. Yes, there are many flaws and things go terribly wrong near the end, but if you normally like these kind of movies, you must be able to enjoy 'Thir13en Ghosts'.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H31M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Thirteen Ghosts", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4193648921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyYjEzZWQtMjU0OC00ODRmLTljZWUtMzVkMDEzY2FmMjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyYjEzZWQtMjU0OC00ODRmLTljZWUtMzVkMDEzY2FmMjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:57:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001724/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tony Shalhoub"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0001724?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Arthur Kriticos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000498/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matthew Lillard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0000498?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dennis Rafkin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0730809/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alec Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0730809?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robert 'Bobby' Kriticos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226497/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rah Digga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0226497?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maggie Bess"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0365755/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Matthew Harrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0365755?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Damon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0187613/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mike Crestejo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0187613?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Team Member"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0028136/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Charles Andre"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0028136?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Team Member"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0921738/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Daniel Wesley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0921738?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jimmy 'The Gambler' Gambino, The Torso"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001110/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Embeth Davidtz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0001110?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kalina Oretzia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002436/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shannon Elizabeth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0002436?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kathy Kriticos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0100068/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "JR Bourne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0245674/characters/nm0100068?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Benjamin Moss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000719/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "F.

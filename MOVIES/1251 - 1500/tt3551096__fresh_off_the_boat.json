Not only because it is paving the way for more diversity in the industry, but also because it is a hilarious and charming show. I found myself laughing out loud a various points throughout the episodes and throughly enjoyed getting to know these characters. Regarding to the reviews consisting of complaints about the show's racism toward white people (groan), these viewers are missing the point of the show. This show is portraying what is was like, and still is like for that matter, for Asian families being the minority and the racism THEY face. Yes, the show takes some jabs at Caucasians, but that's hardly racism. It is actually impossible to be racist toward white people, as racism only applies when institutional power or privilege is involved. Since White people have the most privilege in this country, it's impossible to be racist against a white person, or rather nearly impossible. Yes, you can be prejudice toward white, people, but this show is definitely not prejudice. So please don;t write this show off because it's \"being racist toward white people.\" I would like to end this review by saying that I am thoroughly pleased that there is finally a show with multiple Asian actors as its main characters. Although one day, I hope there can be shows not specifically about AN Asian American FAMILY, but rather a family that just happens to be Asian. Because yes, there's a difference. Race aside, this show is a refreshing comedy and is definitely unique. It should appeal to all audiences, as long as they keep an open mind. I would be very sad if this show were to get canceled.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fresh Off the Boat: The Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3738351641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJmODI0NTYtYzBmMy00ZWNhLTg3NDYtNGI2MTM2OGNmNTliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJmODI0NTYtYzBmMy00ZWNhLTg3NDYtNGI2MTM2OGNmNTliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Series Trailer", "uploadDate": "2018-02-01T17:08:21Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1320827/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Randall Park"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm1320827?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Louis Huang"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6386589/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hudson Yang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm6386589?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eddie Huang"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6373728/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ian Chen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm6373728?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Evan Huang"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1908148/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chelsey Crisp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm1908148?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Honey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "109 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4776259/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Trevor Larcom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm4776259?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Trent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "70 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2090422/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Constance Wu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm2090422?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jessica Huang"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5549251/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Forrest Wheeler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm5549251?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Emery Huang"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0814586/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lucille Soong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm0814586?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Grandma Huang"}, {"url": "#", "name": "115 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0936403/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ray Wise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm0936403?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Marvin"}, {"url": "#", "name": "91 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6056726/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Evan Hannemann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3551096/characters/nm6056726?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Barefoot Dave"}, {"url": "#", "name": "51 episodes, 2015-2020"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["4 February 2015 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Fresh Off the Boat"], "Filming Locations": ["20th Century Fox Studios - 10201 Pico Blvd., Century City, Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["Fierce Baby Productions", "The Detective Agency", "20th Century Fox Television"], "Runtime": ["22 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

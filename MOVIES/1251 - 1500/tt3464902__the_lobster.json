MUST SEE...", "reviewBody": "Being a Yorgos Lanthimos virgin, I was attracted to the title by its quirky premise and interesting cast list. I approached with cautious optimism, hoping to find a gem at the very least. What I found instead was a cinematic treasure trove.\n\nThe Lobster follows David (Colin Farrel) in a society where it is unacceptable to be single. When David's wife leaves him he is sent to The Hotel where he has 45 days to find a partner. If he finds one - awesome. If he fails, he will be turned into an animal. Of his choice, naturally.\n\nIt's stylish, it's got technique, it's disorienting (in a good way), it asks questions about us and doesn't really care about hearing our answers. It instills within you the great sense of uneasiness that the characters must feel in this collection of increasingly odd situations through stilted, brutally frank dialogue in a masterclass of a script. The performances, also, are stunning. I was pleasantly surprised by Rachel Weisz in her subtly moving role as the Short Sighted Woman.\n\nHaving watched it no more than five hours ago, I find myself recalling it as if it was a dream. The carefully considered combination of editing and cinematography gives the feature that lifted, slightly angled and unaligned feel. Its world presents itself to you in a disembodied kind of way and, in the way you may leave your bed after a dream, you will leave the cinema questioning everything about it.\n\nI can honestly say The Lobster has entered the ranks of my favourite films. Go and catch this while it's still in cinemas - the critically thirsty mind will not remain unquenched.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2703471385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk5MDU3NTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAwMDI3NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk5MDU3NTExNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAwMDI3NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "International trailer for The Lobster.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-04T09:02:17Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0009008/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jacqueline Abrahams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm0009008?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Donkey Shooter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1875238/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jessica Barden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm1875238?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nosebleed Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7114240/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Anthony Dougall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm7114240?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "70 Year Old Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0268199/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Colin Farrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm0268199?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7114242/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "James Finnegan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm7114242?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bald Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3047502/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rosanna Hoult"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm3047502?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7961173/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ryac"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm7961173?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bob the Dog"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7114244/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kathy Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm7114244?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Police Officer 1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004355/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Roger Ashton-Griffiths"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm0004355?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Doctor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1469236/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Olivia Colman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm1469236?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hotel Manager"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2817543/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sean Duggan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm2817543?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Guard Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7114241/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Roland Ferrandi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm7114241?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Loner Leader's Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7114243/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Robert Heaney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm7114243?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Restaurant Waiter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7961172/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jaro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm7961172?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bob the Dog"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0421332/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ashley Jensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3464902/characters/nm0421332?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Biscuit Woman"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Ireland", "UK", "Greece", "France", "Netherlands", "USA"], "Language": ["English", "French", "Greek"], "Release Date": ["16 October 2015 (Ireland)"], "Also Known As": ["The Lobster"], "Filming Locations": ["County Kerry, Ireland"], "Budget": ["EUR4,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$190,252,", "15 May 2016"], "Gross USA": ["$9,077,245"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$15,509,546"], "Production Co": ["Film4", "Screen Ireland", "Screen Ireland"], "Runtime": ["119 min"], "Sound Mix": ["D-Cinema 48kHz 5.1"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

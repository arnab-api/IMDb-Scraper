At its core, it capably tells a good romantic story, and does a very amusing job at poking fun at people who lord their supposedly superior musical knowledge (and tastes) over others. It's got an attractive and endearing cast, and it naturally also has a non-stop, eclectic soundtrack.\n\nCusack plays Rob, the neurotic owner of a record store that is far from prosperous. His employees are the timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and the far more brash Barry (Jack Black, who walks away with the film). After his longtime girlfriend Laura (charming Danish actress Iben Hjejle) dumps him for another man, it forces him to take stock and reflect on the major relationships - and break-ups - of his life.\n\nCusack is typically engaging, although this viewer could have done without that over-used device of having the main character directly address the camera. The film itself, despite being a little overlong, has some good laughs. I cracked up when Rob fantasized possible reactions to the annoying Ian (an amusing Tim Robbins), including a scenario of him, Barry, and Dick beating the almighty hell out of him.\n\nSome intelligent and pointed dialogue is brought to life by this talented cast, with a steady parade of lovely ladies (Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter) as the women who have caught Robs' eyes over the years. Rob himself is not too sympathetic for much of the running time, but then, that is the whole point as it takes a while to pinpoint himself as a common denominator, and have his eventual epiphany.\n\nNice cameo by rock star Bruce Springsteen, too.\n\nSeven out of 10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000131/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Cusack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0000131?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rob Gordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0521974/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Todd Louiso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0521974?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000956/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lisa Bonet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0000956?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Marie De Salle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000349/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Joan Cusack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0000349?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Liz"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0716854/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chris Rehmann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0716854?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Vince"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000666/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lili Taylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0000666?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sarah Kendrew"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0906031/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Natasha Gregson Wagner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0906031?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Caroline Fortis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0068166/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Drake Bell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0068166?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rob Jr. High"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005013/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Iben Hjejle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0005013?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laura"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0085312/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jack Black"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0085312?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Barry Judd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001876/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Catherine Zeta-Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0001876?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Charlie Nicholson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000209/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tim Robbins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0000209?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ian Raymond"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0139604/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ben Carr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0139604?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Justin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0141710/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joelle Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0141710?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Penny Hardwick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0830315/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Shannon Stillo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0146882/characters/nm0830315?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alison Jr. High"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK", "USA"], "Language": ["English", "Danish"], "Release Date": ["31 March 2000 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["High Fidelity"], "Filming Locations": ["Chicago, Illinois, USA"], "Budget": ["$30,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$6,429,107,", "2 April 2000"], "Gross USA": ["$27,287,137"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$47,126,295"], "Production Co": ["Touchstone Pictures", "Working Title Films", "Dogstar Films"], "Runtime": ["113 min"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

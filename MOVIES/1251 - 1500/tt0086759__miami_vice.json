It quite obvious the best season of Miami Vice is the first season. Season one was the season where Vice really focused all it's episodes in real life situations. Situations which really happen in real life. Vice started with a bang with the excellent pilot episode, and it never looked backed for the next 22 episodes. Season one was everything that made Mimai Vice what it is now. Action, drama, intensity, thrills , music, style, and relationships. One episode that features all this, is Calderone's Return- Part 1 and 2. Two really fantastic episodes. Other great episodes of season 1 are The Great McCarthy, Little Prince, Milk Run, I can go on and on. One truly classic season. \n\nAs good as Season 2 was and it was good, it doesn't compare to Season 1. The problem with season 2, is the show focusing on bizarre situations such as voodoo, satanism, and other weird stuff. Season 2 featured three episodes that I consider awful. Whatever Works, Tale of the Goat, and Bushido. Three episodes that season 1 would of never of thought of making. Even though I don't like these episodes, I still consider season 2 a very good season. It just doesn't even come close to the flawless season 1. I do think though that season 2 features the greatest Miami Vice episode of all time which is The Prodigal Son. A well directed, very entertaining Vice episode that features lots of action, drug busts, romance, and totally awesome 80's music. Your not a real Vice fan if you don't like The Prodigal Son.\n\nIt's sad to say, out of all five seasons of Vice, only the first two seasons defy what Miami Vice was and are the only two seasons that really kick Miami Vice ass!! Season 3 became more of a darker Vice that took away everything that made the first two seasons such a highly entertaining show. Gone was the pastel background colors, snappy pop tunes, and Crocketts famous look that made him an icon among men and his fast wheeling car. Dark broody colors were replaced in the background, the music was replaced with unknown artists, and Crockett looked more like a banker/rock star, and his beloved Spider Ferrari was replaced with a Testarossa. Which was blown up in the season premiere of season 3 When Irish Eyes are Crying.\n\nSeason 3 took out all the fun and excitement of the first two seasons and replaced it with a more darker depressing Miami Vice. The outcome, ratings dropped, and the show was not Miami Vice that everyone fell in love with. I think the problem lies with the shows producer John Nicolla, who left and was replaced by Dick Wolf who probably was never in favor of the pastel energetic Mimai Vice of the first two seasons. So if anyone is to blame of Vice's downfall, it's Dick Wolf. Creator also of the lame Law and Order series. \n\nI have nothing to say about seasons 4 or 5 except that was this really Miami Vice the show that was unlike any other in the history of television. I have nothing good to say about seasons 4 or 5, except horrifically awful, especially season 4. Can't get any worse than that.\n\nThere is great news though as of this writing Miami Vice is finally being released on DVD. Season 1 that is. The complete season of all 22 episodes and it's original music intact. Wow what a collection that will be, I can't wait. Presume to come out later this year, around Christmas time. What a Christams present that will make! Miami VICE LIVES ON!!! THE GREATEST DAMN SHOW EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION!!!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Miami Vice: Season Two", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2845376793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E1OWVlZGMtN2ZiZC00MmQzLWExMTctYmI1Yjk3MWE2MWQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2E1OWVlZGMtN2ZiZC00MmQzLWExMTctYmI1Yjk3MWE2MWQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:15:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000467/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Don Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086759/characters/nm0000467?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Detective James Crockett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1984-1989"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0763639/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Saundra Santiago"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086759/characters/nm0763639?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Detective Gina Calabrese"}, {"url": "#", "name": "111 episodes, 1984-1989"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0847999/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael Talbott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086759/characters/nm0847999?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Detective Stan Switek"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 1984-1989"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0225963/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "John Diehl"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0086759/characters/nm0225963?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Det.

I am just now getting to explore the actors whose careers have been postponed, in our lives, by Ninja Turtles and Disney. I fell in lust with Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean and he made me a real fan in Finding Neverland. But in Gilbert Grape, he won my heart completely. This man can act with his eyes. The biggest surprise was Leo DiCaprio as Arnie. Amazing, and he was only 19 when the film was released. He gave an amazing portrayal of a boy who goes in and out of his own world. Juliette Lewis was a quiet storm in this film; she gave Gilbert an anchor of solid acceptance when the pain of his life almost got the best of him. \n\nThe casting worked perfectly to create family dynamics that were so very real that they did not even seem brandable as dysfunctional. I appreciated that the mother was never portrayed as less intelligent simply because she was overweight. I loved that the kids did everything they could to protect their mother and their disturbed brother from outside influences and hurt feelings. They stuck together until the end which actually became the beginning. A hopeful and joyous film.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4011572761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwZTIyMzgtZmQ0Ny00ZTAzLThhOGYtY2Y5ODJiYjMzYWMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwZTIyMzgtZmQ0Ny00ZTAzLThhOGYtY2Y5ODJiYjMzYWMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-01T10:11:55Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000136/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Depp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108550/characters/nm0000136?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gilbert Grape"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000496/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Juliette Lewis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108550/characters/nm0000496?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Becky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0146055/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Darlene Cates"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108550/characters/nm0146055?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Momma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0770788/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Kate Schellhardt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108550/characters/nm0770788?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ellen Grape"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000604/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "John C.

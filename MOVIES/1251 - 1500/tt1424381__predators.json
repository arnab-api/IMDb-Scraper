I almost gave this film a miss, but I'm glad I didn't. It was actually quite good, and I'll tell you why (no spoilers I promise). \n\nI think it is important to go into this film with the right expectations. This film returns to the original Predator format, and borrows heavily from the first 1987 Predator film. There are scenes and characters (and even weapons) which are so reminiscent of the first film that they would not be out of place in a remake. I like to view this as very deliberate homage to the original rather than shameless plagiarism, and I enjoyed the film more and feel much happier because of it. Of course this is not a remake. It is a sequel with some major differences from the 1987 film, and enough originality to make it interesting and unique in its own right.\n\nThe story is not overly ambitious, they play it straight and the focus is given more to building tension, which it manages to do very well. Because it is a Predator film you kind of know what is going to happen, but it still manages to be suspenseful from the start, and there are quite a few surprises and twists along the way to keep you guessing. The unnerving way the truth of their situation unfolds for the characters is quite enthralling, and reminded me strongly of shows like 'The Outer Limits'.\n\nThe characters are interesting and all of them are well portrayed. Some are a little clich\u00e9, but the main character played by Adrien Brody is actually more human and teeters on the edge of being a full blown anti- hero. \n\nMy only major gripe with this film is that there is little character development. The characters are (as I said) interesting, but there just doesn't seem to be enough time to explore them very deeply. The most you really get is a shallow glimpse of who they might be, which left question marks over some of their motivations. This does make the film slightly forgettable, as you never really end up feeling or caring too much for them, and sometime it feels like they do things just to drive the plot/action forward, rather than because it is something their character might do.\n\nOverall I would give the film a 7 out of 10, it was above average for and action flick and screamed quality, despite a retentively low budget, and I definitely wouldn't mind going to see it again. An entertaining action thriller at worst, and a nice edition to the Predator franchise.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Predators: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2220360729", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5OTUyNDY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc1MzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5OTUyNDY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc1MzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A group of elite warriors are hunted by members of a merciless alien race known as Predators.", "uploadDate": "2010-03-23T15:16:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004778/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Adrien Brody"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0004778?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Royce"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0103797/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alice Braga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0103797?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Isabelle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0847727/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Oleg Taktarov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0847727?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nikolai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001803/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Danny Trejo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0001803?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cuchillo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0991810/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mahershala Ali"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0991810?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mombasa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0824498/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Brian Steele"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0824498?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Berserker Predator"}, {"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0824498?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Falconer Predator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0333410/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Topher Grace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0333410?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Edwin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0324658/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Walton Goggins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0324658?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Stans"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000401/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Laurence Fishburne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0000401?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ronald Noland"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1559194/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Louis Ozawa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm1559194?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Hanzo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0427681/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Carey Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0427681?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Tracker Predator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0575216/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Derek Mears"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1424381/characters/nm0575216?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Classic Predator"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish", "Russian"], "Release Date": ["9 July 2010 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Predator 3"], "Filming Locations": ["Hamilton Pool, Dripping Springs, Texas, USA"], "Budget": ["$40,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$24,760,882,", "11 July 2010"], "Gross USA": ["$52,000,688"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$127,233,108"], "Production Co": ["Twentieth Century Fox", "Troublemaker Studios", "Davis Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["107 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "DTS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

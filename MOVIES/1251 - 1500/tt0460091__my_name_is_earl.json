We were really looking forward to this show and it totally delivered. You know a show is good if the funniest jokes aren't wasted in the trailer. Funny, well-written with great timing and direction. I instantly set my DVR to record all episodes to make sure I don't miss a single one. I thought the premise was very unique and while Earl appears to be a stereotype, there are unplumbed depths. The peripheral characters are a hoot, the choice of music also elicited quite a few laughs.\n\nI am hoping the rest of the season holds up to the extremely well-done pilot. I think this really could be a classic, besides we have the promise of 258 possible episodes!\n\n12/27 Footnote: The show has exceeded all my expectations and I am happy to see Earl adding to his list - so we could have inifinite episodes - yippeee."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "My Name Is Earl: Season Two", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4103799065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY1YTNhOWMtY2NlNy00MmFiLTgzNDQtYjhkZmM5ZGE1ZDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmY1YTNhOWMtY2NlNy00MmFiLTgzNDQtYjhkZmM5ZGE1ZDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:22:54Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005134/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jason Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0460091/characters/nm0005134?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Earl Hickey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "96 episodes, 2005-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005326/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jaime Pressly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0460091/characters/nm0005326?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joy Turner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "96 episodes, 2005-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1100337/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eddie Steeples"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0460091/characters/nm1100337?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Darnell Turner"}, {"url": "#", "name": "96 episodes, 2005-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0839486/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ethan Suplee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0460091/characters/nm0839486?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Randy Hickey"}, {"url": "#", "name": "96 episodes, 2005-2009"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1229204/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nadine Velazquez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0460091/characters/nm1229204?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Catalina"}, {"url": "#", "name": "96 episodes, 2005-2009"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["20 September 2005 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["My Name Is Earl"], "Filming Locations": ["Beaumont, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["20th Century Fox Television", "Amigos de Garcia Productions"], "Runtime": ["22 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo", "Dolby"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

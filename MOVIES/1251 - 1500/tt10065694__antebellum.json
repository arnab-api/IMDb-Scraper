It also chronicles events in the life of a successful modern-day author called Veronica. As the film progresses, the connection between these two storylines becomes clear, and that's about all I can say about the plot.\n\nTHE POSITIVES\n\nOne of the biggest strengths of the flick, is a masterful hand behind the camera. Gorgeous cinematography, guided by thoughtful direction, bring as much emotional impact to the film as the stellar performances do. The structural editing on display here, is a showcase of the profound understanding the filmmakers have of the narrative. The film is filled to the brim with subtle visual setups that have satisfying pay-offs at the end. The opening scene is one of the most gripping collection of images, I've seen all year. It was an absolute treat to discover that the final sequence reaches the same impactfull heights but with a very different connotation. I can't stress enough how the technical aspects of Antebellum are Oscarworthy. cinematography, lighting, production design and costume design are in a league of their own. They all work together to truly make the performances shine.\n\n THE NEGATIVES\n\nUnfortunately, the film undoes a lot of the greatness within itself, as the flick goes along. The underlying message is anything but underlying. It rather weighs down heavily on the audience and is often times spelled out to the letter. All of the striking, brutal imagery, is somehow negated by heavy-handed pandering to an agenda, I don't even disagree with. An almost comedic over the top female villain who is in sharp contrast with some bold, grounded performances by other antagonists, offers nothing more than frustration. I truly want to love this film more than it allows me to.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nAntebellum is composed out of a collection of striking images that showcase craftsmanship in front and behind the camera. Its brutal, grounded and thoughtful imagery is undermined however, by a painfully, spelled out message that comes across as pandering more often than not.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4212375065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE2ODAxZTQtMGM1NC00NzVkLWEzYTYtOGE0ZGYxNTAyZWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE2ODAxZTQtMGM1NC00NzVkLWEzYTYtOGE0ZGYxNTAyZWEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Successful author Veronica Henley finds herself trapped in a horrifying reality and must uncover the mind-bending mystery before its too late.\n\nStarring Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Marque Richardson II, Eric Lange, Jack Huston, Kiersey Clemons, Tongayi Chirisa, Gabourey Sidibe, Rob Aramayo, Lily Cowles, and Jena Malone, the film is released August 21 in the US and the UK.", "uploadDate": "2020-06-25T14:48:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4959292/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Arabella Landrum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10065694/characters/nm4959292?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Little Blonde Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1441925/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eric Lange"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10065694/characters/nm1441925?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Him"}, {"url": "/title/tt10065694/characters/nm1441925?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Senator Denton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2475161/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tongayi Chirisa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10065694/characters/nm2475161?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eli"}, {"url": "/title/tt10065694/characters/nm2475161?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Professor Tarasai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1658935/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jack Huston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt10065694/characters/nm1658935?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Captain Jasper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3958642/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "T.C.

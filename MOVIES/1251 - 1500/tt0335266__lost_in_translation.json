Sofia Coppola's second film as a director is in part about things we never talk about. While its two protagonists try to find mutual solace in each other, their silence is as expressive as their words. This is a film that believes that an individual can have a valuable relationship with someone else without becoming part of that person's life. At 19 years of age, I am not married but I can understand pretty well that it is easier for a stranger with whom you share a moment in the bar or corridor to understand your problems better than your husband or wife. Here is an extract from Roger Ebert's great review of the film: \"We all need to talk about metaphysics, but those who know us well want details and specifics; strangers allow us to operate more vaguely on a cosmic scale. When the talk occurs between two people who could plausibly have sex together, it gathers a special charge: you can only say \"I feel like I've known you for years\" to someone you have not known for years.\" \n\nIn this marvellous story, the two lonely individuals that merge the illusions of what they have and what they could have are two Americans. The emotional refuge, Tokyo. We have Bob Harris (Bill Murray), and actor in his fifties who was once a star, and is now supplementing his incomes with the recording of a whisky commercial. On the other side of the telephone, a frightening reality: his wife, his sons, and the mission of choosing the right material for heaven knows what part of the house. When we consider Bob's situation, we realise that Lost in Translation is also a meditation on the misery of fame. Certainly fame has great (perhaps greater than disadvantages) advantages but then there are the obligations, the expectations...\n\nWe also have Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a woman in her twenties who is accompanying her husband, a photographer addicted to work, on a business trip. But it could said it is as if she is alone anyway. Her world, just like Bob's, is reduced to strange days in the bedroom, the corridors, the hotel's swimming pool, and the bar, the perfect destination for victims of sleeplessness and wounded soul. The bar is the place Bob and Charlotte meet for the first time. They talk, little, but just enough. Once their dislike for parts of their lives are established, they begin sharing times that feel dead to be able to feel alive.\n\nBob and Charlotte are souls in transition for whom, surrounded and confused by exotic rituals, and a different language, allows them a moment to lose their identities. Both characters provoke similar feelings form different experiences. There are no kisses or crazy nights between them, but only a shared intimacy in which a night out, a walk in the streets, a session of karaoke becomes a powerful expression of their affection an complicity. The relationship we all await only happens in our minds and the protagonists, whom we are not allowed to know everything they say and desire. Tokyo metaphorically speaking is the third character in the film. The bright colours, the noise of the city...just everything evokes the various spiritual awakenings of the characters. \n\nIt ends on a perfect note leaving the relationship of the characters undecided. A rare gem in modern day cinema.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lost in Translation", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2994779673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NDcwNDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI0NjkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NDcwNDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI0NjkxMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Lost in Translation", "uploadDate": "2016-10-01T06:01:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0424060/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Scarlett Johansson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm0424060?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Charlotte"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440108/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Akiko Takeshita"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440108?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ms. Kawasaki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440085/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kazuko Shibata"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440085?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Press Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440060/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ryuichiro Baba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440060?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Concierge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440105/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Catherine Lambert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440105?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jazz Singer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440072/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tim Leffman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440072?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sausalito Guitar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0020955/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Richard Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm0020955?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "American Businessman #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0846329/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Diamond Yukai"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm0846329?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Commercial Director"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000195/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bill Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm0000195?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bob Harris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440076/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kazuyoshi Minamimagoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440076?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Press Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440090/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Take"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440090?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Press Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440095/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Akira Yamaguchi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440095?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bellboy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1440096/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois du Bois"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1440096?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Sausalito Piano"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1404231/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Gregory Pekar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm1404231?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "American Businessman #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000610/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Giovanni Ribisi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0335266/characters/nm0000610?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "Japan"], "Language": ["English", "Japanese", "German", "French"], "Release Date": ["3 October 2003 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Lost in Translation"], "Filming Locations": ["Omote-Sando, Tokyo, Japan"], "Budget": ["$4,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$925,087,", "14 September 2003"], "Gross USA": ["$44,585,453"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$118,686,937"], "Production Co": ["Focus Features", "Tohokushinsha Film Corporation (TFC)", "American Zoetrope"], "Runtime": ["102 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

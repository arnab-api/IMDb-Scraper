When I saw the trailer, I was madly excited. It looked fantastic. But then, after a while, I remembered, that the main point of a trailer is to do just that. Hype the film, while revealing literally all the main plot scenes and parts. I didn't know if it was the case with 'Safe House', since, hey, it's Denzel Washington. That man doesn't just do any role.\n\nI just got back from the movie theater, and am I glad that I was wrong. The movie is fantastic, electrifying. Do know that I don't just 'get off' on any action flick. In most cases, I just watch and forget. This was actually, fantastic. I don't have a single bad word to say about it, the way it was directed, acted or anything else. Everything was simply fantastic.\n\nI realize my words sound absurd, and the score looks the same, but it really is worth it. I didn't see an action movie this well written, and this well acted in a really, really long time. Of course, by the end of the movie, any experienced watcher will figure out the ending by himself, but even though you 'get it', it's still extremely fun to sit through and see how the pieces connect.\n\nI really hate long reviews, so I'm trying to make this one as short and sweet as possible. Lastly, have in mind that not one cast member failed his role. Ryan was fantastic, even better then I could've imagined (a nice showing of his acting skills after Green Lantern and Change-Up), and Denzel, what to say that hasn't been already said about that man's acting. Phenomenal doesn't cut it.\n\nGo and see it. It's much better then anything else thats currently 'showing'.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3006438937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTU5NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY3MTEwNw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTU5NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY3MTEwNw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When a CIA-operated safe house is targeted by a group of bad guys, the facility's house-sitter is tasked with the dangerous job of moving the criminal who is being hidden there to another secure location.", "uploadDate": "2011-11-05T13:16:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000243/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Denzel Washington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0000243?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tobin Frost"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267812/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vera Farmiga"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0267812?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Catherine Linklater"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001731/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sam Shepard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0001731?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Harlan Whitford"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2482391/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nora Arnezeder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm2482391?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ana Moreau"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0192377/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Liam Cunningham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0192377?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Alec Wade"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0267241/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Fares Fares"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0267241?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Vargas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2728757/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Stephen Rider"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm2728757?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "CIA Analyst"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1139632/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tracie Thoms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm1139632?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "CIA Analyst"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005351/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ryan Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Matt Weston"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0322407/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brendan Gleeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0322407?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "David Barlow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001952/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rub\u00e9n Blades"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0001952?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Carlos Villar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001598/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Robert Patrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0001598?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Daniel Kiefer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1172478/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joel Kinnaman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm1172478?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Keller"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235550/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jenna Dover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm0235550?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "CIA Analyst"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2674546/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Daniel Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1599348/characters/nm2674546?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "CIA Analyst"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["South Africa", "USA", "Japan"], "Language": ["English", "Afrikaans"], "Release Date": ["10 February 2012 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Safe House"], "Filming Locations": ["Cape Town Film Studios, Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa"], "Budget": ["$85,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$40,172,720,", "12 February 2012"], "Gross USA": ["$126,373,434"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$208,076,205"], "Production Co": ["Universal Pictures", "Relativity Media", "Bluegrass Films"], "Runtime": ["115 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Datasat", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

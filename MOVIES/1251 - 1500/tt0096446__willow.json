The effects look a little dated now (especially the two-headed beastie) but it has enough humour and action to keep most satisfied. It's no LOTR, but then it was made 14 years ago.\n\nWarwick Davis plays Willow, a Nelwynn, a race of hobbit-sized folk who don't have anything to do with \"The Big People\" as they call humans. Basically, it's the Shire transplanted into this movie, but without the budget. Billy Barty is the village's wizard and basically plays the character Gweldor again (from Masters of the Universe) but without the silly make-up and stupid musical key.\n\nVal Kilmer is Madmartigan, a human warrior who befriends Willow and helps him on his journey with varying degrees of ulterior motive.\n\nThe acting is all reasonably good. Warwick Davis was only 18 when this film was released so his performance is very good considering his age and lack of experience (prior to this he'd played a goblin in Labyrinth and an ewok in Return of the Jedi). It's also interesting to see Pat Roach here. Pat was a former wrestler and has carved out a little niche for himself playing villains and tough guys. Here he plays General Kael, the right-hand henchman of Queen Bavmorda, played with gusto by Jean Marsh. That woman is truly frightening.\n\nIt's all good fun and the two funniest characters in the movie are Franjean and Rool, two Brownies, who \"help\" Willow regardless of the latters wishes. They have the funniest double act and reminded me more than a little of Merry and Pippin in LOTR.\n\nAll in all well worth a watch if you want some pure, and somewhat silly, entertainment.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Willow: Blu-Ray", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1038067481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3YjBjZDYtMWY0ZC00MjcwLWJhODMtNWE3MWI1ZDAwYmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3YjBjZDYtMWY0ZC00MjcwLWJhODMtNWE3MWI1ZDAwYmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Willow", "uploadDate": "2013-01-06T06:39:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000174/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Val Kilmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096446/characters/nm0000174?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Madmartigan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001116/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Warwick Davis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096446/characters/nm0001116?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Willow Ufgood"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0371175/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patricia Hayes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096446/characters/nm0371175?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Fin Raziel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0730053/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pat Roach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0096446/characters/nm0730053?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gen.

That is all I can say about E.T. IT's gripping, intelligent story mixed with its incredible symbolism makes it one of the best films ever made. E.T. is a story about friendship, loyalty, and family. But most of all it is about love, and how powerful love is. The brilliantly innovative shots mixed with John William's epic score makes for a masterpiece, which E.T. certainly is. The underlying theme of science vs. religion is also what makes the film great. All of these things mesh together to form the film that \"touched millions of people around the world.\" Everything about this film is great. Steven Spielberg pulls off some legendary shots, and the acting from the children is excellent. It makes the film truly real. Henry Thomas as Elliot is great. Drew Barrymoore is so cute throughout he whole film and she captures the audience every time she appears on screen. Peter Coyote does great with the minimal screen time they chose to give him. The relationship between E.T. and Elliot can be marked as one of the greatest friendships in Hollywood history, and if you have not seen this film I urge you to rent it or see it somehow as soon as possible. If you want to see why everyone raves about Spielberg being the greatest director of all time see this film. It truly shows him at his best. It will not only make you laugh and make you smile, but it will touch your heart deeper than any movie has touched you before. E.T. will go down as one of the greatest films as all time. Its timelessness is one of a kind. Forget what you hear about it being overrated. See it for yourself and understand why this film is apart of a small collection of films that will stay in our hearts forever and ever.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial: Anniversay Edition [Blu-Ray + Digital Copy]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3090130201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3Yzk1ODAtMzcyYS00Mjg3LWE2NjQtNzY3M2IwOTNjYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3Yzk1ODAtMzcyYS00Mjg3LWE2NjQtNzY3M2IwOTNjYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 2 for E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial", "uploadDate": "2012-08-31T03:14:05Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0908914/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dee Wallace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0908914?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mary"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001075/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter Coyote"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0001075?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Keys"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000106/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Drew Barrymore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0000106?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gertie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0296892/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sean Frye"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0296892?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Steve"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000143/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Erika Eleniak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0000143?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Pretty Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0842721/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Richard Swingler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0842721?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Science Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0059240/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Robert Barton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0059240?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ultra Sound Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0075500/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "David Berkson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0075500?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Medical Unit"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001794/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Henry Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0001794?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Elliott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0534085/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robert MacNaughton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083866/characters/nm0534085?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0551502/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "K.C.

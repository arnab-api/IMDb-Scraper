Rusty Griswold is all grown up with kids of his own and decides to take them to Walley World like his dad did with their family all those years ago. The results are just as chaotic, if never quite as funny. Remakes, reboots, etc. are always tough to make work (as they should be) but this one does surprisingly OK. It's not a patch on the first few Vacation films with Chevy Chase (who has an unfunny appearance late in this movie) but it is good in its own way. Ed Helms and Christina Applegate provide few of the laughs, which hurts more than anything since they are the leads. Most of the successful humor comes from the guest stars like Chris Hemsworth and the two kids playing the sons, Steele Stebbins and Skyler Gisondo. Stebbins is especially funny and easily the best part of the movie. To the movie's credit, it doesn't simply do a scene-for-scene remake and tries to make its own mark. But years of road trip comedies, many of which were inspired by the original Vacation, makes this feel more than a little familiar. Still, it's watchable and provides some laughs if you're in the right mood.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi305639449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI0NTQ2NzQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU5NDk4NTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI0NTQ2NzQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU5NDk4NTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Following in his father's footsteps and hoping for some much-needed family bonding, a grown-up Rusty Griswold surprises his wife, Debbie, and their two sons with a cross-country trip back to America's \"favorite family fun park,\" Walley World.", "uploadDate": "2015-06-04T18:22:34Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1159180/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ed Helms"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm1159180?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rusty Griswold"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1711114/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Skyler Gisondo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm1711114?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Griswold"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1165110/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chris Hemsworth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm1165110?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Stone Crandall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000331/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chevy Chase"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm0000331?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Clark Griswold"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206359/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Charlie Day"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm0206359?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0515296/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ron Livingston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm0515296?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ethan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1221047/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Keegan-Michael Key"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm1221047?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jack Peterson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6957616/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Emyri Crutchfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm6957616?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sheila Peterson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000775/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Christina Applegate"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm0000775?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Debbie Griswold"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4347315/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Steele Stebbins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm4347315?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kevin Griswold"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005182/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Leslie Mann"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm0005182?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Audrey Crandall"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000350/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Beverly D'Angelo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm0000350?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ellen Griswold"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4247844/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Catherine Missal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm4247844?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Adena"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005342/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Norman Reedus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm0005342?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Trucker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0356021/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Regina Hall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1524930/characters/nm0356021?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nancy Peterson"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["29 July 2015 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Vacation"], "Filming Locations": ["Atlanta, Georgia, USA"], "Budget": ["$31,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$14,681,108,", "2 August 2015"], "Gross USA": ["$58,884,188"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$107,228,221"], "Production Co": ["BenderSpink", "David Dobkin Productions", "New Line Cinema"], "Runtime": ["99 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

We've been to Naples, from Formia going through the region where they make the mozzarella di bufala, and that's exactly the feeling we had. The exceptional link to the land, the narrow streets of Naples, which felt like Rome's punk sister - an exceptional city on its own, being in the shadow of the Vesuvius ... and the food! Great, great work, and excellent host. Good to showcase the locals - and keeping it in the original Italian... get use to subtitles, that what makes it so authentic! Looking forward to the remaining episodes, hope Lazio will be in there.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2828582937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk5M2YyOTktNGE3Ny00NTRjLTg0YTEtOWMyNTcwMDQ5MGVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk5M2YyOTktNGE3Ny00NTRjLTg0YTEtOWMyNTcwMDQ5MGVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-03-22T18:43:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001804/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Stanley Tucci"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt11852724/characters/nm0001804?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "6 episodes, 2021"}]}], "details": {"Release Date": ["14 February 2021 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy"], "Production Co": ["Raw Television"], "Runtime": ["60 min"]}}

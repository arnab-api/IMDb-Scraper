reasons that I began writing movie reviews is to bring attention to good, entertaining flicks that might be flying under your radar. \u00a0Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's latest heist flick LOGAN LUCKY. \u00a0This is an entertaining movie that moves quickly and has much more under the surface than you might first think.\n\nStrongly and ably directed by Soderbergh, LOGAN LUCKY tells the story of the \"cursed\" Logan family of West Virginia (Channing Tatum, Adam Driver and Riley Keough) who are facing tough times. \u00a0The solution to their problem? \u00a0Rob the vault at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. \u00a0They enlist the Bang brothers (Jack Quaid, Brian Gleeson and a surprisingly, effectively funny Daniel Craig). \u00a0One problem there, Craig's character is currently in jail.\n\nCan this group of seemingly dimwitted West Virginians pull off the caper? \u00a0That's the fun of this movie and it's territory that Soderbergh has covered before with the OCEAN'S 11 films (there is even a callback in this flick\u00a0to those movies\u00a0when someone calls the robbery OCEAN'S 7/11) and he covers this territory well. \u00a0The caper is clever, yet simple. \u00a0Soderbergh (or, rather, writer Rebecca Blunt - which is believed\u00a0to be a pseudonym for someone else) does a clever job of having Tatum's character keep a list of 10 things to think about during a robbery and the script follows these rules, which makes things easy to follow.\n\nBut, of course, in these types of films, it is the characters that make (or break) things and Soderbergh has assembled a a crew that is\u00a0very enjoyable to watch starting with Channing Tatum \u00a0(MAGIC MIKE)\u00a0as Jimmy Logan, a former high school and college football \"legend\" (at least in West Virginia) who is having trouble making ends meet as a result of a career ending knee injury. \u00a0Tatum does a nice job of showing us a thoughtful, rounded human being under the veneer of a West Virginia \"hick\". \u00a0He is joined by his one-armed brother, Adam Driver, (Kylo Ren in STAR WARS) \u00a0in another interesting and watchable performance and their sister, Mellie (Riley Keough, MAD MAX: FURY ROAD) a performer who I knew little about before this film, but is one that I will be keeping an eye on going forward.\n\nThe film picks up energy with the introduction of the Bang brothers. \u00a0Dim-witted (and I do mean dim-witted) Fish and Sam Bang (an unrecognizable Jack Quaid and Brian Gleeson, son of Brendan) - who gave me 2 or 3 strong, burst out-loud laughs\u00a0and their older brother, explosives expert Joe Bang. \u00a0This was the best, most surprising part -\u00a0Joe Bang is played with a continual twinkle in his eye by James Bond himself, Daniel Craig. \u00a0You can see the danger in his eyes and movements but you can also detect a layer of intelligence in his portrayal, all the while keeping the \"wink\" in his eye that let's you know that he (and we) are having fun. \u00a0Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Dwight Yoakim's turn as the head of the prison where Joe Bang is incarcerated. \u00a0I want to see a film of Yoakim running this prison. \u00a0There is so much story there to mine.\n\nThe film isn't perfect - there is a subplot involving a NASCAR driver (Sebastian Stan - Bucky in the AVENGERS films) and his owner (a miscast Seth McFarlane) that goes nowhere and Katherine Waterston is wasted in the \"love interest for Tatum\" role, but all-in-all, I had a good time at this film and I think you will, too.\n\nIt's the perfect film for a rainy Saturday afternoon, which is what most of Minnesota (and Texas!) will be having today.\n\nLetter Grade B+\n\n8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)hat to the Bank (ofMarquis)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "UK

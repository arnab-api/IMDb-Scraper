That is not what I believe what I got. Yet it was still a very good movie.\n\nThe acting performances were also good but not great. Denzel Washington gave a very good performance but not Oscar worthy, it felt like I have seen this before from him. Russell Crowe just was not given the room to actually act. I wish Crowe would have been given more of an opportunity to show off his talent. Josh Brolin gave the best performance as a corrupt police officer. He displayed perfectly the corrupt cop blackmailing both sides for the benefit of himself. I do not really understand the Oscar nomination for Ruby Dee playing Frank Lucas mother. She barley even had a cameo in this movie. It is kind of sad to see how far Cuba Gooding Jr. has fallen not having much of a role in this movie. \n\nWhat really kept this movie up and kind of brought it down was its steady flow and writing. It did show you some interesting things such as going to Vietnam and having a very unique and surprising place to smuggle in the drugs. Yet as I mentioned before the performances were good but not great because of the writing. I attribute this to the writing. Some of the writing did not allow some of the actors to expand as much as they could have on their roles.\n\nAlso the directing was very good but not great. Ridley Scott did show some interesting scenes and had good camera shot. The cinematography was good as well. Yet because the performances were not to great that brings him down because his job to guide arguably two of the best actors today.\n\nThis movie was a bit over-hyped but I would still recommend it. This probably could have received more recognition from the Oscars though.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "American Gangster", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3216048409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTg2NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTg2NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "American Gangster Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-08-30T08:16:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000243/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Denzel Washington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0000243?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Frank Lucas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0252230/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chiwetel Ejiofor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0252230?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Huey Lucas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1317082/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lymari Nadal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm1317082?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Eva"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809793/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Roger Guenveur Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0809793?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0753526/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "RZA"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0753526?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Moses Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0329511/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Malcolm Goodwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0329511?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jimmy Zee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0763650/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ruben Santiago-Hudson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0763650?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Doc"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2294223/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Skyler Fortgang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm2294223?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Roberts"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000128/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Russell Crowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0000128?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Richie Roberts"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000982/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Josh Brolin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0000982?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Detective Trupo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0505971/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ted Levine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0505971?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lou Toback"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0370035/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "John Hawkes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0370035?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Freddie Spearman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0891485/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Yul Vazquez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0891485?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alfonse Abruzzo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002039/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ruby Dee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0002039?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Mama Lucas"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001303/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Carla Gugino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0765429/characters/nm0001303?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Laurie Roberts"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA", "UK"], "Language": ["English", "Thai", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["2 November 2007 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Tru Blu"], "Filming Locations": ["Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA"], "Budget": ["$100,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$43,565,135,", "4 November 2007"], "Gross USA": ["$130,164,645"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$269,755,430"], "Production Co": ["Universal Pictures", "Imagine Entertainment", "Relativity Media"], "Runtime": ["157 min", "176 min", "(extended)"], "Sound Mix": ["SDDS", "DTS", "Dolby Digital", "Dolby Atmos", "DTS", "(DTS: X)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

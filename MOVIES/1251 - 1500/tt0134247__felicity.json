The main character was a beautiful girl who have too choice in the boy of her dreams and her soul mate. The first year was great because explain . all the university student problem, and young adult troubles (like lost the virginity, violation, obsession, relationship, ambition and frustration). the following start excellent, reinventing the show (like the \"Twilightzone\") and with more actually controversial topics  (not Russell hair cut)like the gratuity use of pill, it was also much more about Felicity than his friend  and  life in collage but end bad with a too nice  reunion of Felicity and Ben. The third one was the shorter, it was good but not long enough in that season Felicity seems very tired. However the other characters were more interesting (Elena Virgin boyfriend, the relationship of Maghan and Sean, The English girl and his violent boyfriend, the depression and goodbye of Julie, Noel's failure marriage). The last season started excellent with the leading affair with his friend. Most of the audience I think they wan to see Noel with Felicity, but the producer decide to finish with Ben.  The only good topic   of the first part was Noel depression. After Ben unfaithful, she back to the past to rescue her first love Noel. That was a funny idea but end horrible. She return to the present with Ben. Not only who choice one guy, also Elena who died in a car accident was alive with his fianc\u00e9e (totally incoherent). The first season end good because the audience didn't know her choice. In the end she not only return to Ben, also she decided to stay the rest of her life with him. Most of the people wants to see in the end to see Felicity with Noel. I think that the propionate ending was a much more open mind final, where she end alone or with a third guy, because it's difficult to marry and have a nice life with your university boy/girlfriend. Maybe a good idea was when she choose Ben, then Noel left her fianc\u00e9e in the church and all the story begins again. Not only end worse the whole chapter was a mess, there is not a dramatically scene between Elena (that supposed to be dead in the future) with Felicity, and the Sean Maeganhan relation end in chaos. In others time creative screenwriting's, destroy complete the end of the series with this horrible ending. That's a pity\n\n\n\nI hope that there is an alternative"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Felicity: Season 4", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2245919001", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc3YzAzYmYtYTE1My00MjIwLWFlMWQtMTI3OTYyYjQ3MTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc3YzAzYmYtYTE1My00MjIwLWFlMWQtMTI3OTYyYjQ3MTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT #1 Post", "uploadDate": "2008-08-04T03:18:57Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005392/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Keri Russell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0005392?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Felicity Porter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004930/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Scott Foley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0004930?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Noel Crane"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342399/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Greg Grunberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0342399?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sean Blumberg"}, {"url": "#", "name": "68 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005057/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Amy Jo Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0005057?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Julie Emrick"}, {"url": "#", "name": "50 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0070810/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rob Benedict"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0070810?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Richard Coad"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005454/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Scott Speedman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0005454?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ben Covington"}, {"url": "#", "name": "84 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005233/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tangi Miller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0005233?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elena Tyler"}, {"url": "#", "name": "75 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0286022/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Amanda Foreman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0286022?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Meghan Rotundi"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0327020/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ian Gomez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0134247/characters/nm0327020?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Javier Clemente Quintata"}, {"url": "#", "name": "46 episodes, 1998-2002"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["29 September 1998 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Felicity"], "Production Co": ["Touchstone Television", "Imagine Television"], "Runtime": ["60 min", "60 min", "(84 episodes)"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.33 : 1"]}}

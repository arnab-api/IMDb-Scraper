How can people seriously rate and review this series with only watching the beginning?", "reviewBody": "This show is gripping and engaging throughout the whole season. There are of course small details that don't make much sense like the police chief using the wimpiest police cruiser. He's supposed to be the boss but the male police officer is always going against him and he never puts him in his place officially, other than punching him or name calling. It's the end of the series that really gets me annoyed and drops the rating 2 stars. Just to make sure there are no spoilers I won't go into detail. A person who should be loyal to another person, 100%, decides to betray in a few ways at the end. In this reality, the ending would never be as the story shows!!! Horribly written ending!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 - Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3597253145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmNmRhZTAtNGEyMi00NTEyLWExYWMtYTEyY2IwM2U3ZmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmFmNmRhZTAtNGEyMi00NTEyLWExYWMtYTEyY2IwM2U3ZmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "Tim Roth is back in Season 2 of the epic thriller, Tin Star.

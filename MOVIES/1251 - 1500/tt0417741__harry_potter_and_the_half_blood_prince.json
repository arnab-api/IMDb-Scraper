Most of the time they manage it without compromising the integrity of the film. This time they fall very short of the mark. For those that have not read the book this movie will impress. The effects are top notch and it is a very engrossing film. I understand the need to cut the movie in order to fit it into a realistic time frame. In doing so, it seems as if they cut key parts in order to allow for more comedy. They also cut out a large action scene at the end of the movie. This scene could have been added if not for the adding of a scene in the middle that was not part of the original book. Furthermore, the scene makes no sense because during which they destroy something that is key to the book in the seventh volume. Not only do they cut scenes, but they change others to suit what purpose you might ask? The unfortunate answer is I don't know. Another minor point that I noticed during the movie is, although there is not as much violence as previous movies the overall film includes adult content that in my opinion warrants the pg-13 rating.\n\nDo not misunderstand me. I recommend seeing the movie as it is enjoyable, but trying to change a masterpiece like J.K. Rowling's book is a mistake and I think this movie suffered from it. If I didn't have the book to reference I would've rated this movie an 8, but the simple fact is I do and it unfortunately falls short.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -- Trailer #3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1061421849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously \"This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince\" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.", "uploadDate": "2009-04-17T15:43:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0705356/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Daniel Radcliffe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0705356?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Harry Potter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0499270/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dave Legeno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0499270?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Fenrir Greyback"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000980/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jim Broadbent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0000980?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Professor Horace Slughorn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0942247/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bonnie Wright"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0942247?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ginny Weasley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0342488/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rupert Grint"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0342488?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ron Weasley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000307/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Helena Bonham Carter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0000307?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bellatrix Lestrange"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001758/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Timothy Spall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0001758?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Wormtail"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0962360/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Oliver Phelps"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0962360?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "George Weasley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002091/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Gambon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0002091?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Professor Albus Dumbledore"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2917590/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Elarica Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm2917590?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0813893/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Geraldine Somerville"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0813893?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lily Potter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0910278/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Julie Walters"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0910278?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Molly Weasley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0914612/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Emma Watson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0914612?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Hermione Granger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0567031/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Helen McCrory"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0567031?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Narcissa Malfoy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000614/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Alan Rickman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0417741/characters/nm0000614?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Professor Severus Snape"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["UK"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["15 July 2009 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["The Half-Blood Prince"], "Filming Locations": ["Wiltshire, England, UK"], "Budget": ["$250,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$77,835,727,", "19 July 2009"], "Gross USA": ["$302,305,431"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$934,454,096"], "Production Co": ["Warner Bros.", "Heyday Films"], "Runtime": ["153 min"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital", "SDDS", "DTS", "(DTS: X)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

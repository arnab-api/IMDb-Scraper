I was told going in that it was a terrible movie, but I should still watch it. While some people found how bad the movie is funny, I did not. I felt like I wasted my time watching this movie. I still would have never watched it if the Disaster Artist hadn't been nominated for an Oscar. I am told that if you watch this in the right atmosphere and with the right people, it can be quite an enjoyable watch. This was not the case for me. I am happy to say I watched it, I can understand what people are talking about now, but I wish they would talk about other movies.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Room", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1546846745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAzMDk0NjEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzYwMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAzMDk0NjEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzYwMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Johnny is a successful banker with great respect for and dedication to the people in his life, especially his future wife Lisa.

If you do so, you'll be obviously disappointed. Otherwise, it's a completely entertaining and fun ride through some surprisingly complex characters and an unexpectedly intricate game of cat and mouse.\n\nThere have been some comparisons of this movie to the movie Heat, and I think they may be somewhat warranted. OBVIOUSLY, this does not hold the gravitas of a mid-90's DeNiro/Pacino face-off, but plot structure, pacing, character development and the Los Angeles backdrop were all very familiar. \n\nAt the core, you have Pablo Schreiber, who is 1 or 2 decent movies away from being given a real shot at a career defining role. He led this film effortlessly and truly gives you a very raw sense of character. Gerard Butler plays Gerard Butler and convincingly so. The two square off for 140 minutes and it's surely fun to watch.\n\nThe 140 minute runtime seems to have garnered some attention from reviewers. Yeah, it's long, but it really doesn't feel that way. The pace of the film is stellar, and you never really feel any \"look down at your phone\" moments. The heist movie is often times full of overdone clich\u00e9s and unconvincing \"suspense\" but for some reason this film was able to put a fresh twist on everything you see. \n\nIf you've seen a trailer for the film, you'll be very happy with it. I think this is a case of extremely good marketing and a trailer can make or break your audience's expectations for a film. From the trailer, you see a crew of goons led by some wannabe badass and a crew of cops trying to intimidate them and take them down. The trailer doesn't give you much of a glimpse at anything more than elementary storyline, which is why if you see this film, you'll be pleasantly surprised. \n\nHad more fun in a theater than I can remember in recent years. \n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4118984729", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgyNWUxMTUtZDlkNS00NDFlLThkOGYtZWVmMGZhMzMzZmU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgyNWUxMTUtZDlkNS00NDFlLThkOGYtZWVmMGZhMzMzZmU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A gritty crime saga which follows the lives of an elite unit of the LA County Sheriff's Dept. and the state's most successful bank robbery crew as the outlaws plan a seemingly impossible heist on the Federal Reserve Bank.", "uploadDate": "2017-12-26T23:19:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124930/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gerard Butler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm0124930?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "'Big Nick' O'Brien"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6578009/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "O'Shea Jackson Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm6578009?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Donnie Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0816508/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Meadow Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm0816508?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Holly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0887144/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Brian Van Holt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm0887144?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Murph Connors"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0594895/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mo McRae"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm0594895?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gus Henderson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1685408/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dawn Olivieri"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm1685408?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Debbie O'Brien"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0108758/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jordan Bridges"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm0108758?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Lobbin' Bob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2415276/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Cooper Andrews"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm2415276?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mack"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1032567/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pablo Schreiber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm1032567?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ray Merrimen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1265067/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "50 Cent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm1265067?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Enson Levoux"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0173997/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maurice Compte"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm0173997?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Benny 'Borracho' Magalon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428055/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Evan Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm0428055?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bo 'Bosco' Ostroman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1839980/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kaiwi Lyman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm1839980?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "'Tony Z' Zapata"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000967/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Eric Braeden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm0000967?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ziggy Zerhusen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1167985/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lewis Tan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1259528/characters/nm1167985?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Secret Service Lobby Guard #1"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "Polynesian", "Spanish"], "Release Date": ["19 January 2018 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Den of Thieves"], "Filming Locations": ["Atlanta, Georgia, USA"], "Budget": ["$30,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$15,206,108,", "21 January 2018"], "Gross USA": ["$44,947,622"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$80,509,622"], "Production Co": ["STX Films", "Diamond Film Productions", "Tucker Tooley Entertainment"], "Runtime": ["140 min", "140 min", "(theatrical release)", "148 min", "(unrated DVD)"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

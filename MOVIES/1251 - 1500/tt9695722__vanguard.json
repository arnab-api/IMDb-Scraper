As well as expensive (though why so many of the CGI effects are so bad given what this movie must have cost, I have no idea). But it is senseless and ridiculous, even by the most lightweight fantasy-action-movie standards. It really feels like they said \"OK, we have about a dozen ideas here for generic ripoffs of other movies...hey, let's cram them all into ONE movie, and stick Jackie Chan on top!\" From one scene to the next, this film has no idea what it wants to be--so it tries everything, badly. I laughed out loud at some things that were meant to be taken seriously.\n\nI'm not sure bloodthirsty terrorists need to be heavily featured in a movie geared towards 10-year-olds, but that seems the approximate age group targeted here. Yet at the same time \"Vanguard\" isn't exactly a family film--or anything else, for more than a few minutes at a time. What it is, is a mess. A loud, expensive, busy mess that does Jackie no favors, or any of the younger cast members either.\n\nPlease note that if you click on their names, every single \"user\" here who gave \"Vanguard\" ten stars has mysteriously never reviewed another film, and only been on IMBD for a month. This movie flopped even in China, but Chinese bots sure are working overtime to try to push it here.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official U.S. Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi500482329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JkYWJjMWQtYjcyOS00MTEzLWI5YmEtN2I3OWI4NmM0MDZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JkYWJjMWQtYjcyOS00MTEzLWI5YmEtN2I3OWI4NmM0MDZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "Covert security company Vanguard is the last hope of survival for an accountant after he is targeted by the world's deadliest mercenary organization.", "uploadDate": "2020-11-02T16:28:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000329/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jackie Chan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm0000329?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tang Huating"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm8054476/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lun Ai"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm8054476?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zhang Kaixuan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11916315/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ruohan Xu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm11916315?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Fareeda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5647594/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Eyad Hourani"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm5647594?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Omar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6184064/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jianping Yang"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12038118/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Yanlong Wang"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2108976/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Desmond Aldridge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm2108976?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Yago"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3663916/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Can Aydin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm3663916?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Silver Fox"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3138511/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Yang Yang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm3138511?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lei Zhenyu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7094216/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Miya Muqi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm7094216?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mi Ya"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0514944/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jackson Lou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm0514944?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Qin Guoli"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10483676/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Zhengting Zhu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt9695722/characters/nm10483676?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Shendiao"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7055164/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bin Zhou"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11187030/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Wang Ju"}, "character_and_episodes": []}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm10550854/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nicole Atalla"}, "character_and_episodes": []}], "details": {"Country": ["China"], "Language": ["Mandarin", "English"], "Release Date": ["20 November 2020 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Vanguard"], "Filming Locations": ["Taiwan"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$380,428,", "22 November 2020"], "Gross USA": ["$793,525"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$50,814,965"], "Production Co": ["China Film (Shanghai) International Media Co.", "China Film Group Corporation (CFGC)", "Epitome Capital"], "Runtime": ["107 min"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39:1"]}}

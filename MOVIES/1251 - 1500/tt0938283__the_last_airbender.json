Night Shyamalan is tortuously  lethargic, uninvited, abysmal, and uniformly atrocious (in every  aspect). And that's me being nice!  Based on Nickelodeon's beloved animated series (to which I am only  vaguely familiar and thus can't compare) is set i a world in which the  population is divided amid the four elements (Earth, Wind, Water and  Fire) and some skilled practitioners whom can \"bend\" these elements to  their will. Since the elements are naturally at odds with each other,  an overall controller is needed to maintain order among the kingdom.  This role is played by the Avatar, who can manipulate all the elements  and thus can keep balance and peace amongst the tribes. Only problem is  this Avatar has gone missing for 100 hundred years.  \"The Last Airbender\" follows a brother and sister from the Water Tribe,  Sokka (Jackson Rathbone) and Katara (Nicola Peltz), who discover a  12-year-old monk-child from the Air tribe frozen in a block of ice and  his gigantic furry steed (that resembles the luck dragon in \"The Never  Ending Story\").His name is Aang (Noah Ringer), and he, of course is the  missing Avatar. Now freed, he finds his home air tribe are all dead and  the rest of the world in turmoil. All at the hands of the tyranny of  the dreaded Fire Nation. Aang, who never wanted to be the Avatar in the  first place (thus why he ran away) must step up, lead a resistance and  bring peace back to the Kingdom. However, he must first learn how to  control the elements other than air (was imprisoned by an ice storm  before he could train). The Fire nation led by Lord Ozai (Cliff Curtis)  wants none of this of course and seeks to capture and subdue Aang (they  would just kill him but he'd just get reincarnated). Rounding out the  plot is Ozai's son, Prince Zuko (Dev Patel), living in exile with his  uncle Iroh (Shaun Toub), who also wants to capture Aang and bring him  back to his father to win his honor back.  Sound like a lot? It is, but surprisingly not as convoluted as it  sounds. The scope of the plot, which attempts at mysticism, politics,  religion and a whole obvious Jesus angle isn't the problem. Its how the  story is told that makes it unbearable. It throws a lot at you with no  effect. It fails definition and lacks resonance. Everything is rushed.  Characters and story elements are given no development. Take the Fire  Nation for example. We are told they are scourge of the once unified  kingdom but we arn't shown this. They travel the globe in their  ominous, menacing, iron ships and have a mightier than though attitude  but all in all nothing that establishes their evil-ness; albeit a later  incident with a glowing pond guppy. Because of this we have nothing at  stake, no reason to root for the good guys to triumph. Another example  would be a big part of Aang's journey. Which involves him letting go of  his anger towards the genocide of his people (a scene depicting said  genocide would have helped sell the fire nation's douchey-ness) but we  never see him get angry enough to make \"letting go\" have meaning.  Void-ness of emotional moments are what really plague this film. I  would blame this on the script but the performances are what make it  not work. Every actor in this film (minus Shaun Toub) delivers dialogue  as if they were reading it for the very first time. Not one thing  anyone says carries any weight, none of it resonates emotionally. To  say the actors suffer from wooden acting would be insult an to wood.  It seem Shyamalan seemed much more interested in the visuals than the  narrative (or the dialogue, which is shoddy at best). M. Night manages  a few striking images, most of them involving otherworldly landscapes  and ornate set design. There are strong special effects and action  sequences which are fluid and vivid. Particularly with the fights  involving element- manipulation. Winds gusts slamming people around  like rag dolls, earth barricades, globs or walls of water and so on are  eye popping. The effects are top notch. The hand-to-hand, Kung-Fu fight  sequences are well choreographed as well, but a bit too extraneous.  Should also mention that this movie is available in 3D and lets just  say it's a wasted element (pun intended), an unnecessary afterthought.  It wrecks whatever visual grace that might have been (and will give you  a massive headache).  Though, relatively successful in cinematic aspects Shyamalan, overall  fails to capture the sense of adventure. There is a signs of a  beautiful journey but it ultimately falls flat.  Underwhelming and joyless Avatar: The Last Airbender is sure the be the  final nail in the coffin of M. Night Shymalans stunted career.  M. Night Shyamalan: Fool me once? Shame on you. Fool me four times?  \"The Sixth Sense\" was clearly a fluke."}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Last Airbender - \"Rebellion\" TV Spot", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi105187097", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMzc4NDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIxNTU1Mw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExMzc4NDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIxNTU1Mw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Last Airbender - \"Rebellion\" TV Spot", "uploadDate": "2010-06-09T13:49:25Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3226241/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Noah Ringer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm3226241?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Aang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2443758/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nicola Peltz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm2443758?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Katara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0869467/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Shaun Toub"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm0869467?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Uncle Iroh"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0193295/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Cliff Curtis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm0193295?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Fire Lord Ozai"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0396455/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Katharine Houghton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm0396455?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Katara's Grandma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0348515/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Damon Gupton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm0348515?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Monk Gyatso"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0453641/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Randall Duk Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm0453641?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Old Man in Temple"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1692978/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Keong Sim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm1692978?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Earthbending Father"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2353862/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dev Patel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm2353862?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Prince Zuko"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1717152/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jackson Rathbone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm1717152?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sokka"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0541902/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Aasif Mandvi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm0541902?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Commander Zhao"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2437267/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Seychelle Gabriel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm2437267?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Princess Yue"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0347341/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Francis Guinan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm0347341?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Master Pakku"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1974397/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Summer Bishil"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm1974397?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Azula"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1428359/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "John D'Alonzo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0938283/characters/nm1428359?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Zhao's Assistant"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["1 July 2010 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Avatar: The Last Airbender"], "Filming Locations": ["Delaware Generating Station, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA"], "Budget": ["$150,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$40,325,019,", "4 July 2010"], "Gross USA": ["$131,772,187"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$319,713,881"], "Production Co": ["Paramount Pictures", "Nickelodeon Movies", "Blinding Edge Pictures"], "Runtime": ["103 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital", "Dolby Surround 7.1", "DTS", "SDDS", "Sonics-DDP"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.35 : 1"]}}

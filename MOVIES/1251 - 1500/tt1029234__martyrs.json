Like \"High Tension\" and \"Inside\" before it, \"Martyrs\" is the latest film to be subjected to a wealth of internet hype and to gain significant notoriety in the states, especially for a foreign film. But as director Pascal Laugier states in his introduction on the DVD, the film was merely an experiment in cinema and subsequently will evoke a reaction in any viewer, whether it's a positive or a negative one.\n\nThat's pretty much the story of \"Martyrs,\" a tricky film that is part revenge, part cerebral thriller. While it lacks the visceral punch of other films it's been compared to, the film is perhaps one of the most ambitious in recent years. In his film, Laugier shows many influences ranging from the works of Stanley Kubrick to even \"Hellraiser\" (a film which the director was briefly attached to remake recently), but integrates them all into a film that is unmistakably his own. Blatantly going out of his way to avoid typical film clich\u00e9s and over-done visual-effects, Laugier's film presents itself as bluntly and realistically as possible. The way the film is shot is very matter-of-fact, showing the extreme violence exactly as it is. The lack of stylization is a style all its own, giving the film its own unmistakable and dreadful atmosphere. All of this is driven home with intense performances from its two leads \u2013 Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi -- who go a long way to invoke sympathy in the audience and establish a very human factor that is important to the film's credibility, especially when it reaches ridiculous heights in the third act.\n\nWhere \"Martyrs\" is heavy on the violence and dread, its problems stem from its severe lack of focus. The film shifts gears very sharply in its final act, and the build-up that precedes it is nearly destroyed. The very visceral first two-thirds of the film seem to have been forsaken for an ending that will leave many scratching their heads, wondering what kind of film they just saw. The ending itself is bold and will incite conversation long after the credits have rolled, but doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the movie. To put it simply, \"Martyrs\" is two movies in one, and unfortunately, its final act doesn't do the film justice. Having said that, however, \"Martyrs\" is still a bold and very unique experience in film, one that any horror fan (or anyone in general) should see for themselves in order to develop their own opinion. This is truly one film that will be interpreted differently by everyone, and in spite of its obvious flaws, won't soon be forgotten.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1662011/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Morjana Alaoui"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm1662011?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Anna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0126743/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Catherine B\u00e9gin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm0126743?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mademoiselle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0876312/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Patricia Tulasne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm0876312?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "La m\u00e8re"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0230859/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Xavier Dolan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm0230859?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Antoine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597629/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jean-Marie Moncelet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm0597629?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "\u00c9tienne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2930099/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Erika Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm2930099?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Anna 10 ans"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2902169/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Emilie Miskdjian"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm2902169?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "La supplici\u00e9e"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1116228/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Anie Pascale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm1116228?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "La femme bourreau"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1227864/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Myl\u00e8ne Jampano\u00ef"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm1227864?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lucie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0869590/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Robert Toupin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm0869590?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Le p\u00e8re"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1492850/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Juliette Gosselin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm1492850?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0092411/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Louise Boisvert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm0092411?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "M\u00e8re d'Anna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2893112/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jessie Pham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm2893112?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Lucie 10 ans"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0153914/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Isabelle Chasse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm0153914?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "La cr\u00e9ature"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0732274/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tony Robinow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1029234/characters/nm0732274?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Docteur"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["France", "Canada"], "Language": ["French"], "Release Date": ["3 September 2008 (France)"], "Also Known As": ["Martyrs"], "Filming Locations": ["Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"], "Budget": ["EUR3,390,000", "(estimated)"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$1,149,138"], "Production Co": ["Eskwad", "Wild Bunch", "TCB Film"], "Runtime": ["99 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Dolby Digital"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.85 : 1"]}}

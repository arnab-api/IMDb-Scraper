Closest things to Anime prior that I watched were Avatar: The Last Airbender (Some don't really consider it anime as its American, but its based off it) and if you count movies, Spirited Away. But back on topic.\n\nAfter my friend showed me game-play of Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment, I decided to check out the series on Netflix and I was instantly hooked. It was humorous at times, very deep and emotional, and really epic. The characters are likable, the story is amazing, the music, score and theme songs, awesome.\n\nI understand that a lot of people don't like the show, and I see the reasons why. I was disappointed when the First Story Arc came to what seemed like a sudden and rather quick end (Which is the reasoning behind me not giving the show a perfect 10 score). I honestly wouldn't have had a problem with different Story Arcs if the first season had focused on just one (Much like ABC's Once Upon a Time, because I think the Story Arcs were rather good.\n\nBut overall, I am really glad that I got into the show. It may not be perfect, but I liked it and I really look forward to Sword Art Online 3 as well as the movie (that is, if they have officially been announced rather than rumored)when they come out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sword Art Online: Alicization Lycoris", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1316339225", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y0MTQxMzktZTM0Ni00MmExLWJmZmEtMDU2YTUxZDAyZjQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y0MTQxMzktZTM0Ni00MmExLWJmZmEtMDU2YTUxZDAyZjQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Launch Trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-07-22T17:02:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4303311/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Yoshitsugu Matsuoka"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2250192/characters/nm4303311?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kirito"}, {"url": "#", "name": "86 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0745310/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bryce Papenbrook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2250192/characters/nm0745310?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kirito"}, {"url": "#", "name": "47 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2955927/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Haruka Tomatsu"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2250192/characters/nm2955927?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Asuna"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0473873/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Cherami Leigh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2250192/characters/nm0473873?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Asuna"}, {"url": "#", "name": "44 episodes, 2012-2020"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["Japan"], "Language": ["Japanese"], "Release Date": ["8 July 2012 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Sao"], "Filming Locations": ["Tokyo, Japan"], "Production Co": ["A-1 Pictures", "ASCII Mediaworks", "Aniplex"], "Runtime": ["24 min"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["16:9 HD"]}}

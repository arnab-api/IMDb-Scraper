When i heard a TV show is coming, i thought that they will not be able to pull off the madness, the pacing, the characters etc, so, they will change many things. I was angry at first, then slowly i started to get used to the idea that i will not see a page by page adaptation, but a more loose one. Then, the pilot came. Boom. I can write a million things about the changes they made, which ones i think work and which don't, but it doesn't matter that much. I can write about how good Cassidy, Jesse and Tulip were on the TV show (they were great), but it doesn't matter to me that much either. The pilot was a pretty good episode on its own, fun, crazy, fast, intriguing, with good characters and a great cast, cool music, nice photography and direction, good writing etc. However, what truly matters to me, is that the love of the creators for the source material(the comic book, duh), was apparent everywhere and all the time. The pilot was made of love. They seem to know the comic book, to understand and love it, and to really want to make this adaptation work.

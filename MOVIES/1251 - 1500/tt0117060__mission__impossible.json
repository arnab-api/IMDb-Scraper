The fact that so many people have complained that they \"didn't get it\" is proof that our brains are being atrophied by so many movies that do all our thinking for us. I had no trouble in following the plot and found the fact that I actually had to concentrate and think things through quite refreshing. Okay, so a lot of the stunts were a bit far fetched but what does it matter when they were so entertaining? After all, it is only a movie; nobody expects us to believe that these things could really happen any more than they expect us to believe that King Kong really existed or that there's a Volcano ready to errupt in L.A. Besides, with the inspired casting of David Schneider as the train driver, Brian de Palma must have had his tongue in his cheek for at least some of the time. He's created a masterful boy's own adventure story, an original \"ripping yarn\" and that brilliant comic touch added to this perfectly.\n\n\"Mission Impossible\" is a visual and cerebral treat. Tom Cruise is excellent as Ethan, Vanessa Redgrave makes a superb villian and Jean Reno is watchable in ANYTHING he does. The only weak link is Emmanuelle Beart, who did a good job of looking beautiful but very little else. What a shame Kristin Scott Thomas couldn't have taken a more central role; she makes the gorgeous but bland Beart look like a waste of space.\n\nI give this 8 out of ten and it would have been more if it wasn't for Beart's character.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mission: Impossible", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3226468377", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI2NjUyYjEtNzhiMy00ZGM4LTliNWQtM2ZkYjgwMGVmYjg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTI2NjUyYjEtNzhiMy00ZGM4LTliNWQtM2ZkYjgwMGVmYjg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Paramount", "uploadDate": "2008-10-30T03:30:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000129/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Cruise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0000129?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ethan Hunt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000322/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Emmanuelle B\u00e9art"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0000322?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Claire"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000606/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jean Reno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0000606?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Krieger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000218/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kristin Scott Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0000218?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sarah Davies"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0200848/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ingeborga Dapkunaite"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0200848?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hannah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0890874/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Marek Vasut"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0890874?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Drunken Male IMF Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0572349/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "John McLaughlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0572349?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "TV Interviewer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0229859/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Karel Dobr\u00fd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0229859?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Matthias"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000685/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jon Voight"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0000685?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jim Phelps"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001089/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Henry Czerny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0001089?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kittridge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000609/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ving Rhames"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0000609?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Luther"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000603/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Vanessa Redgrave"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0000603?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Max"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0945118/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Valentina Yakunina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0945118?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Drunken Female IMF Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0651879/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nathan Osgood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0651879?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Kittridge Technician"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0768350/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Rolf Saxon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117060/characters/nm0768350?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "CIA Analyst William Donloe"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English", "French", "Czech"], "Release Date": ["22 May 1996 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Mission: Impossible"], "Filming Locations": ["Old Town Square, Old Town, Prague, Czech Republic"], "Budget": ["$80,000,000", "(estimated)"], "Opening Weekend USA": ["$45,436,830,", "26 May 1996"], "Gross USA": ["$180,981,856"], "Cumulative Worldwide Gross": ["$457,696,391"], "Production Co": ["Paramount Pictures", "Cruise/Wagner Productions"], "Runtime": ["110 min"], "Sound Mix": ["DTS", "Dolby Digital", "SDDS"], "Aspect Ratio": ["2.39 : 1"]}}

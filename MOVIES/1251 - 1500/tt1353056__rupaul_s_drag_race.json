I watched it by accident one day (season three mid episode) and I thought it was a normal beauty pageant show... then the camera went back stage and my mind took a minute to process... wait what? WHAT?!?!\n\nSo what's the verdict? I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! not only is everything done tastefully and with a lot of dignity attached to it, it also manages to do that with a lot of fun and not taking itself too seriously. \n\nThe show Humanizes the people on it so you don't see a \"drag queen\" you see the contestants. (Raven you will always be my fav!) at their best and not so best. each bigger then life and an entertainer at heart.\n\nRupaul keeps it interesting with lots of fun little twists and event and the clothes (and the shoes, oh god the shoes!!!) are always beautiful.\n\nI love that the show celebrates different body types, they're not all skinny and tall blondes, curvy girls have a real shot here and some you'll fall in love with.\n\nRight now this show is by far the best American reality TV show there is. which queen will you root for this season?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 13 Teaser", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2217591065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MzNGUzYTQtY2I1YS00NzI2LTk1MjgtMGFmMDZjMmUzZmUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MzNGUzYTQtY2I1YS00NzI2LTk1MjgtMGFmMDZjMmUzZmUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg", "description": "RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race ruveals jaw-dropping twist in Season 13 premiere.", "uploadDate": "2020-12-15T16:25:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0750412/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "RuPaul"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1353056/characters/nm0750412?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Host"}, {"url": "#", "name": "179 episodes, 2009-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0899513/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michelle Visage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1353056/characters/nm0899513?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Self - Judge"}, {"url": "#", "name": "151 episodes, 2011-2021"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["2 February 2009 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["RuPaul's Drag Race"], "Filming Locations": ["Los Angeles, California, USA"], "Production Co": ["World of Wonder Productions"], "Runtime": ["63 min"]}}

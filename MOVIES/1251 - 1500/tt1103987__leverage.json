Well worth watching!", "reviewBody": "It usually takes me about three episodes of a new series to decide if it's worth continuing to watch. With \"Leverage\" I was hooked after the first 15 minutes. I think it's because it seemed to be an amalgam of some of my favorite TV shows of the past. This includes \"The Equalizer\" (righting wrongs using unconventional methods), \"Mission Impossible\" (the TV series)(putting a great team together to work towards a common goal), and \"Banicek\" (solving seemingly perfect crimes).\n\nWhat I really like about it is the team. It is made up of very independent individuals who are master criminals. The key is how they have been enticed to work for Nathan Ford (Timothy Hutton's character). They all contribute to the cause and, because of it, find they are a very powerful force that can get them more of what they are looking for. There is also a camaraderie that I haven't seen in a long, long time.\n\nWhat I also like about this show is that it is not dark and seedy. While there is violence, it is not gratuitous. And, so far, there have been no plot lines that involve stalkers or other misogynistic individuals. One can only hope it continues that way.\n\nWhile there are great special effects, great sets, great actors and great acting, etc., I find that it is the writers who deserve the lions share of praise for concocting such an enjoyable storyline.\n\nI am REALLY looking forward to more \"Leverage\" episodes! 10 out of 10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Are You Drunk?", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1261503257", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMDU2MzkwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI5MzkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMDU2MzkwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI5MzkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A video clip from the TNT original series \"Leverage,\" airing Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT", "uploadDate": "2009-01-27T13:00:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000459/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Timothy Hutton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1103987/characters/nm0000459?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nathan Ford"}, {"url": "#", "name": "77 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0437283/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Christian Kane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1103987/characters/nm0437283?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eliot Spencer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "77 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388038/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Aldis Hodge"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1103987/characters/nm0388038?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alec Hardison"}, {"url": "#", "name": "77 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0069109/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gina Bellman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1103987/characters/nm0069109?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sophie Devereaux"}, {"url": "#", "name": "77 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0726360/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Beth Riesgraf"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1103987/characters/nm0726360?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Parker"}, {"url": "#", "name": "77 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}], "details": {"Country": ["USA"], "Language": ["English"], "Release Date": ["7 December 2008 (USA)"], "Also Known As": ["Leverage"], "Filming Locations": ["Chicago, Illinois, USA"], "Production Co": ["Electric Entertainment"], "Sound Mix": ["Stereo"], "Aspect Ratio": ["1.78 : 1"]}}

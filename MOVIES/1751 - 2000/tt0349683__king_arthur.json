It's great to see the knights in shining armor and Merlin conjuring up the mists and casting spells, and the young Arthur pulling Excalibur out of the stone.\n\nBut I went into this movie with an open mind. I was swiftly transported to that earlier time and happy for the journey. I could see where the elements of the now oh-so-familiar Arthurian themes may have had their beginnings. I found the on-screen chemistry between Ioan Gruffod and Clive Owen to be very powerful and it provided poignant counterpoint to Lancelot's most fateful choice.\n\nThe love triangle was never my favorite part of the Arthurian legends, so the subtle treatment of it here didn't bother me at all. In fact, I found it more intriguing in this film than in any other King Arthur movie I've seen.\n\nI loved that there was no hocus-pocus-type magic. Instead the magic was in nature itself - the landscapes, the forests, the rain, the fog, the ice and snow - all creating an other-worldly atmosphere along with Moya Brennan's haunting vocals and Hans Zimmer's stirring score.\n\nI loved the knights. I loved the idea that they were just regular guys and, in effect, drafted into military service. Not the privileged elite who volunteered their services to a king. Yet it is apparent that the Sarmatian knights fought more out of their love and respect for Arthur than any duty to Rome. That comraderie feels very organic and the sentiments, pure. I liked that they're not all wearing the same uniform, that they might have picked up pieces here and there as spoils of war.\n\nI was especially captivated by Mads Mikkelson's Tristan. There appeared to be Eastern influences in his tattoos, clothing, sword, and fighting style. I love the idea of Lancelot using two swords. And I learned something about battlefield strategy, too.\n\nWhatever shortcomings this movie may have, I found heart and soul in it. It was not only entertaining, it touched all my senses, and I felt good when I walked out of the theatre.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "King Arthur", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1423900953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2UyNTU1MzktMjZkOS00MjdhLWIyNTAtODlmNWZkZGU2ZmVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2UyNTU1MzktMjZkOS00MjdhLWIyNTAtODlmNWZkZGU2ZmVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Director's Cut TV Post", "uploadDate": "2008-08-04T03:27:50Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0654110/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Clive Owen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0654110?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Arthur"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0586568/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mads Mikkelsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0586568?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tristan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0199215/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hugh Dancy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0199215?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Galahad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829032/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ray Stevenson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0829032?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dagonet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0226820/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Stephen Dillane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0226820?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Merlin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001709/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Til Schweiger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0001709?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cynric"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0454361/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Pat Kinevane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0454361?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Horton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0832792/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ken Stott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0832792?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Marius Honorius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0344435/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ioan Gruffudd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0344435?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lancelot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0249291/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Joel Edgerton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0249291?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gawain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0935653/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ray Winstone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0935653?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bors"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461136/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Keira Knightley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0461136?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Guinevere"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001745/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0001745?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cerdic"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0318409/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sean Gilder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0318409?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Jols"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0546515/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ivano Marescotti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0349683/characters/nm0546515?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bishop Germanius"}]}]}

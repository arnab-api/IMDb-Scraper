A fall release with a target audience of Gleeks. It didn't seem to have the legs to get anywhere, but those who saw it understood and spread the word. No one believed in it, yet it became an instant classic. I saw Pitch Perfect no less than 5 times in theaters (but I did work in a movie theater, so I did not pay 5 times to see it). I fell in love with the movie, and so did everyone I dragged along with me to see it.\n\nAnd now we are in the day and age where any slightly successful movie gets more money thrown at it to make a slightly less entertaining sequel (that was never in the cards to begin with). When the sequel to Pitch Perfect 2 was announced, I was on the fence. PP was wrapped up in a neat tiny little box, and it didn't need anything else to come along and ruin it.\n\nThen it got worse. They announced at some point that the Green Bay Packers were going to be in it. I went on a tirade. OK, maybe I wasn't throwing things and kicking puppies, but I was very vocal online and to my family about how they ruined any potential this movie had by putting the worst football team in the history of the world in this movie, with Clay Matthews being at the forefront of the group. (I tell everyone who will listen that if I had $10,000, I would pay someone much stronger than me to punch him in the face, while I sneak behind him and cut off his hair). \n\nSo all of my excitement for this sequel went from a somewhat decent flame to a dying ember. The movie was coming out during a summer of blockbusters that had me so excited I felt like I could vomit (seriously, before Avengers: Age of Ultron started I thought I could vomit while sitting there waiting for trailers to start because I was so excited). \n\nBut PP2 stayed on my mind, and last week I got the opportunity to sign up for a advance screening, and last night I got into that advance screening. Outside the theater they were giving away PP2 branded cups (ha) if you took a selfie with the poster and shared it. So obviously I did that. (cut to the next time someone is in my apartment, sees that cup, and i immediately start my horrible rendition of cups). PP2 has the same formula as the first one. This time the Bellas are a bit more successful, but they hit a snag at the beginning and have to rebuild their team. Beca is the leader of the group, but she is also worried about her future (cue future distance and drama in the group). The Bellas can't audition new members (and with their current ban from Collegiate Acapella), the group filled with graduating seniors (and super, super, super seniors) looks doomed. \n\nThe movie gets off to a slow start plot-wise. But that doesn't stop the jokes from coming hard and fast. I found myself laughing at almost every line in the movie. There isn't a single one that doesn't have a little hint of a zinger. \n\nElizabeth Bank's full-length film directorial debut proves that she knows comedy (as if we didn't already know that) and that the cast knows how to deliver that comedy. We have all of our favorites back and each story line does not disappoint. The few new additions are pretty great too. \n\nHailee Steinfeld as Bella legacy Emily proves that if they want to continue the franchise, they have some pretty good fresh meat in her. \n\nAnd much like the first movie, the best lines and overall awesomeness comes from Rebel Wilson as the aca-amazing Fat Amy. She does not disappoint, and though some people may feel that Rebel plays the same character in everything she does, I really don't care because she makes me laugh. Every. Damn. Time. \n\nThis movie is full of surprises. And the damn Green Bay Packers made me laugh harder than I thought possible (but for good measure, in-between each laugh I did say 'F*** you, Clay Matthews). Also to note, I live in Chicago, saw the screening in Chicago, and I was not the only person who booed when the Packers were introduced.\n\nI feel like if I were to go into anymore detail, I would spoil some of the best bits of the movie for you, so let me sum it up in this final little bit: PP2 is a good time. You need to be a fan of the first one, don't go in thinking that maybe you will like this even if you didn't like PP. You are wrong, you will hate it. But those of you that love or even mildly liked the first one will get a kick out of this. I laughed so hard at one point (that involved Fat Amy and Bumper (Adam Devine)) that I was unable to breath. It was brilliant.\n\nBetter than the original? Debatable. Worth seeing in theaters? 100% yes.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Global Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1579003417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc2ODI0MjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE0MTE0NDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After getting suspended from the ICCAs, the Barden Bellas must win the World Championships -- an international competition that no American team has ever won -- in order to be reinstated.", "uploadDate": "2015-02-11T11:07:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0447695/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Anna Kendrick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm0447695?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Beca"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2794962/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hailee Steinfeld"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2794962?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Emily"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2799457/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Skylar Astin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2799457?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jesse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005408/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Katey Sagal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm0005408?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Katherine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4805317/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ben Platt"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm4805317?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Benji"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2443438/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hana Mae Lee"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2443438?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Lilly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2610425/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Chrissie Fit"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2610425?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Flo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2887579/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Flula Borg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2887579?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Pieter Kr\u00e4mer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2313103/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rebel Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2313103?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Fat Amy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0811242/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brittany Snow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm0811242?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chloe"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2796745/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Adam Devine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2796745?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bumper"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2319871/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Anna Camp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2319871?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Aubrey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3625065/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Alexis Knapp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm3625065?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Stacie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3637636/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ester Dean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm3637636?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Cynthia Rose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2171898/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2848292/characters/nm2171898?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kommissar"}]}]}

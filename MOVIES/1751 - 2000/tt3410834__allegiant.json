Was \"Allegiant\" the movie perfect? No. Not by a long shot. It obliterated and basically stripped many of the complex and more interesting layers that brought the characters body and soul in the book. We were left with a very skeletal, fractured and less interesting story. The movie did veer from the original work quite a bit but the substance of the story was still there...it wasn't lost. We still get the point of what the purpose of the experiment cities were designed for. We get the struggle for power and the fight for humanity to fight for its survival against what seems like insurmountable odds. We get the theme of loyalty and family, ambition and greed vs sacrifice and selflessness. All the elements are there.\n\nWas I annoyed that this movie is part 1 of 2? Not really. I look forward to seeing how the writers and director will adjust the story. Many fans were unhappy with the ending of the book anyway and would like to see it fixed. We'll have to wait and see if the powers that be stick to Veronica Roth's vision or create an alternate. But really, there is no need to feel disappointed or distraught. It is after all an adaptation! \n\nTheo James as Four was awesome, though I felt his character wasn't given much substance in this flick, still he was fun to watch. Bill Skarsgard who played Matthew was a nice surprise. I loved every scene he was in and Miles Teller stole the show as the always self-serving jerk, Peter. We didn't get much from Zoe Kravitz and Maggie Q was great as Tori. Shailene Woodley was OK. She could only work with what she was given. But the fellas carried this movie from beginning to end. Even Jeff Daniels had his moments.\n\nOverall, I thought it was entertaining. Not perfect but I give it a pass.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3709973785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjczODk4ODEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTkyNDgxODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjczODk4ODEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTkyNDgxODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Beatrice Prior and Tobias Eaton venture into the world outside of the fence and are taken into protective custody by a mysterious agency known as the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.", "uploadDate": "2016-03-01T10:16:48Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0940362/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Shailene Woodley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm0940362?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915208/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Naomi Watts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm0915208?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Evelyn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001099/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jeff Daniels"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm0001099?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5052065/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ansel Elgort"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm5052065?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Caleb"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2920533/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Keiynan Lonsdale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm2920533?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Uriah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0702572/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Maggie Q"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm0702572?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tori"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4103976/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jonny Weston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm4103976?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Edgar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2811167/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Andy Bean"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm2811167?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Romit"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3772243/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Theo James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm3772243?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Four"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0818055/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Octavia Spencer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm0818055?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Johanna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2368789/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Zo\u00eb Kravitz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm2368789?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Christina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1886602/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Miles Teller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm1886602?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Peter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0196654/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Daniel Dae Kim"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm0196654?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jack Kang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0803889/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm0803889?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Matthew"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3758734/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nadia Hilker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3410834/characters/nm3758734?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nita"}]}]}

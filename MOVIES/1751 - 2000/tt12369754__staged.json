No great feat; they're only 15 minute episodes--and that's part of its charm. David Tennant and Michael Sheen are two more reasons to watch this series. It's not fair to say that they play themselves. Rather, they're playing caricatures of themselves.\n\nThis series watches their interactions as they struggle with cabin fever during lockdown. If you've ever wondered what celebrities are like when they're at home, this is a whimsical glimpse behind the curtain. While the boys are acting like petulant children, the women, all women in this series, are strong, understanding, and intelligent, which grounds the story emotionally. In one scene, David walks in and sits down next to his wife (played by his real-life wife Georgia), smiles, and simply says, \"Thank you.\" She lovingly returns a knowing smile.\n\nThe writing is witty but not pretentious. It assumes that the audience is paying attention. There are several plot threads that run the length of the series. If you're not paying attention, or if you don't watch the episodes in quick succession, you're in danger of missing much of the humour and even losing the plot. A lot is left for the audience to connect the dots, so pay attention to everything, including the credits (a running gag throughout). With 15 minute episodes, it's easy to fly through the series in one sitting.\n\nGreat acting, great writing, timely storylines, witty, but short and sweet. What more can I say, except: if you like quality, smart, enjoyable television, this one's a winner.\n\nOne warning, though. If you're offended by profanity, you'd best give this one a miss.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3516186905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyOTY2OWMtNmMyMC00YmVlLWIxOTItOTIzYzAyMjkwMDNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyOTY2OWMtNmMyMC00YmVlLWIxOTItOTIzYzAyMjkwMDNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "David Tennant and Michael Sheen star as two actors whose West End play has been put on hold due to Covid-19, but whose director has persuaded them to carry on rehearsing online.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-28T12:26:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0790688/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Sheen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm0790688?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Sheen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0595634/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Georgia Tennant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm0595634?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Georgia Tennant"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6463004/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lucy Eaton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm6463004?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lucy Eaton"}, {"url": "#", "name": "7 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000155/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Whoopi Goldberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm0000155?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6452929/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rebecca Gage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm6452929?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Janine"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0855039/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Tennant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm0855039?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Tennant"}, {"url": "#", "name": "14 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5012245/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anna Lundberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm5012245?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Anna Lundberg"}, {"url": "#", "name": "12 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0815317/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nina Sosanya"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm0815317?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "4 episodes, 2020-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2355635/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ben Schwartz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt12369754/characters/nm2355635?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tom"}, {"url": "#", "name": "3 episodes, 2021"}]}]}

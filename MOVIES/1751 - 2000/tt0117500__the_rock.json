Directed by Michael Bay. Running time: 135 minutes. Rated R (for strong intense violence, language and brief sexuality)\n\nNotes taken while screening The Rock:\n\n\u00b7 The film contains superior character development of both the antagonist and protagonist. Each is clear and well defined. We also learn the characters motives, reasoning, dramatic situation, and premise--all brilliantly introduced within the setup.\n\n\u00b7 Sean Connery provides us with strong character development through John Patrick Mason--although the character is somewhat a rip off of the Anthony Hokins' Hannibal from \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\n\u00b7 It is uncanny how well the movie's visual style works. It propels the film's suspense the extra mile, increasing the tension and enticement. Also contributing to the style is the fitting soundtrack.\n\n\u00b7 Some of the events are excessively coincidental. For example, during an exciting chase scene, Mason dashes out of a building, escaping the clutches of concealing police, discovering a Hum-V seemingly awaiting his arrival. Experienced chemist, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), chases after him, in a high speed Ferrari  sitting outside his position in a building. Another coincidence occurs in the high security prison, where Mason escapes a grenade blast by dashing at random into a room, where, of course, there just so happens to be a secure bathtub to climb in. \n\n\u00b7 There is a stolid, aggressively effective cast present. Each actor contributes a taut, penetrating performance, especially Ed Harris as the film's villain, General Francis X. Hummel who demands a moral purpose holding the lives of an urban area at stake.\n\n* The character's motives and perfectly defined, especially General Francis X. Hummel.  Even as the film's bad guy, he serves an understandable position, thus we empathize with him, unlike most villains witnessed in modern day thrillers.\n\n\u00b7 The standard three act structure is flawless: each scene propels the plot forward. The sequences either create a new problem or complicate a previous conflict, favoring with the later concept. This raises the line of tension even further.\n\n\u00b7 Most of the production takes place in a high security prison, Alcatraz, crafted with a complex, awe-inspiring atmosphere towering over that of most action movies.\n\n\u00b7 Sean Connery handles the complicated role of John Mason with mere simplicity, yet easily torments the audience with a sense of omniscient knowledge of the plot.\n\n\u00b7 The picture is unpredictable and contains several inducing and unexpected twists proving this movie is imaginative and free to surprise us. The conclusion is not fomulatic. \"The Rock\" is filled with artful design and crafty performances. It is one of the year's best action films.\n\nBrought to you by  Hollywood Pictures.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H16M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2429731097", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWQ3YTI5MTItYmY1My00MjBjLWExN2EtZGVlNDVmN2IxZWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWdhbWF6b2E@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWQ3YTI5MTItYmY1My00MjBjLWExN2EtZGVlNDVmN2IxZWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWdhbWF6b2E@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-10-31T13:35:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000125/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sean Connery"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117500/characters/nm0000125?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Patrick Mason"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000438/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ed Harris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117500/characters/nm0000438?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "General Francis X.

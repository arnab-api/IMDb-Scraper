The 'girl who finds out she is a princess' story, has been most certainly covered, but this makes you forget about it being a fairy tale clich\u00e9.\n\nAll thanks to Anne Hathaway, who just sizzled as Mia \u0096 her cool/ funny tone of voice and personality, just made her picture perfect. It was as is she was just born to play it. In the end, this movie ranked no.19 in the top 20 movie list of the year 2001, grossing more than 100 million at the box office\u0085.something which it completely deserved. Julie Andrews, makes a sudden re-appearance as Queen Clarise. Though she does fit perfectly to what the casting director's envisage of the Queen, there is something that does not fit, to make it perfect. However, that does not stop anyone from not enjoying the movie and having fun. Mandy Moore's debut performance\u0085well was HORRIBLE (listen to her cover version of 'Stupid Cupid'- its even worst than her acting)! But because Anne Hathaway's character was brought out with a lot of strength, all these minor faults seemed invisible. Hector Elizondo was equally good as the chauffeur Joe. He had wit and the personality. Heather Matarazzo always plays a freak, and in this case, it is still the same.\n\nThis may be a kiddie movie, but I believe it was made for everyone to enjoy it- and it did serve it's purpose. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH and would make a great recommendation, for anyone who just wants to make movie night fun."}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3776691737", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg3YWRhMzgtNjMyYS00MWM1LThhOTUtMTJhODBjMDU2MjlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg3YWRhMzgtNjMyYS00MWM1LThhOTUtMTJhODBjMDU2MjlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Mia Thermopolis has just found out that she is the heir apparent to the throne of Genovia.

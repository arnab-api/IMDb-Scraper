Morgan Tookers (Ike Barinholtz), Beverly (Beth Grant), Betsy Putch (Zoe Jarman) and Tamra (Xosha Roquemore) are the nurses.\n\nWith Mindy Kaling coming off of her memorable role in The Office, I was expecting something much better than the usual network fare. She has a few interesting takes but this is mostly the regular single-gal-in-the-city show. The most outrageous thing here is that she's a minority actor in the lead of a regular show. She doesn't really play up that fact. Other than a brother, her family aspect isn't used much. She plays up her chubbiness more than her ethnicity. Mindy does struggle from time to time to find the flow. Her revolving door of relationships does leave me scratching my head a little. However that happens in single gal shows all the time. My minor complaint is that this is not as daring as I hoped but it is still very good with excellent writing. After 3 seasons, it gets canceled by Fox but the show gets a second life elsewhere.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Season Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3691165977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA5ODBkOTgtMDc5Yi00YmI5LWI5MmMtOWE4ZGE0YmQwMjVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTA5ODBkOTgtMDc5Yi00YmI5LWI5MmMtOWE4ZGE0YmQwMjVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the trailer for the final season of \"The Mindy Project.\"", "uploadDate": "2017-09-01T16:28:29Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1411676/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mindy Kaling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2211129/characters/nm1411676?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mindy Lahiri"}, {"url": "#", "name": "117 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2819460/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ed Weeks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2211129/characters/nm2819460?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jeremy Reed"}, {"url": "#", "name": "115 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2837872/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Xosha Roquemore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2211129/characters/nm2837872?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tamra Webb"}, {"url": "#", "name": "82 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0054697/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ike Barinholtz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2211129/characters/nm0054697?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Morgan Tookers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0582149/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chris Messina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2211129/characters/nm0582149?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Danny Castellano"}, {"url": "#", "name": "89 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0335275/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Beth Grant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2211129/characters/nm0335275?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Beverly"}, {"url": "#", "name": "78 episodes, 2012-2017"}]}]}

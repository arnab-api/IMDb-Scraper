Even though the man hasn't really been able to prove a lot with his work as a director, I must say that I almost always appreciate him as an actor. He's perhaps not the most popular actor in Hollywood, but in my opinion he sure is one of the better ones.\n\nIn this movie he plays the role of Karl Childers, a grown, but simple man who is released from the psychiatric hospital where he has been hospitalized since the age of twelve. He had to stay in that hospital for so long because he murdered his own mother and her lover, believing that they were doing something wrong. He returns to the town where he lived the first twelve years of his life and it doesn't take long for him to get a job as a mechanic, fixing all kinds of small motors at a local repair shop. In the same town he also meets Frank, a young and friendly boy who immediately seems to like this strange man. Soon Karl is invited by Frank's mother to stay in their garage, much against the will of her alcoholic and abusive boyfriend Doyle. While Karl's friendship with Frank gets stronger, the tension between him and Doyle keeps building up, until reaching its final climax...\n\nNow that I've finally seen this movie, I can only say that it's too bad that I didn't give it a try earlier. Especially thanks to the magnificent performance by Billy Bob Thornton, this is a movie that is more than just worth a watch. But also the other actors like Dwight Yoakam, Natalie Canerday,... did a very good job. The entire movie feels very realistic, is quite sober and never tries to be too dramatic. This is the kind of movie that could have become very preachy, but it hasn't and that's something that I really appreciate. Add to this some good directing and you know that Thornton has done a very nice job with this movie.\n\nThis isn't exactly a typical Hollywood movie, not in its story and certainly not in its approach towards the subject. This could easily have become some kind of cheesy TV-movie, but Billy Bob Thornton has made a very good movie out of it instead. I really appreciated his work as a director, actor and writer in this movie, liked the story and was intrigued by the acting of all the actors. That's why I give it a 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H15M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sling Blade", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1573953049", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM2YjhjMjktYjYzOC00NWM0LTg3NTMtMGNlYTQ1YzlmNjRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM2YjhjMjktYjYzOC00NWM0LTg3NTMtMGNlYTQ1YzlmNjRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "HV", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:46:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000671/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Billy Bob Thornton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117666/characters/nm0000671?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Karl Childers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000687/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "J.T.

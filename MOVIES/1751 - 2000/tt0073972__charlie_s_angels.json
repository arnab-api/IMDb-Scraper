Okay, I could ignore the cheezy plots because in front of me each week were three beautiful young ladies working as private detectives.\n\nThe original girls were Farrah Fawcett-Majors as Jill Monroe, Kate Jackson as Sabrina Duncan and Jaclyn Smith as Kelly Garrett. They were my favourite line up in the show. Their bosses were John Bosley (played by the late David Doyle) and the faceless Charlie Townsend (voiced by John Forsythe).\n\nEach week the girls happened to go undercover on a case which required them to strip down in places such as health-spas and holiday camps. They used their seductive (and detective) skills to bring down the bad guys.\n\nIt was fun throughout even when the line-up changed and there were some really weird and surreal episodes at times. But who cares-when you've got three lovely women on the screen, great plots matter little."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Charlie's Angels", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2170534937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVhOTdkNGMtODc0NS00ZDIwLWI4MTUtNTVmMDEzNDhkMDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGVhOTdkNGMtODc0NS00ZDIwLWI4MTUtNTVmMDEzNDhkMDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2019-08-09T17:09:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000646/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jaclyn Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0073972/characters/nm0000646?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kelly Garrett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 1976-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001440/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Cheryl Ladd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0073972/characters/nm0001440?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kris Munroe"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 1977-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236329/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "David Doyle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0073972/characters/nm0236329?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Bosley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "110 episodes, 1976-1981"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000462/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kate Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0073972/characters/nm0000462?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sabrina Duncan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1976-1979"}]}]}

The man hours and intricate designs are something of an old school technique when compared to the latest computer wizardry, but you'll be amazed at what director Wes Anderson and his team managed to come up with, complete with a solid story, likable characters, and plenty of fun.\n\nGeorge Clooney voices Mr Fox, a smug (what else, since Clooney chews these type of roles for breakfast) and wily erm, fox whose specialty is being the chicken thief that he is, providing for family. An incident cutting too close to death has Mr Fox promise Mrs Fox (Meryl Streep) that his thieving days are over, but you know how a leopard cannot change its spots. Soon he moves his family near three farmers Bean (Michael Gambon), Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) and Bunce (Hugo Guinness), and crafts his final hurrah in hitting all three neighbours, only for them to retaliate and demolish Mr Fox's lifestyle, and not to mention his relationship with wife, family and friends, resulting in a battle of wills and wits.\n\nDespite the relatively short run time, the film managed to pack plenty of subplots, characterization, and comedy into one well oiled narrative. You'll surely be one without a sense of humour should you not be able to laugh at anything and everything that Anderson had put on screen, from slapstick to really smart and funny lines that make up every moment of enjoyment in this film. The A-list voice cast also includes the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Brian Cox, Adrien Brody et al, some of whom you'll know are regulars in Anderson's past works.\n\nAnd if you had enjoyed his past quirky films, then you'd come to expect the same for Fantastic Mr. Fox, with Wes Andersen's signature touches all over the shop, where he made some departures from Dahl's book, but manage to retain the essence of the story, and through a stroke of luck, finding an alternate ending from Dahl's original manuscript which got adopted here in the film. It's comical, it's smart, it's stop motion and it won't be too long before fans will soon adopt Mr Fox's trademarked whistle-whistle-click-click.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fantastic Mr. Fox -- Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3713925657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNDQ2NTQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMyNzYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNDQ2NTQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMyNzYyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Angry farmers, tired of sharing their chickens with a sly fox, look to get rid of their opponent and his family.", "uploadDate": "2009-10-09T12:32:10Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000123/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Clooney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0000123?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mr. Fox"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005403/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jason Schwartzman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0005403?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0938645/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Wallace Wolodarsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0938645?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Kylie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002091/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Michael Gambon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0002091?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Franklin Bean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005562/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Owen Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0005562?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Coach Skip"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0027572/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Wes Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0027572?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Weasel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3153953/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Robin Hurlstone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm3153953?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Walter Boggis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0567031/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Helen McCrory"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0567031?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Bean"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000658/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Meryl Streep"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0000658?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mrs. Fox"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000195/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bill Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0000195?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Badger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0026682/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Eric Chase Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0026682?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kristofferson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000353/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Willem Dafoe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0000353?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1006741/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Jarvis Cocker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm1006741?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Petey"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0240565/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Karen Duffy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm0240565?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Linda Otter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2450453/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Hugo Guinness"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0432283/characters/nm2450453?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nathan Bunce"}]}]}

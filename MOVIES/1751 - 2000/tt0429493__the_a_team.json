That being said, the expectations and sensitivities in a fan of the original series is non-existent in me, so this is purely based on what I felt about the movie itself.\n\nFirst off, the casting is near perfect. Everyone had a role that they played very well, and while Rampage Jackson's acting could have been a little better, his presence and screen time were downplayed to perhaps make up for it. But that's what I'm talking about, it was a very good balance of characters that was consistently carried throughout the movie. Who really stood out for me was Sharlto Copley. For someone who wasn't professionally trained as an actor, he portrayed the crazy Murdoch flawlessly. I brought my parents to watch the show and they loved his performance, with mom going as far to say the movie worked because everything funny came from him. I have to agree, I was certainly very entertained for the whole duration of the movie largely due to him.\n\nWhat I didn't particularly like were the computer generated effects. They looked quite fake at times, and it hints at a rushed job by animators. While the first three quarters of the film had a fairly consistent amount of action, the last quarter was overkill. Spoilt the movie a little for me, but the overall experience was a good one. Movies are meant to entertain and I most definitely was, much more than I expected for the price I paid for my ticket. Word of warning though - you really shouldn't think too deeply about the story when you're watching this. There are unresolved plot holes and some people have expressed upset at this, but the film was never marketed as a 'story' kind of film in any way so they really should've known better.\n\nThis movie is not for movie buffs who look for the meaning of life in films, but if a hilarious, well-acted, action-packed movie is your thing? I say go watch this now.\n\nStory : Okay \n\nActing : Ranging from awesome to not bad \n\nCast dynamics :Brilliant \n\nHilarity factor : Totally \n\nSpecial Effects : Acceptable to meh at times \n\nDuration : Long but I didn't feel it \n\nWould watch again : YEAH.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The A-Team: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1330381849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NzI4ODg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDEwNjczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NzI4ODg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDEwNjczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A group of Iraq War veterans looks to clear their name with the U.S. military, who suspect the four men of committing a crime for which they were framed.", "uploadDate": "2010-04-02T21:19:51Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000553/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Liam Neeson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0000553?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hannibal"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004754/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jessica Biel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0004754?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Charissa Sosa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1663205/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sharlto Copley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm1663205?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Murdock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0574468/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gerald McRaney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0574468?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "General Morrison"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0891485/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Yul Vazquez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0891485?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "General Javier Tuco"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0827561/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Maury Sterling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0827561?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Gammons"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1165044/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Omari Hardwick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm1165044?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Chopshop Jay"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2811073/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jacob Blair"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm2811073?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Agent Blair"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177896/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bradley Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0177896?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Face"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1961693/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm1961693?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "B.A. Baracus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0933940/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Patrick Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0933940?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lynch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001089/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Henry Czerny"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0001089?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Director McCready"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0089141/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Brian Bloom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0089141?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0155389/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Terry Chen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0155389?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ravech"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0400374/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "David Hugghins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0429493/characters/nm0400374?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Oskar Shunt"}]}]}

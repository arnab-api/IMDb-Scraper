The cinematography is breathtaking, and Riley Keough's performance is unbelievable. Like \"Mommy\" the central characters are two siblings who are up against some sort of unknown/unstable maternal presence while existing in isolation. Instead of a vast, lonely European farm, \"The Lodge\" features exactly what the title suggests -- a mountain lodge in the middle of nowhere. It's so well done that you can almost feel the icy frost in the theater as the film progresses.\n\nFranz & Fiala take a lot of cues from Ari Aster, ESPECIALLY \"Midsommar,\" in depicting sudden tragedy and brutal, existential grief that consistently drips off the screen. Additionally, there are underlying themes of mental illness and psychosis that are done really well and tactfully -- although I might add it may not seem so at first. Sorry if that's cryptic, I just don't want to give any spoilers. The ending will knock you on your ass. I couldn't move after the screening, I was frozen for half the credit roll, and couldn't stop thinking about it for days.\n\nI highly recommend \"The Lodge\" for fans of Aster's work, or if you liked \"Goodnight Mommy\" and want more of the same slow-burn insanity.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1885847321", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJlNmVmMTQtOGUwMy00NGEyLThiYjEtNDkzYjg3OWYzNTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJlNmVmMTQtOGUwMy00NGEyLThiYjEtNDkzYjg3OWYzNTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A soon-to-be stepmom is snowed in with her fianc\u00e9's two children at a remote holiday village.

Mostly it's about extremes of opinion, dreams and fantasies, dares, one-up-man-ship, and taking everything just a little bit further. And it's also entertaining - very entertaining, which is what television is meant to be, and so often is not. I'm not all that interested in cars, and my son doesn't even drive, but we both love the show, and watch it religiously.\n\nThe balance of presenters: Jeremy, the loud-mouthed, cuttingly funny, over-bearing older guy; Richard, the young, cute, quirky, adolescent one; James, the sensitive, quiet, contemplative, intelligent one; is nothing short of genius!\n\nIt seems that no expense is spared, either on the experiments and dares, or on filming, and this adds to the visual experience. This show is funny, even hilarious at times, classy, controversial, and hugely entertaining. Most people I know who watch this show know almost less than nothing about cars, and I think that says a lot about how successfully this program reaches beyond the expected demographic of young male petrol-heads.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 27 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3437214745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5M2I2MTItYjY2Mi00NjNjLWI5YTktNDc4MzZhYjk0N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5M2I2MTItYjY2Mi00NjNjLWI5YTktNDc4MzZhYjk0N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 27 of \"Top Gear\" premieres this summer with hosts Paddy McGuinness, Freddie Flintoff and Chris Harris.", "uploadDate": "2019-05-28T21:18:22Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1414369/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Hammond"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1628033/characters/nm1414369?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Self - Presenter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "230 episodes, 2002-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561982/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James May"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1628033/characters/nm0561982?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Self - Presenter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "219 episodes, 2003-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0165087/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeremy Clarkson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1628033/characters/nm0165087?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Self - Presenter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "229 episodes, 2002-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5103457/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "The Stig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1628033/characters/nm5103457?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Self - Presenter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "145 episodes, 2004-2020"}]}]}

I hear reviews saying this film \"sucks\" or it has too many inaccuracies. Movies like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List have also \"some\" inaccuracies in them. (They are Masterpieces) It is pretty sad this film has been getting this bashed. It doesn't deserve to be.\n\nThe Hurt Locker is full of suspense and is directed beautifully by Kathryn Bigelow. I'd have to say this is movie truly captures the Iraq War. What a dangerous war it was for our soldiers. This movie shows us what our soldiers went through. This isn't bashing the American soldiers at all or even War. It gives us a great deal of appreciation for our troops who are risking their lives every single day for Us, Freedom and the U.S.A.\n\nThe true purpose of this movie is to not just praise the soldiers. But for one of the military's unrecognized heroes which are the technicians of the bombs squads who risk their lives to save others. This is the purpose of the movie to let everyone know what these people do.\n\nThis time and I know all of you out there, don't want to hear it, the critics are actually right. This movie is fantastically directed by Kathryn Bigelow and she rightfully deserved her Oscar for best director.\n\nI know many Avatar fans out there probably rated this movie a 1, without even seeing it because it won Best Picture and Avatar didn't. This movie seems its suffering from the curse of Best Picture. More people have watched Avatar than the Hurt Locker. So of course this film has gotten bashed by so many. I think SOME of the bad reviews are the Avatar Fanboys who are just angry Avatar didn't win Best Picture.\n\nPlease don't just go along with the bad reviews this film has gotten from IMDb. Just try and watch this film.\n\nThe Hurt Locker is a war epic, that I hope it becomes appreciative as time passes. 9/10 Highly recommended.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H11M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Hurt Locker", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2755855129", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyODYzODQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4Mzg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyODYzODQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4Mzg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In Baghdad, members of a bomb-disposal team near the end of their rotation deadline are pulled into a deadly game of urban combat by a new sergeant (Renner).", "uploadDate": "2009-04-17T08:15:07Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0719637/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jeremy Renner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm0719637?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Staff Sergeant William James"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1310016/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Brian Geraghty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm1310016?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Specialist Owen Eldridge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000146/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ralph Fiennes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm0000146?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Contractor Team Leader"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1431940/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Evangeline Lilly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm1431940?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Connie James"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2778904/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Suhail Dabbach"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm2778904?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Black Suit Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3443737/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nabil Koni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm3443737?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Professor Nabil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0714866/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sam Redford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm0714866?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Contractor Jimmy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3442056/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Barrie Rice"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm3442056?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Contractor Chris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1107001/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Anthony Mackie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm1107001?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sergeant JT Sanborn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001602/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Guy Pearce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm0001602?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sergeant Matt Thompson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001556/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "David Morse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm0001556?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Colonel Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0131235/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Christian Camargo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm0131235?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Colonel John Cambridge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3441508/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Christopher Sayegh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm3441508?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Beckham"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0819874/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sam Spruell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm0819874?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Contractor Charlie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3443699/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Feisal Sadoun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0887912/characters/nm3443699?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Contractor Feisal"}]}]}

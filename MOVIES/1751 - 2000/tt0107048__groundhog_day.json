He has one of those faces, and a voice to go with it, which can make nastiness and sarcasm funny. Groundhog Day is a highly enjoyable vehicle for Murray's talents. It also has a very clever concept, neatly brought to the screen by actor-turned-director Harold Ramis (who starred alongside Murray in the Ghostbusters films).\n\nPittsburgh weather-man Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent on assignment to Punxatawney, where on Groundhog Day each year the locals have a tradition of consulting the groundhog to find out if spring is imminent or if they should prepare for 6 more weeks of winter. Phil despises the job and the town, and can't wait to get it over with.... even though he has a soft spot for Rita (Andie MacDowell), the producer overseeing his broadcast. Phil's dislike of Punxatawney, its people and its traditions is set to get a hell of a lot worse though.... as when he awakens the next morning he finds himself reliving the same day. And so it goes - every time Phil gets up, it's still February 2nd and he seems destined to be stuck in the same day for the rest of eternity.\n\nIt seems early on in the proceedings that the film might run out of steam and inspiration. After all, how can a film about a day which repeats itself be anything but repetitive? Thankfully, Groundhog Day is full of ingenious ideas, and it successfully throws up new developments and delightful twists at every opportunity. The film is laced with memorable dialogue, and Murray gets to play one of the defining roles of his career as a facetious, sharp-tongued misanthrope who ultimately learns the error of his ways. Groundhog Day is a very good film indeed, and restores one's faith in the imagination still lurking beneath the dismayingly shallow surface of Hollywood.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Groundhog Day", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1957600025", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVmMDg4NjAtZmZiYi00ZjkwLTlmZWItZjM4NGQ1MDgxOGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVmMDg4NjAtZmZiYi00ZjkwLTlmZWItZjM4NGQ1MDgxOGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Groundhog Day", "uploadDate": "2010-12-31T06:16:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000195/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bill Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0000195?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Phil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0254402/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chris Elliott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0254402?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Larry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0236519/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brian Doyle-Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0236519?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Buster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0665708/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Angela Paton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0665708?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mrs. Lancaster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0653959/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rick Overton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0653959?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ralph"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0084627/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Carol Bivins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0084627?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Anchorwoman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0132637/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ken Hudson Campbell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0132637?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Man in Hallway"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0783263/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rod Sell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0783263?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Groundhog Official"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000510/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Andie MacDowell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0000510?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Rita"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0864997/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Stephen Tobolowsky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0864997?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ned"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0313882/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marita Geraghty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0313882?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Nancy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0239958/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Rick Ducommun"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0239958?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Gus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0241208/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Robin Duke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0241208?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Doris the Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0308606/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Willie Garson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0308606?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Phil's Assistant Kenny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0687971/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Les Podewell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0107048/characters/nm0687971?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Old Man"}]}]}

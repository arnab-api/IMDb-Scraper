I really enjoyed it, I like the modern reboot of this classic story. I like the way they have taken the era in which the original Washington Irving story takes place, which gives a nod to the man and story itself and skillfully brings it into the modern day. \n\nSleepy Hollow blends in elements of magic, horror and mystery. The production values are great, the casting and acting also spot on and I love the creative license they have taken with the story. It's crazy, fun and full of surprises. One of which I really like, is the apocalyptic angle. I also really like the supernatural aspect of it, I'd love to go into more detail, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't watched it yet. \n\nI'm glad to see the networks finally embracing genres like horror -\"The Walking Dead\" is a great example of how, if done well, and taken seriously, a genre TV show can be a big hit with a large demographic. I'm certain I'm not alone in being over the so called \"reality TV\" which is neither reality nor proper TV. I'm also sick and tired of the endless cop procedural's that seem to dominate network TV. It's time for new ideas, even if they come from old stories. \n\nIf they keep up the good writing, develop the characters properly, keep high production values and hold onto the show runner for more than one season without replacing them, I can easily see this show be a success.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Promo", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1578871065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNTEyMDQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY0NzMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNTEyMDQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY0NzMyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch a trailer from the upcoming Fox series \"Sleepy Hollow\".", "uploadDate": "2013-08-24T08:51:18Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2070427/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Mison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2647544/characters/nm2070427?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ichabod Crane"}, {"url": "#", "name": "62 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2718512/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nicole Beharie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2647544/characters/nm2718512?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Abbie Mills"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2316016/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Katia Winter"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2647544/characters/nm2316016?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Katrina Crane"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3442405/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lyndie Greenwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2647544/characters/nm3442405?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jenny Mills"}, {"url": "#", "name": "57 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0428963/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Orlando Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2647544/characters/nm0428963?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Frank Irving"}, {"url": "#", "name": "31 episodes, 2013-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0633604/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "John Noble"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2647544/characters/nm0633604?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Henry Parrish"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2013-2017"}]}]}

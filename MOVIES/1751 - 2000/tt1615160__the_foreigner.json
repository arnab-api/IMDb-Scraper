Chan, now 63 years old, seems to be doing most of his own stunts and age hasn't slowed him much at all.\u00a0 It was great fun to see him jumping around, beating up the bad guys and flying down drainpipes and over vehicles.\u00a0 Jackie still has it.\n\nSince Chan is silent and dour, the lion's share of the emotion, plotting and energy of this film falls to the chief antagonist - Pierce Brosnan's Liam Hennessy - who just might know more than he is letting on about the bombing.\u00a0 Brosnan has aged gracefully, post-James Bond, and he continues to surprise me with the depth of his performances.\u00a0 He makes a good adversary to Chan.\n\nAlso making a comeback, of sorts, is Director Martin Campbell - who Directed Daniel Craig as James Bond in CASINO\u00a0ROYALE and Brosnan himself\u00a0 as Bond in GOLDENEYE.\u00a0 Campbell hasn't directed a Major Motion Picture since the 2011 flop, THE GREEN LANTERN.\u00a0 It is good to see the practiced eye and steady hand of a veteran Director at the helm.\n\nBe warned - this film is not all action - Campbell spends much of his time on the political maneuvering of Brosnan with Chan jumping in (literally) to spoil plans time and again, so be ready for that type of film, not a RUSH HOUR fun romp.\u00a0 If you do, you'll be rewarded, indeed.\n\nLetter Grade A-\n\n8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1332787481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NhMGVkMDEtNjNmMC00NTMyLTk4ZGMtMDk1ODg3ZTVlYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NhMGVkMDEtNjNmMC00NTMyLTk4ZGMtMDk1ODg3ZTVlYjljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A humble businessman with a buried past seeks justice when his daughter is killed in an act of terrorism.

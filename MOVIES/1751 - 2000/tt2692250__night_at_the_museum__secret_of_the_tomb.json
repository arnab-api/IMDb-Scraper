Night at the Museum can be everything an audience wants from a family film for the whole brood. Secret of the Tomb delivers adequately in the way a third film should, with heart, care and laughter.\n\nLarry the night guard is still living the dream caring for the exhibits, and familiar characters, that come alive at night at the Museum of Natural History, thanks to the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. But magic is a fickle thing, and the Tablet is deteriorating, causing mayhem, havoc and danger to his pals at the museum. Motivated to save his friends, he ventures on a quest to discover more about the Tablet which brings him to the Museum of London as a last ditch effort to restore the Tablet and preserve his waxy, plastic and ancient companions.\n\nWith its third and final installment, director Shawn Levy returns to the magic that existed in the original Night at the Museum which ultimately captivated film-goers. As with many sequels, the third installment stays true to the premise of its predecessors and only slightly freshens up the premise with a couple of new characters and a swift change of location. Screenwriters David Guion and Michael Handelman smartly bring back beloved characters from the first film and don't muddy up the premise or story too much with over-complications.\n\nFans of the franchise will be pleasantly surprised by the heartfelt and sentimental Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb. The thoughtfulness and homages to ancient history are present and the jokes have a wide enough range to make any age giggle. Rebel Wilson might be the one drawback for some viewers, as her distinctly loud character is weird and obnoxious and detracts from the sweet film.\n\nFilm watchers be warned, you might shed many tears by the end of this film, as this film critic did. The poignancy and relevancy of the film's final scenes are nearly too much as this film touches your soul and makes you nostalgic for the wonder that is Robin Williams.\n\nPlease check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4060720921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Larry leaves New York City for London, where he unites favorite and new characters while embarking on a quest to save the magic before it is gone forever.", "uploadDate": "2014-11-14T07:56:06Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001774/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ben Stiller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0001774?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Larry Daley"}, {"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0001774?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Laaa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005562/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Owen Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0005562?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jedediah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0315041/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ricky Gervais"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0315041?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dr. McPhee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2313103/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rebel Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm2313103?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Tilly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1785339/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rami Malek"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm1785339?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ahkmenrah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0669693/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Mizuo Peck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0669693?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sacajawea"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2640714/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Crystal the Monkey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm2640714?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dexter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001682/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mickey Rooney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0001682?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gus"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000245/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Robin Williams"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0000245?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Teddy Roosevelt"}, {"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0000245?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Voice of Garuda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176869/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Steve Coogan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0176869?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Octavius"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1405398/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dan Stevens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm1405398?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sir Lancelot"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1711114/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Skyler Gisondo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm1711114?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Nick Daley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0302466/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Patrick Gallagher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0302466?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Attila"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001426/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ben Kingsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0001426?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Merenkahre (Ahk's Father)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001813/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Dick Van Dyke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2692250/characters/nm0001813?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Cecil"}]}]}

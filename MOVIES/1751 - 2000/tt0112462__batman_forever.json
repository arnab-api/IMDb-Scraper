It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.\n\nNicole Kidman is perfectly cast as Chase Meridian and I like Chris O'Donnell as Robin even though he was probably a tad old. Everyone criticizes Val Kilmer for being too bland compared to Keaton but honestly the latter wouldn't have worked at all in the film the way it was done. Since Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are both such strong personalities a more stoic Kilmer contrasts that well. Batman Forever really is Jim Carrey's vehicle though. You watch Batman Forever for Jim Carrey the same way you watch Batman 1989 for Jack Nicholson.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1146535449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgwYzBkNDYtMjkzYy00MDk2LWFhN2MtN2M0NDQxNmQ5ZGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgwYzBkNDYtMjkzYy00MDk2LWFhN2MtN2M0NDQxNmQ5ZGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Batman must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face and Edward Nygma, The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin.", "uploadDate": "2020-08-12T14:12:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000174/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Val Kilmer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000174?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Batman"}, {"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000174?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bruce Wayne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000120/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jim Carrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000120?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Riddler"}, {"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000120?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edward Nygma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000563/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chris O'Donnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000563?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Robin"}, {"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000563?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dick Grayson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0385757/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pat Hingle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0385757?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Commissioner Gordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000529/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Debi Mazar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000529?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Spice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0041281/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rene Auberjonois"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0041281?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dr. Burton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0600657/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Philip Moon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0600657?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Male Newscaster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0657315/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dennis Paladino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0657315?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Crime Boss Moroni"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000169/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tommy Lee Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000169?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Harvey Two-Face"}, {"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000169?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Harvey Dent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000173/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nicole Kidman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000173?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Chase Meridian"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001284/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Gough"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0001284?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alfred Pennyworth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000106/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Drew Barrymore"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0000106?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sugar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0761545/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Elizabeth Sanders"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0761545?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Gossip Gerty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0341055/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Joe Grifasi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0341055?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Bank Guard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0875768/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jessica Tuck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112462/characters/nm0875768?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Female Newscaster"}]}]}

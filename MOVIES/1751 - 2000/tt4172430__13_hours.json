The attack is a part of history that deserves to be put on screen in as grand and well produced manner as can be. And in that sense it succeeds. The filming in Morocco and Malta captures a really on location feel. \n\nThe battles are well done and engaging, not over the top. It was a bit confusing at times distinguishing the main characters. Maybe they shouldn't have had beards for the movie because it made them look alike. Jon Krasinski and James Badge Dale, Max Martini and Dominic Fumusa are all good as the heroes. There is just enough background with kids and wives shown to put a human element to the people. Whatever your politics is, they were brave. Liked Jon Krasinki's characters statement about dying over there at the end.\n\nThe journey under fire from the embassy to the annex was gripping. The prolonged gunfire and mortar attack on the annex was quite scary too. It was chaotic but as long as you kept the 2 compounds separate in your mind it was okay. Initially, a little bit less back and forth between scenarios would have been better. \n\nThere are the \"bad\" good guys - the incompetent CIA people especially the chief who gives the infamous and disputed \"Stand down\" order. Wish they had shown a bit more of the Ambassador's death and recovery of his body but maybe it was just too disheartening for the screen. \n\nSome people against the movie are probably just unhappy it was made in the first place. Apart from the stand down and request for air support it isn't too directly critical of the administration. There might not be a way to make a movie about Benghazi that actually could make the haters happy. \n\nWatch this movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H24M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi481015065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2OTI0MTQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIxNjg2NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2OTI0MTQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIxNjg2NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An American Ambassador is killed during an attack at a U.S. compound in Libya as a security team struggles to make sense out of the chaos.", "uploadDate": "2016-01-12T13:54:44Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1024677/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "John Krasinski"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm1024677?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack Silva"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1032567/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Pablo Schreiber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm1032567?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kris 'Tanto' Paronto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1047883/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Dominic Fumusa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm1047883?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John 'Tig' Tiegen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1715145/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alexia Barlier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm1715145?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Sona Jillani"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1818216/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Payman Maadi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm1818216?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Amahl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0827170/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Toby Stephens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm0827170?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Glen 'Bub' Doherty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1365912/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Giuntoli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm1365912?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "DS Scott Wickland"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2412970/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "David Furr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm2412970?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "DS Alec"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0197647/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "James Badge Dale"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm0197647?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tyrone 'Rone' Woods"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0219292/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "David Denman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm0219292?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dave 'Boon' Benton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242882/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Max Martini"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm0242882?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mark 'Oz' Geist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0182345/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Costabile"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm0182345?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0504762/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Matt Letscher"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm0504762?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ambassador Chris Stevens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2009006/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Demetrius Grosse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm2009006?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "DS Dave Ubben"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6591687/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Kevin Kent"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt4172430/characters/nm6591687?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "DS Vincent"}]}]}

I was eight, the year she is in the prolouge. Ever since, I have been interested in the story of Anastasia Nikolaevna Romanov, her life, and her untimely death.\n\nWhile I know the movie is not historically accurate, I don't care! The movie is fiction after all- based on a true story (of Anastasia's rumored escape and women who claimed to be her), loosely, mind you- but perhaps it is not as unlikely as it seems: when the remains of the Romanovs were discovered back in 1991, Alexei (her brother,the Czarvitch) and one of the Grand Duchesses were missing. And with age analysis of the bones, scientists believe that the missing daughter is in fact Anastasia, and not one of her sisters, Olga, Tatiana, or Maria. But who really knows what happened?\n\nMy opinion of the movie is that it is wonderful. It draws you into the world of the lost Russian Princess, to a time that is \"far away, long ago\", that doesn't exist anymore.\n\nThe music and animation are stunning, and the photo research of St. Petersburg is amazing! Take the Catherine Palace and the magnificent gate you see, as well as the city itself. The 3-D animation is amazing; you look like you could reach out and touch it! The music is truly magical; \"Once Upon a December\" (especially Deana Carter's version)\n\nis haunting yet beautiful. I own the soundtrack- I listen to it frequently\n\nto help me relax.\n\nBut what I love best about the movie is the romance that occurs between Anya(Anastasia) and Dimitri. It starts out as a con, a trick for money, and turns into a love story. I think it shows that people really do have good in them, and that true love really exists. It's also heartwarming to think that a young boy who saved the girl he liked (princess or not) later helps her restore her identity and find a true place (in this case, happily together with him).\n\n\"Anastasia\" is really my favourite movie of all time, even though now I'm almost 15. I'd recommend it to anyone, and advise historical literialists to look beyond the fiction and let yourself be taken on a \"Journey to the Past\" with the romance, comedy, and magic of this story."}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi257277721", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYxN2MzYTMtNDEzMS00N2VmLWEyNmUtYjIxMDkwY2YwYmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYxN2MzYTMtNDEzMS00N2VmLWEyNmUtYjIxMDkwY2YwYmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-01-31T15:22:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000212/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Meg Ryan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0000212?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Anastasia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001288/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kelsey Grammer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0001288?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Vladimir"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000279/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hank Azaria"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0000279?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Bartok"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000379/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kirsten Dunst"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0000379?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Young Anastasia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429115/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rick Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0429115?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Czar Nicholas"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0429115?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Servant"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0429115?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Revolutionary Soldier"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0429115?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Ticket Agent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0364385/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Glenn Walker Harris Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0364385?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Young Dimitri"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0539395/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Arthur Malet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0539395?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Travelling Man"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0539395?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Major Domo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0130356/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Liz Callaway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0130356?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Anastasia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000131/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Cusack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0000131?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dimitri"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000502/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Christopher Lloyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0000502?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rasputin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001613/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bernadette Peters"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0001613?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sophie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001450/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Angela Lansbury"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0001450?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "The Dowager Empress Marie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0551908/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Andrea Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0551908?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Phlegmenkoff"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0551908?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Old Woman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0600717/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Debra Mooney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0600717?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Actress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0416349/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Charity James"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118617/characters/nm0416349?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Anastasia Impostor"}]}]}

You used to know that.\"\n\nFirst, a warning. The American is an atypical spy-thriller. If you're wanting to check out an adrenaline-fueled action film, you should check out Salt. The American is a slow- burner, and more of a character study than anything else.\u00a0\n\nThe main character Jack is an assassin and weapons maker who at his heart, is a lonely man. His last engagement was marred by an incident where he had to kill the woman he was involved with, and he's forced to move on to a small town in Italy where he's given another assignment and told to wait. But he finds himself drawn again to another woman, and that complication may turn his employer against him.\n\nClooney gives a great understated performance as the quiet, complex Jack, and he's joined by a pair of excellent, beautiful female leads in Violante Placido and Thekla Reuten. Their beauty is matched by the beauty of the small Italian towns and countryside where the majority of the movie takes place. The sedate pace of the film gives you time to absorb the mood of the setting, as well as understand the effect it has on Jack.\u00a0\n\nThe American will definitely not appeal to everyone. There are two or three effective action scenes, but at no point is that kind of thing the focus of the movie. Imagine the tone of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and you won't be far off the mark.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The American: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi447940121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MTQzNzM0MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYwNzU2MzMx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA1MTQzNzM0MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYwNzU2MzMx._V1_.jpg", "description": "An assassin hiding out in an Italian village while he anticipates his last-ever assignment tempts fate by seeking out the friendship of a priest (Bonacelli) as well as the affection of a local woman (Placido).", "uploadDate": "2010-06-18T08:16:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000123/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "George Clooney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0000123?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jack"}, {"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0000123?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Edward"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0387073/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lars Hjelm"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0387073?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hunter #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0508085/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Johan Leysen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0508085?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Pavel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0299993/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Giorgio Gobbi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0299993?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Man on Vespa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0720671/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Thekla Reuten"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0720671?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mathilde"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1576916/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Samuel Vauramo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm1576916?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Young Swedish Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686376/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Violante Placido"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0686376?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Clara"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186207/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Ilaria Cramerotti"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0186207?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hooker #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0084950/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Irina Bj\u00f6rklund"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0084950?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ingrid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0334689/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Bj\u00f6rn Granath"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0334689?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Hunter #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0093678/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paolo Bonacelli"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0093678?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Father Benedetto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0097950/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Silvana Bosi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0097950?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Old Cheese Vendor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1478755/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Guido Palliggiano"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm1478755?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Waiter (Market)"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3287747/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Antonio Rampino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm3287747?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Postmaster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0863599/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Filippo Timi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1440728/characters/nm0863599?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Fabio"}]}]}

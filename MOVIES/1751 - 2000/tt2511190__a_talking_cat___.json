Why? Well, the movie's synopsis didn't really sell the movie all that well, and it seemed to be a questionable movie at best, and truth be told, having Eric Roberts as the voice of the talking cat wasn't really selling the movie.\n\nBut still, as I hadn't already seen the movie, I sat down to watch the 2013 movie from writer Andrew Helm and director David DeCoteau (credited as Mary Crawford!).\n\nAnd this movie was bad alright, mark my words.\n\nFirst of all, the storyline seemed like something that was written by a middle school student for a class act to be performed in front of an auditorium full of hopeful parents. Yeah, the storyline wasn't exactly riveting, nor particularly entertaining.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, the cat shown on the movie's cover wasn't even the cat that was in the movie. The cat on the movie's cover/poster is an adorable and cute kitten, while the cat in the actual movie was more of a chunky adult cat - still cute though, as it is a cat. And to top it all off, Eric Roberts delivered the lines for Duffy the cat with as much gusto and enthusiasm as an inmate on Death Row. I was imagining Eric Roberts at the microphone with a 12 pack of beer in one hand and the script in the other. For all the people that they could have picked from, they chose that guy?\n\nWell, the horror doesn't end there. And by that I mean the atrociously bad animated mouth they put on the cat when it delivered Eric Roberts' flat and monotonous dialogue. It was so fake and seemed like something taken out of a \"South Park\" episode. It was horrible to witness and such an eyesore.\n\n\"A Talking Cat!?!\" is a movie that you shouldn't bother spending your time or effort on. Some of us suffered through the ordeal so you don't have to. Believe you me.\n\nMy rating of this 2013 abysmal movie settles on a generous two out of ten stars.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "2"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2760949785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE3NjkzYzItODRmZC00YWQyLWFlMTUtMjA2ZDVhNmJlZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE3NjkzYzItODRmZC00YWQyLWFlMTUtMjA2ZDVhNmJlZjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2021-03-15T23:38:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0924278/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Johnny Whitaker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2511190/characters/nm0924278?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Phil"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4009603/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Justin Cone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2511190/characters/nm4009603?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3187025/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alison Sieke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2511190/characters/nm3187025?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Frannie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000616/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Eric Roberts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2511190/characters/nm0000616?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Duffy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0213374/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kristine DeBell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2511190/characters/nm0213374?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Susan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5284988/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Janis Valdez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2511190/characters/nm5284988?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5409267/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Daniel Dannas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2511190/characters/nm5409267?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Trent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11685779/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Squeaky"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2511190/characters/nm11685779?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Duffy"}]}]}

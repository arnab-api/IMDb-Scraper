Capote who wanted Marilyn Monroe cast as Holly Golightly lived to see Audrey Hepburn make his literary creation one of her best cinematic creations. I think given Marilyn's track record for behavioral problems on film sets, Capote, Blake Edwards the director, and everyone else concerned with Breakfast At Tiffany's probably dodged a bullet. \n\nCapote's story is set in the Forties and the film is contemporary 1961 when it was filmed. There's no real plot to it, Capote did a character study and so is this. It's about two people and the fascination that George Peppard's character develops for the unconventionality of Holly Golightly as Hepburn essays her.\n\nHepburn is the kept woman of a cross section of the male species and Peppard is the boy toy of another woman who rents in their apartment, Patricia Neal. Neal who would win her Oscar the following year for Hud has her character as curiously underdeveloped. It's the main weakness of Breakfast At Tiffany's.\n\nThe strength is of course Audrey Hepburn who took Capote's character completely over and it's her vision of the story that we see when the film is broadcast. She's an amoral minx who in the end realizes that her life is really meaningless. \n\nBreakfast At Tiffany's won two Oscars both for Henry Mancini for Best Musical Scoring and Best Original Song for Moon River. That song is best known for Andy Williams's rendition, but there are also superb recordings by Frank Sinatra and Tony Martin. Hepburn got a nomination for Best Actress and the film was also nominated for Best Art&Set Decoration for a color film and Best Screenplay adapted from another medium, in this case Capote's novella. \n\nConsidering all the changes made, maybe the credit should have read inspired by Truman Capote's work. In any event this film belongs in the top rank of the works of Audrey Hepburn.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Breakfast at Tiffany's: Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi786734361", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc2NzY0NTQ3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE0NzM4NA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc2NzY0NTQ3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE0NzM4NA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the original trailer for Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard.", "uploadDate": "2011-03-31T13:02:14Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000030/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Audrey Hepburn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054698/characters/nm0000030?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Holly Golightly"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0623658/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Patricia Neal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054698/characters/nm0623658?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "2E Failenson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000842/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Martin Balsam"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0054698/characters/nm0000842?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "O.J.

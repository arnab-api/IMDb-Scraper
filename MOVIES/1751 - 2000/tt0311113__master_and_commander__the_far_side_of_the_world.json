You'll know why five minutes in.\n\nI didn't want to leave the theater when this roller coaster rhapsody to sea soldiery circa 1805 was over. It's stirring entertainment. No love interests needed. This was what it was really like. One ship, 197 men, 4500 miles from home. Chasing a French ship twice her size. No retreat.\n\n Pirates of the Crappy Be-in was a cute romp, but Master and Commander has real ships, real crews, real cannon,convincing characters, historical accuracy and a REAL film director.\n\nDirector/ Peter Weir (Witness) has returned big time and, with this one film, revived classic Australian realism, actually surpassing the production values of Peter Jackson's Ring Trilogy. This is not a fantasy film, but history - painstakingly recreated. And rousing history it is, with plenty of action AND robust character development. The adaptation by Weir and John Colley is right on target, brimming with great characters and scenes.\n\n And Russel Crowe? Other than \"The Insider\", this is his best role ever. Gladiator was just a warm-up. A Beautiful Mind? Well, nice acting from the neck up. Go see this if you want to see both his athleticism and his formidable acting chops! And he decent musical gifts as well (RC studied violin for the role).\n\nI've always thought Weir was one of our great directors. Now he's been given all the toys Peter Jackson enjoys. And Weir uses them to great effect - recreating a nautical reality that lacks nothing except the need to wipe your face every ten seconds. The cutting of Russel Boyd's fabulous photography is perfect. You get to know every inch of the ship, topside and down below. You also get a strong sense of the social dynamics on board - how men got along with each other for so many months. I felt swept along in a perfect mix of virile action and characters I could get to know and care for. One thing I loved was the constant caring between many of the men along the rank and file. There's a strong sense of honor and decency in the film. Yet enough grog flows to keep things loose.\n\nThis is vigorous stuff and my most thrilling two hours in a theater for a while. Congratulations to everyone involved.\n\nFor now, the best director Oscar goes to Peter Weir over Clint Eastwood (Mystic River)in 2004. Master and Commander is my pick for best picture, just because it is so masterfully realized. A stunning, exhilarating, and - at last - realistic action saga."}, "duration": "PT2H18M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3029664025", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY4OTVkN2EtYjBlYi00Zjk2LTlmNDYtMGQ2YzI4ZTgwYzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY4OTVkN2EtYjBlYi00Zjk2LTlmNDYtMGQ2YzI4ZTgwYzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Miramax", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:58:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000128/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Russell Crowe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0311113/characters/nm0000128?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Capt.

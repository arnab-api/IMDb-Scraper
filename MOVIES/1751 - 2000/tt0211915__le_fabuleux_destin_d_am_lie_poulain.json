Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to \"normal\" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life. \n\n\"You mean she would rather imagine herself relating to an absent person than build relationships with those around her?\"\n\nHmm, so would I sometimes. Audrey Tautou's been a more reliable friend than most people and has put a smile on my face and lightened my day at the thought of her more times than one. And I still say I'll marry her one day.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bande-annonce [OV]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1406515737", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc2ODQwNTEtNjk1ZS00Y2MwLTk4OWQtZWQ1OGYxYjI0MmM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc2ODQwNTEtNjk1ZS00Y2MwLTk4OWQtZWQ1OGYxYjI0MmM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-11-29T16:47:47Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0851582/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Audrey Tautou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0851582?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Am\u00e9lie Poulain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0749363/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rufus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0749363?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rapha\u00ebl Poulain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0581014/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Serge Merlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0581014?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Raymond Dufayel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597042/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Clotilde Mollet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0597042?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0620964/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Isabelle Nanty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0620964?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Georgette"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0671844/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Artus de Penguern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0671844?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hipolito"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0133636/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Urbain Cancelier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0133636?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Collignon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0732220/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michel Robin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0732220?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mr. Collignon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0440913/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mathieu Kassovitz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0440913?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Nino Quincampoix"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186677/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lorella Cravotta"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0186677?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Amandine Poulain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0213354/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Jamel Debbouze"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0213354?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lucien"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0561158/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Claire Maurier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0561158?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Madame Suzanne - la patronne du caf\u00e9"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0684500/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dominique Pinon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0684500?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Joseph"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0603446/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Yolande Moreau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0603446?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Madeleine Wallace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0126870/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Maurice B\u00e9nichou"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0211915/characters/nm0126870?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Dominique Bretodeau"}]}]}

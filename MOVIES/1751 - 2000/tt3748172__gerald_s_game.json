There's the presence of raw indecency and rotten attachments right beside the gore, and this movie is very good at portraying that.\n\nI started watching this movie expecting to get bored at some point, because Gerald's Game is an odd pick of a novel to make into a film. A lot of the story revolves around the heroine spending hours alone and restricted. In a book, the writer has the freedom to play around with memories and weave them into the present, but was the director going to be able to do that?\n\nThe answer is, yes, he is, and he does that very well. Kudos to a thoroughly entertaining experience, whether it was the 80's gore effects, the commendable acting of Mr. and Mrs. Gerald, or the shifts from almost comedic to certainly nauseating scenes. \n\nThe only thing that bothered me was that the cinematography was a bit dated, and nothing creative. But it doesn't mean that this movie is not worth the watch, and it will be even more enjoyable if you haven't read the book!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3305617689", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWFjMThmMWMtNGE5NC00ZjJkLWE2MWItY2NiOTViYzZlMjhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWFjMThmMWMtNGE5NC00ZjJkLWE2MWItY2NiOTViYzZlMjhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "While trying to spice up her marriage in a remote lake house, a woman must suddenly fight to survive when she is left handcuffed to a bed.", "uploadDate": "2017-09-06T16:42:37Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001303/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Carla Gugino"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm0001303?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jessie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5988570/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chiara Aurelia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm5988570?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Young Jessie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001794/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Henry Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm0001794?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9309212/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Adalyn Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm9309212?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Maddie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597297/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Gwendolyn Mulamba"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm0597297?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Judge"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1938459/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dori Lumpkin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm1938459?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Teenage Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5269775/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nikia Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm5269775?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Reporter #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0096119/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Chuck Borden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm0096119?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Court Officer #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0339304/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bruce Greenwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm0339304?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Gerald"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0835393/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carel Struycken"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm0835393?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Moonlight Man"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2318089/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Kate Siegel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm2318089?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sally"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm9040109/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bryce Harper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm9040109?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1530627/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "James Flanagan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm1530627?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Court Clerk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1092778/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Natalie Roers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm1092778?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Reporter #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5047132/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Bill Riales"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3748172/characters/nm5047132?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Reporter #3"}]}]}

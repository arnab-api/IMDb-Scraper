They were fun and with the exception of Dallas, the three others all had one thing in common.  They all solved things with very little violence.  Even though it may seem that there was some, The A Team always made contraptions that would get them out of trouble, but no one died.  The Dukes always fought their way out of trouble just long enough for Roscoe to come arrest the bad guys and with Mac, well he would just make a radio receiver out of a paperclip grass and a shoelace or he would make a dart gun out of bubble gum and toothpick.  I honeslty believe that this this was the toughest man in the world.  Put him up against the Terminator and he would have found a way to dismantle his CPU without ever touching it.  He would make something to shut him down.  And that's what was so pure about MacGyver.  He never really used violence to solve problems, always his head.  And he never got carried away either.  He never panicked.  He just stayed cool and he always managed to save the day. I love this show and I wish they would bring it back, even in sydication where I am, but we don't have it here and that is a shame because it is a great show and one that I miss."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "MacGyver: Blue-Ray", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2062662169", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwYTY5YWUtODNmOC00ZTAxLThhMjctMmNhZWYxNjQyZmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwYTY5YWUtODNmOC00ZTAxLThhMjctMmNhZWYxNjQyZmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Blue-Ray", "uploadDate": "2018-11-03T17:10:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000760/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Dean Anderson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088559/characters/nm0000760?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "MacGyver"}, {"url": "#", "name": "139 episodes, 1985-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0253020/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dana Elcar"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0088559/characters/nm0253020?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Pete Thornton"}, {"url": "#", "name": "126 episodes, 1985-1992"}]}]}

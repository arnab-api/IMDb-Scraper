The film is brilliant!", "reviewBody": "I think if someone tries to watch a Wes Anderson film, they have to have a certain kind mind to understand the real meaning of them. After being awed by the Royal Tenenbaums, I left with a certain kind of joy that only a great film can give me. It's like flying an electric kite, it's that hard of a buzz. As I began my travel down the stairs of the theater, I heard this couple talking about how stupid the movie was, and how they are going to ask for a refund. I suddenly smiled, because I hoped that they would get one. I think that I got something out of the film that they didn't. That inside the frames of the movie I felt like I was in good company and had a understanding for the material that they didn't.  What is so good about the Royal Tenenbaums?  The great detail in every frame, from the costumes (and they really are costumes)to the design of Chas, Margot, and Richie rooms and the house. This is brilliant film on every level, a delight for the senses and for the mind. This movie makes you think, and without giving too much away there is a lot of surprises that come from the characters dialogue and their past.  High kudos go to Luke Wilson, I loved his performance as the suffering Richie.  If you loved Rushmore, there is no doubt that you will love this film because it is at par with it, except that its a bit darker in tone.   I think its funny that way that people look at film, we each love or hate a film based on our own perception(and mind there are people who just watch film for entertainment). So if you have a complicated mind and you enjoy watching a challenging film, then the Royal Tenenbaums is for you. As for me, I plan on watching it again so I find more things to love about it. Thank you Wes Anderson, so much. You made laugh, you made me smile and I cried. A thousand times, thank you!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Royal Tenenbaums", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4067992601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjVkYmRkZDItZjBhOC00NGEwLThkNGEtODgzY2ExY2E3YzQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjVkYmRkZDItZjBhOC00NGEwLThkNGEtODgzY2ExY2E3YzQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Royal Tenenbaums", "uploadDate": "2012-10-27T03:38:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000432/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gene Hackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0000432?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Royal Tenenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001774/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ben Stiller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0001774?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chas Tenenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005561/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Luke Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0005561?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Richie Tenenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000195/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bill Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0000195?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Raleigh St. Clair"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001025/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Seymour Cassel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0001025?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dusty"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000285/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Alec Baldwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0000285?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Narrator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0583664/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jonah Meyerson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0583664?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Uzi Tenenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1096941/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Irina Gorovaia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm1096941?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Young Margot Tenenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001378/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Anjelica Huston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0001378?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Etheline Tenenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000569/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gwyneth Paltrow"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0000569?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Margot Tenenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005562/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Owen Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0005562?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Eli Cash"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000418/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Danny Glover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0000418?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Henry Sherman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0657785/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kumar Pallana"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0657785?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Pagoda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0742655/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Grant Rosenmeyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm0742655?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ari Tenenbaum"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1095009/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Aram Aslanian-Persico"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0265666/characters/nm1095009?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Young Chas Tenenbaum"}]}]}

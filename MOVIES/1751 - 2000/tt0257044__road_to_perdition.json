Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER, a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. What it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal.\n\nThis story of a hit man (Tom Hanks) and his relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also his boss, an elderly Irish mob leader (Paul Newman) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past. The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom.\n\nThat being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have ever seen. Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel. Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color, and he and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks, blues and grays that dominate the movie's color scheme.\n\nIf I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch, with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic \"man you love to hate\", the spoiled, impulsive son of Newman's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film's riveting second half. But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here. If a Rolls-Royce was a movie , I've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Road to Perdition", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi696301081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyNzQzMDY2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTUwMzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyNzQzMDY2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTUwMzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Road to Perdition", "uploadDate": "2016-10-01T01:04:12Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0388382/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tyler Hoechlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0257044/characters/nm0388382?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Sullivan Jr."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0014582/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Liam Aiken"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0257044/characters/nm0014582?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Peter Sullivan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000158/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tom Hanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0257044/characters/nm0000158?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Michael Sullivan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0185819/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Daniel Craig"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0257044/characters/nm0185819?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Connor Rooney"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1177237/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Craig Spidle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0257044/characters/nm1177237?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Rooney's Henchman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0242773/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Stephen P.

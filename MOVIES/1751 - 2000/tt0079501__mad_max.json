Max Rockatansky is iconic hero till it's day he is a true legend. Mad Max settle Mel Gibson a sure path to superstardom this highly acclaimed crazy collide o-scope of highway of mayhem cinematically defined the post apocalyptic landscape. Featuring eye- popping stunts that are electrifying and very convincing and an authentically nihilistic spirit this unforgettable actioner from Director George Miller is pure cinematic poetry.\n\nIn the ravaged near future, a savage motorcycle gang rules the road. Terrorizing Innocent civilians while tearing up the streets, the ruthless gang laughs in the face of police force hell-bent on stopping them. But they underestimate one officer: Max (Gibson). And when the bikers brutalize Max's best friend and family, they send him into a mad frenzy that leaves him with only one thing left in the world to live for - revenge! Also staring Joanne Samuel,Hugh Keays-Byrne he later started in Mad Max: Fury Road as an Immortan Joe another villain. This actor is fantastic and makes TERRIFIC job of been one of the best villains in the movie history ever. Also starring Steve Bisley, this rugged race car of a film runs on comic book volatility... exhilarating, rowdiness and visual intensity. \n\nI love this film not much as I love Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Mad Max: Furry Road but I still love it. The plot doesn't start until 1.hour ago after Max family is attacked and killed. I love Max's car V8 Interceptor, high speed chases action sequences, that I guarantee you want see in any Action film today. There is any cgi in this film I didn't see them at all. The chases between Max and Toecutter on a motorcycle is fantastic, the crash and death Toecutter scene is AWESOME. I love this movie, I love it. As an dystopian action film is a fantastic that remains a true classic till it's day. The film has one problem that is focusing on max and his love life which is drama that hurts the movie and the plot starts really slow in the film. And between the film becomes very boring. \n\nThe high speed chases on the road makes this movie interesting so that you don't fall asleep. I still don't get that hate for this film, some people are comparing Thunderdome to this film, clamming that is better than Mad Max is and this is the worst one and the weakest film in the franchise which is not. I highly disagree with all of the haters of this film. It Is still good so much better than Thunderdome ever was. I will always take this film over Thunderdome,I have tried many times to take this film as the best one in the series but I couldn't because it does have some problems. \n\nNOTE: The film is not a revenge flick like some people are saying, it is a film about car and motorcycle gang on a road it is Australian post apocalyptic dystopian action film. 7/10 B-", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi961986073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc1Njg1ZDYtODFhYi00NWU2LWIzMjUtZTY5ZDYyMjMyZDAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc1Njg1ZDYtODFhYi00NWU2LWIzMjUtZTY5ZDYyMjMyZDAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Accessible official trailer", "uploadDate": "2020-08-12T08:21:39Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000154/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mel Gibson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0000154?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Max"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0117412/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hugh Keays-Byrne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0117412?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Toecutter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0122898/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tim Burns"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0122898?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Johnny the Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0017505/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lisa Aldenhoven"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0017505?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Nurse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0128059/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Bertrand Cadart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0128059?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Clunk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0149552/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Robina Chaffey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0149552?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Singer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176072/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Mathew Constantine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0176072?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Toddler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0263149/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Reg Evans"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0263149?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Station Master"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0760394/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Joanne Samuel"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0760394?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jessie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001950/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Steve Bisley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0001950?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Jim Goose"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0911818/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Roger Ward"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0911818?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fifi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0102847/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "David Bracks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0102847?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Mudguts"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0131540/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "David Cameron"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0131540?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Underground Mechanic"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0164518/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Stephen Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0164518?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Sarse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0206439/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jerry Day"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0079501/characters/nm0206439?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ziggy"}]}]}

The book is very complex, typically something hard to match with a movie, especially a Netflix Original. Something I liked was Ella Fanning's performance, she did a pretty good job at being Violet. However this just leads to the many issues I have with this film. The portrayal of the mental health issues in movie are not bad however I feel that the story deserved more of an Indie feel and less of a mainstream Hollywood glow. This movie fails to set itself apart from other Netflix originals, whereas the book was 1 in a million. Finch's family is not supposed to be well off at all, however their house shows different. Typical of Netflix. He also, at least for me was not what i pictured. He has the same charm and looks wise he fits but the overall feel is a bit off in my opinion. Many of the details that made this book so amazing were cut out and left behind which is one of the reasons it becomes almost cheesy. I wish this movie had gone through a bit more screening and thought because the book deserved to make a beautiful picture. It's always hard to be satisfied when a book you love becomes a movie, and although this movie is not terrible by any means and still holds some of the things All Of the Bright Places readers love it sadly fell short.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2942156569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3ZjlkMjUtMTg5NC00MTBhLWE0NmQtZTYwOGU2YWQ2OWZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3ZjlkMjUtMTg5NC00MTBhLWE0NmQtZTYwOGU2YWQ2OWZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Dealing with the loss of her sister, introverted Violet Markey (Elle Fanning) rediscovers passion for living when she meets the eccentric and unpredictable Theodore Finch (Justice Smith)", "uploadDate": "2020-02-07T05:09:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1102577/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elle Fanning"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm1102577?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Violet"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3381295/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Alexandra Shipp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm3381295?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kate"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4045841/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lamar Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm4045841?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charlie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6595038/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Felix Mallard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm6595038?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Roamer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1221047/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Keegan-Michael Key"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm1221047?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Embry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4033978/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Chris Grace"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm4033978?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Hudson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11387134/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sharon Ivers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm11387134?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sharon Ivers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0286171/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Nicole Forester"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm0286171?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Demi"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6819854/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Justice Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm6819854?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Finch"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0641290/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Kelli O'Hara"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm0641290?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sheryl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4722966/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Virginia Gardner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm4722966?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Amanda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6475332/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Sofia Hasmik"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm6475332?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Brenda"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005561/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Luke Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm0005561?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "James"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm12185503/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Ivers"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm12185503?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Ivers"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm11387135/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Isabella Fay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3907584/characters/nm11387135?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Suze"}]}]}

Knowing the film is based on Jonathan Lopez's 2008 book, \"The Man Who Made Vermeers\" removes some of the mystique from the story; however Dan Friedkin's (stunt pilot on DUNKIRK) directorial debut is an enticing look at a blending of art history and world history. The screenplay was co-written by John Orloff, Mark Fergus, and Hawk Ostby.\n\nIt's May 29, 1945, three weeks after the fall of Hitler's Reich, and the Dutch military is on a mission to reclaim valuable art and collectibles confiscated by the Nazis during the war. Some of these were hidden in Austrian salt mines by order of Hermann Goring, actions also depicted in the 2014 film, THE MONUMENTS MEN. After serving in the war, Captain Joseph Piller (Claes Bang, \"Dracula\" 2020) is tasked with tracking down those who stole the art, and those who sold the art to Germans. It's a task meant to preserve his country's culture. One particular piece, \"Christ with the Adulteress\" held special significance, as it was billed as 'the last Vermeer', a long lost painting by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer (\"The Girl with the Pearl Earring\"), for which Goring had paid a record price.\n\nInvestigation on this painting led Piller and his assistant Minna (Vicky Krieps, PHANTOM THREAD 2017) to Han Van Meegeren (played with panache by Guy Pearce and his stylish eyebrows). Piller is also helped by his friend Esper Vesser (Roland Moller, ATOMIC BLONDE 2017) who supplies a bit of muscle and brawn. Van Meegeren has a fancy manner of speech, and Piller determines he's the key to the case, and to unlocking what occurred and how. At the same time, the Ministry of Justice (August Diehl, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS 2009) is after Van Meegeren for conspiracy, and the parties end up in court.\n\nPiller and Van Meegeren existed in real life, and though some dramatic license is taken, much of what we see actually happened. Art experts and politics collided. And it's not surprising that egos ruled the day (not unlike today). The twist may or may not be a shocker to those who know the story, but it's still fascinating that folks would risk their lives in such a manner during the darkest of times. It seems opportunists exist regardless of the era. Mr. Bang and Mr. Pearce are both excellent here, and it's quite fun to watch their verbal wranglings. Director Friedkin adds an Epilogue that will surely bring a smile to most viewers.

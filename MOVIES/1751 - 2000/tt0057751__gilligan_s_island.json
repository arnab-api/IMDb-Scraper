They moved it all over the schedule to no avail, but the fans faithfully followed it. It finally took one dreadful mistake to drag Gunsmoke on for a little while longer to finally kill the show. Since then, the show has become a cult hit; now what does that tell you ? That fans really do love the cartoony characters as they learn life's little foibles and lessons the hard way. Gilligan has since become the patron god for all guys with a Peter Pan complex who strive to hold on to their youth, and Skipper Jonas Grumby has become the boss or parent we would all prefer as he hands out chores and punishments with a smile on his face and laughter in his heart. Thurston and Lovee Howell have since become the first images we think of when we picture wealth, prosperity and happiness, and Professor Roy Hinkley is the teacher we would all want who knows his facts and figures and the calmness to explain them. He is criticized for not being able to build a boat, but how many boats do we know he may have tried repeatedly times between episodes ? The show was also made special by the beautiful visages of Ginger Grant and Mary Anne Sommers. Although Ginger probably intimidated a lot more guys than she claims to have dated, I think it was Mary Anne with her quiet innocence and girl-next-door attraction that made her the odds on favorite \"babe\" of the show. The series itself was excellant escapist fun that didn't need to be analyzed. It was created to entertain, and it did that wonderfully well."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Dawn and the Rest", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2073344537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI2MTE1ODEtYWU2Mi00OTQ3LThkM2MtZjIzYzczYTk4NGQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI2MTE1ODEtYWU2Mi00OTQ3LThkM2MtZjIzYzczYTk4NGQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-10-12T17:31:02Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001134/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bob Denver"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057751/characters/nm0001134?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gilligan"}, {"url": "#", "name": "99 episodes, 1964-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000822/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jim Backus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057751/characters/nm0000822?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Thurston Howell III"}, {"url": "#", "name": "99 episodes, 1964-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001481/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tina Louise"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057751/characters/nm0001481?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Ginger Grant"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 1964-1967"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0920171/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dawn Wells"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057751/characters/nm0920171?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mary Ann Summers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 1964-1967"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001308/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alan Hale Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057751/characters/nm0001308?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jonas 'The Skipper' Grumby"}, {"url": "#", "name": "99 episodes, 1964-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0769791/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Natalie Schafer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057751/characters/nm0769791?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mrs. Lovey Howell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "99 episodes, 1964-1992"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0426157/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Russell Johnson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0057751/characters/nm0426157?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Professor Roy Hinkley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 1964-1967"}]}]}

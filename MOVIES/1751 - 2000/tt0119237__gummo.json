Irrespective of whether or not a young man has yet found something important to say at 24, I don't like it that professional directors' careers start well into their thirties. There's a big age gap there that is only talked about in hindsight, after the fact. Perspectives and values change as we grow older, whether or not a young man will mature to the point of recognizing the follies and dreams of his youth or he'll embrace the anger and grow up to be GG Allin, and whether or not settling down to a regular life is a personal betrayal of a former self, I think something like Gummo needs to be made and more of it.\n\nThis is punk filmmaking at its scummiest, the vibe of antisocial angst despair and anger is pure necro punk rock like GG Allin throwing feces at his audience and smashing beer cans open on his head, it's about being violent and eccentric right now as a means of killing time and making something out of tearing down something else. Yet it's also oddly poetic for the same reason. It's not poetic because a kid will eat spaghetti and chocolate in the bathtub or because a kid with bunny ears rides his bike around a post-apocalyptic landscape of trailerpark white trash, but more because it assumes important things can be said through all this. When Korine speaks of life and death, whether or not life is worth living, when he attakcs society as complacent and apathetic, the results feel immature to me: this is reaction from a vantage point of being too young to start caring, an act of vandalism from the safe point of having your own thing wrecked. But it's good to have these things captured on film then thrown away for anyone who might wanna find them.\n\nI read a bit about Trash Humpers and it seems Harmony Korine doesn't feel there's anything to grow out of. Watching him in his Letterman interviews gives me a clue to all this: the guy is awkward but he's cute awkward, the kind of awkward women want to hold in their arms. I know a skater guy like this, he's 30 years old but looks 25, has his face pierced and hair colored blue or magenta for as long as I've known him, and is endearingly weird. He's never had a shortage of girlfriends. He reminds me of Gummo where despair and malaise plays like a sort of lifestyle. Real awkward people, people who really can't get anywhere in life, don't make movies. I'd like to see their Gummos, this is a bit too cute."}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Gummo", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3198877977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDIwZWI1NWMtNTY1Mi00ZjEyLWFkZDctYjk1MzI5MTY1MzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDIwZWI1NWMtNTY1Mi00ZjEyLWFkZDctYjk1MzI5MTY1MzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Fine Line", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:21:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0786580/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jacob Sewell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119237/characters/nm0786580?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Bunny Boy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0869164/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lara Tosh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119237/characters/nm0869164?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Girl in Car"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0234829/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Darby Dougherty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119237/characters/nm0234829?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Darby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0323244/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carisa Glucksman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119237/characters/nm0323244?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Helen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0349954/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Casey Guzak"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119237/characters/nm0349954?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Skinhead #2"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0492454/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "James Lawhorn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0119237/characters/nm0492454?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Cowboy #1"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0808126/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ellen M.

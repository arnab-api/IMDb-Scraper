The story is a bit convoluted and not terribly credible - just as was often the case with Morse.\n\nThe two leads still have some way to go. Lewis is older, wiser and sadder, which unfortunately means that he is less fun to watch. He also, obviously, lacks Morse to react to, which was one of the most entertaining things about the earlier series.\n\nInstead he has his sidekick played by Laurence Fox. He is OK and has potential, but he is not yet firing on all cylinders by any means. In fact, he seems a bit sleepy and is too deadpan. However, I fully intend to keep watching, and am optimistic that there will be good things in the future.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Inspector Lewis: The Point Of Vanishing", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1294056473", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgwZjZjMTUtYzEwYi00OTc5LWE0MmMtNWQ4ZmJhNWM5MWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgwZjZjMTUtYzEwYi00OTc5LWE0MmMtNWQ4ZmJhNWM5MWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Inspector Lewis: The Point Of Vanishing", "uploadDate": "2019-06-19T13:03:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0923610/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Whately"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0874608/characters/nm0923610?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "DI Robert Lewis"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0391600/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Clare Holman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0874608/characters/nm0391600?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Laura Hobson"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0289114/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Laurence Fox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0874608/characters/nm0289114?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "DS James Hathaway"}, {"url": "#", "name": "42 episodes, 2006-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0296410/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rebecca Front"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0874608/characters/nm0296410?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent"}, {"url": "#", "name": "36 episodes, 2006-2014"}]}]}

I got the movie on VHS for my birthday after it was released and I watched it pretty much every weekend at least twice but now that the movie is over twenty years old and I'm an adult with much better taste in movies I thought I'd watch the movie again on Blu Ray and give a review on my nostalgic experience and see if my opinion on the movie has changed much over the years.\n\nThe first thing I will say about Batman & Robin is that it's the worst Batman movie of them all hands down no amount of nostalgia or good memories of the movie will change that it is simply awful but having said that it's still a fun movie to watch simply because of how over the top and cheesy the movie is from the over the top acting down to the absolutely terrible Batman jokes like the Bat Credit card and the hilarious Mr Freeze one liners told by Arnold Schwarzenegger himself it is impossible not to laugh when watching this movie it's not the serious Batman movie we wanted and it doesn't do the Batman character justice at all.\n\nThis movie alone was the reason we didn't get a Batman movie for eight years because Batman & Robin failed completely and almost killed the franchise luckily in 2005 we got Batman Begins which introduced the true Dark Knight and would lead to the greatest Batman movie ever made in 2008 Batman The Dark Knight.\n\nI love the cast involved Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze is hilarious and Uma Thurman as the sexy, seductive Poison Ivy she really makes a deadly character like Poison Ivy a lot of fun and she really does make the character look sexy as hell.\n\nThis movie is absolutely hilarious and is a guilty pleasure for me I don't watch it because it's a good movie I watch it simply because it's entertaining and enjoyable it's essentially Batman the parody it's not to be taken seriously it's a bunch of famous actors dressing in spandex so tight we actually get crotch and butt close ups so if you've always wanted to see a Bat suit with actual nipples and a cod peice then your in luck. This isn't the best Batman movie but try and enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of entertaining fun.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Batman And Robin", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi884539673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjNkOGU2OGUtODEyZC00MmVkLWFhM2YtYzY4ZThiOTRkMWMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjNkOGU2OGUtODEyZC00MmVkLWFhM2YtYzY4ZThiOTRkMWMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:24:27Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000216/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000216?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mr. Freeze"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000216?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Victor Fries"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000563/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Chris O'Donnell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000563?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Robin"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000563?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dick Grayson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000224/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alicia Silverstone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000224?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Batgirl"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000224?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Barbara Wilson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0385757/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Pat Hingle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0385757?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Commissioner Gordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000512/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Elle Macpherson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000512?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Julie Madison"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0456971/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Vendela Kirsebom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0456971?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nora Fries"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0842422/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jeep Swenson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0842422?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0533197/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Michael Reid MacKay"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0533197?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Antonio Diego"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0533197?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bane"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000123/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "George Clooney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000123?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Batman"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000123?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bruce Wayne"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000235/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Uma Thurman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000235?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Poison Ivy"}, {"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000235?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dr. Pamela Isley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001284/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Michael Gough"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0001284?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Alfred Pennyworth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001278/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "John Glover"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0001278?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Doctor Jason Woodrue"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000407/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Vivica A.

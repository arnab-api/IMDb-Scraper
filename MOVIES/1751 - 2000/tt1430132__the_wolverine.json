Vulnerable for the first time and pushed to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle against his own immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before. But when wolverine is most vulnerable, he's most dangerous . In Japan young Yashida gives Wolverine a samurai sword with 6 Kanji letters engraved on it. These Kanji read: \"Never Died, Never Aged, Never Destroyed\".

Nice acting by Hugh Jackman , he said that with this picture , he finally achieved the physique that he always envisioned in his mind that Wolverine should have. He said that for some reason, on each of his 5 prior takes at the character, he felt that he never had enough time to get in shape; for this film he finally had enough time, and got his body exactly the way he wanted it to look. Famke Janssen filmed her Jean Gray cameo in three days , this role is vital to the movie, particularly for him confronting the most difficult thing within himself . Special effects by Weta Digital are fantastic but they don't overshadow the story . The film contains an impressive, breathtaking ending battle plenty of computer generator effects . For the bullet train fight, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a green-screen. The moving background came from filming on an elevated freeway in Tokyo.

The ideas of immortality reign very heavily in this story, and the burden of immortality weighs heavily on Logan. For me that's such an interesting part of Logan's character that it is nearly impossible to explore in a prequel\" .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2302846489", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDUxODQ4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ0MTc2OQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDUxODQ4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ0MTc2OQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In modern day Japan, Wolverine is out of his depth in an unknown world as he faces his ultimate nemesis in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed.

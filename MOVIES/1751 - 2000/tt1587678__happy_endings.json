I started watching some episode because it aired right after Modern family. But after watching a couple of random episodes, I started to get interested.\n\nThe characters really grew on me, I really recognize my friends and I through them. It's funny, touching at times, well written and intelligent. They make lots of references to movies, TV shows, celebrities, so if you don't watch a lot of movies and television, you may have some trouble understanding everything. \n\nIt's refreshing to see a gay character who's not a drama queen, typical type of gay guy you see on TV. Adam Pally, who plays the gay character, is awesome and my favorite. It's also so refreshing to see an interracial couple (black and white), that openly make jokes about their differences. \n\nThe only thing I don't really like about this show, is Elisha Cuthbert. Although I like her and I think she is so pretty, I don't think she plays her character well. I feel like she can't find her place with the others and she doesn't really fit, like she's missing something. A lot of times, I just find her awkward. But that's just my opinion. I'll still watch the show. Maybe she'll get better with time. \n\nSo overall, I think it's a super cool show. And please do not compare this series with Friends, this has nothing to do with it. It's too easy to say they are friends and do stuff together, and compare characters. It's so much more than that. I never really liked Friends and I love this show. They can't re-invent the wheel. We all have friends, a lot of them resemble others, it's based on real life that's it. \n\nI really recommend everyone to at least watch season 1 :) Then you can judge by yourself :)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Blu-Ray Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2827533849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JlNDViOTAtNjNiYy00MjFiLThhMTEtM2VkNzlmODQ5MGU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JlNDViOTAtNjNiYy00MjFiLThhMTEtM2VkNzlmODQ5MGU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-04-06T09:55:45Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2255288/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Eliza Coupe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587678/characters/nm2255288?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jane Kerkovich-Williams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2011-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0461149/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zachary Knighton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587678/characters/nm0461149?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dave Rose"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2011-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915458/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Damon Wayans Jr."}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587678/characters/nm0915458?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Brad Williams"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2011-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0193846/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Elisha Cuthbert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587678/characters/nm0193846?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alex Kerkovich"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2011-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1269723/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Adam Pally"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587678/characters/nm1269723?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Max Blum"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2011-2020"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1988111/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Casey Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1587678/characters/nm1988111?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Penny Hartz"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2011-2020"}]}]}

Nevertheless, such a program came into fruition in the form of Silver Spoons, when it debuted on NBC in September 1982. Joel Higgins was perfect as Edward Stratton III, a wealthy man who discovers that he is the father of a 12-year-old boy named Ricky Stratton, played by Ricky Schroder. But who could have guessed that someone like Ricky Schroder, known for dramatic movies such as The Champ and The Earthling, would star in a sitcom? Regardless, Schroder was great as Ricky Stratton.\n\nSilver Spoons is an enjoyable sitcom. The series ran for five years, on NBC from 1982 to 1986 and in first-run syndication from 1986 to 1987. It produced a total of 116 episodes. That was a good run. It has been over thirty years since the series ended its run, but I still have fond memories of it."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005401/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ricky Schroder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083479/characters/nm0005401?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ricky Stratton"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 1982-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0383415/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Joel Higgins"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083479/characters/nm0383415?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Edward Stratton III"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 1982-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005355/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alfonso Ribeiro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083479/characters/nm0005355?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alfonso Spears"}, {"url": "#", "name": "72 episodes, 1984-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001292/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Erin Gray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083479/characters/nm0001292?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Kate Summers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "116 episodes, 1982-1987"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0780546/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Franklyn Seales"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0083479/characters/nm0780546?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dexter Stuffins"}, {"url": "#", "name": "96 episodes, 1983-1987"}]}]}

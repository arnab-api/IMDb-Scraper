I liked it a lot but being around 10 I don't think I really appreciated all it had to offer. Compared to what's on TV these days (I know this makes me sound old. OK, point taken.) the writing was very good. The interplay between Lucas & Mark was genuine; I understand they were fast friends until Connors' death. The only thing I didn't understand was why North Fork even needed a sheriff; Lucas bailed Micah out nearly every week. Oh, well....\n\nIt's running on Encore right now. I'm just glad to see that somebody in authority has realized that these old shows shouldn't be dismissed just because they were filmed in black & white. It's the quality of the product that matters. I'm hoping to see Have Gun Will Travel, The Life & Legend of Wyatt Earp, The Rebel, and other shows of this era soon too.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "MeTV Promo Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2913648921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODg1NTQ1MDUtZWQ4Zi00ZWQ0LTkzN2ItN2QyYTcwZmZhNTg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODg1NTQ1MDUtZWQ4Zi00ZWQ0LTkzN2ItN2QyYTcwZmZhNTg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The adventures of a Wild West rancher, wielding a customized rapid-fire Winchester rifle, and his son.", "uploadDate": "2020-09-22T08:40:33Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0168035/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chuck Connors"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051308/characters/nm0168035?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lucas McCain"}, {"url": "#", "name": "168 episodes, 1958-1963"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0280707/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paul Fix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051308/characters/nm0280707?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Micah Torrance"}, {"url": "#", "name": "148 episodes, 1958-1963"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0186844/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Johnny Crawford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0051308/characters/nm0186844?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mark McCain"}, {"url": "#", "name": "168 episodes, 1958-1963"}]}]}

In it, Stone plays a repressed 26 year old virgin who repairs broken dolls and sees a psychiatrist (Ronny Cox) who keeps trying to free her of her repressed childhood memories. Things take a bizarre turn when she's attacked in the elevator by a red headed man with a beard and she stabs him with a pair of scissors. He leaves, but not before taking her purse and keys. She begins living in fear that, one day, he'll return and finish the job.\n\nEnter a kindly actor neighbor and his invalid creep of a brother who both take a liking to our heroine as her mental stability takes a turn. She's eventually called on to interview for a job at a fancy new loft and ends up locked in, further complicating her already fragile mental state.\n\nThere's a lot going on in Scissors and most of it doesn't need to be there. The entire subplot with the two brothers could have been dropped completely since the payoff isn't interesting enough to warrant its inclusion in the first place. Stone is good, especially when she finally starts losing her mind. The final twist is far fetched, but does make some sense in the grand scheme of things. It's just a shame that the movie spends so much time on characters and subplots that feel like they're from a different film entirely.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000232/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sharon Stone"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0000232?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Angela Anderson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001074/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ronny Cox"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0001074?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Stephan Carter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0292822/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Vicki Frederick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0292822?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nancy Leahy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0446195/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Austin Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0446195?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Folger"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0504009/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Will Leskin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0504009?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Billy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0146493/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Laura Caulfield"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0146493?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Actress on Soap Opera"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0725747/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hal Riddle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0725747?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Male Dog Walker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0788203/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Jim Shankman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0788203?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bob the Clerk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0706883/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Steve Railsback"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0706883?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alex Morgan"}, {"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0706883?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Cole Morgan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0680645/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michelle Phillips"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0680645?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ann Carter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0609025/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Larry Moss"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0609025?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Kramer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0305266/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jesse Garcia"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0305266?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Counterman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0214472/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ivy Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0214472?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0187790/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Ed Crick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0187790?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Frank Brady"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0079199/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ivy Bethune"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0102860/characters/nm0079199?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Female Dog Walker"}]}]}

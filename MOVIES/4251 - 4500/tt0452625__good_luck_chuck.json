Personally, this wasn't my favorite Dane Cook movie, but it wasn't the worst, I really liked him in this movie. My brother has Dane Cook's CD and I heard it, and I was like....this guy is kinda offensive...but funny, in a way. However on the screen Dane comes out looking good. I'm not going to spoil the movie for ya, but I will tell you it's great.\n\nA lot of women didn't like Dane Cook, and I don't know why, I saw him in a magazine and I was like...this guy is kinda cute. My husband he disagrees obviously, but he likes Dane Cook now, and he says he's a pretty funny guy.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Jessica Alba, but I liked her in the Fantastic Four movies and thought she did a really good job, but could she do a chick flick, duh.\n\nI liked the connection between the two actors, you can really feel it as an audience member and it made you believe that they could actually be in a relationship that works. I got to tell ya, the whole curse thing, that would creep me out, but I guess Dane's character is alright with that, is it a chick thing? 6/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Good Luck Chuck Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2981167385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMzY2OTU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkzNjUy._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMzY2OTU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkzNjUy._V1_.jpg", "description": "In order to keep the woman of his dreams from falling for another guy, Charlie Logan has to break the curse that has made him wildly popular with single women: Sleep with Charlie once, and the next man you meet will be your true love.", "uploadDate": "2007-08-30T12:29:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1161069/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Connor Price"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm1161069?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Young Charlie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2342090/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mackenzie Mowat"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm2342090?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Birthday Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2301758/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Caroline Ford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm2301758?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jennifer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0799706/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Chelan Simmons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm0799706?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Carol"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2483617/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Natalie Morris"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm2483617?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Natalie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0874908/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Tseng Chang"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm0874908?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Karaoke Singer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0953065/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Chiara Zanni"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm0953065?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bride"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0281619/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Carrie Anne Fleming"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm0281619?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dirty Talker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1795630/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Troy Gentile"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm1795630?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Young Stu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1199888/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sasha Pieterse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm1199888?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Goth Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176981/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dane Cook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm0176981?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Charlie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0283945/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dan Fogler"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm0283945?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Stu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0257613/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ellia English"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm0257613?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Reba"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1083137/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Michael Teigen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm1083137?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Wedding D.J."}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1534707/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Benjamin Ayres"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0452625/characters/nm1534707?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Groomsman"}]}]}

The rest of the actors are also good (I think the black guy is the blind character from \"Becker\"--I could be wrong), but Vince Vaughn steals the show as the smooth-talking Trent.  We all have friends like Trent.  Some of us aspire to be like Trent.  Some of us are Trent.  I admit, I would compare myself more to Favreau's character--the more reserved, sensitive type.  But the great thing about a film like this is it's down to earth.  It's about everyday people in everyday situations, and I guarantee many of us can relate to the characters in \"Swingers\" in one way or another, just like how many of us relate to the characters on \"Seinfeld.\" This isn't a plot-driven film, so you can call this a movie about nothing. It's simply about a group of studs on the prowl, hitting the clubs and casinos, and sharing their philosophies on sex and dating.  There are several films that tried to replicate this format and failed (\"Whipped\" comes to mind).  \n\nIf you're in the mood to laugh hysterically and be wildly entertained, \"Swingers\" is the movie for you.  About my only criticisms would be a few lame attempts to be stylish.  Come on, would 5 guys really drive in their own cars and follow each other all the way without anyone cutting them off? \n\n My score:  8 (out of 10)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Swingers", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1171299865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZmNjE5NGEtMjAyYy00ZjYzLTgzNDAtNzE4ZGFiYjZkNWM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZmNjE5NGEtMjAyYy00ZjYzLTgzNDAtNzE4ZGFiYjZkNWM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT #1", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:49:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269463/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jon Favreau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0269463?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0515296/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Ron Livingston"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0515296?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0246373/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Alex D\u00e9sert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0246373?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Charles"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0552172/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Deena Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0552172?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Christy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0486728/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Brooke Langton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0486728?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Nikki"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0446575/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Kevin James Kelly"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0446575?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Vegas Dealer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0891259/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Vernon Vaughn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0891259?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "$100 Gambler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0352513/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Rio Hackford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0352513?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Skully"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000681/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Vince Vaughn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0000681?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Trent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0887187/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Patrick Van Horn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0887187?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sue"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001287/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Heather Graham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0001287?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Lorraine"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0124997/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Katherine Kendall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0124997?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lisa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0512420/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Blake Lindsley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0512420?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Girl with Cigar"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0411808/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Stephanie Ittleson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0411808?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Vegas Waitress"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0269462/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Joan Favreau"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0117802/characters/nm0269462?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "$5 Winner"}]}]}

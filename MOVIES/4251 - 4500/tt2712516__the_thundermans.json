The show really makes me smile, it's awesome, cool, fun and a lot more positive words. The actors did great in portraying each role. Btw, if you don't want any fictional things like superpowers don't watch it.\n\nI think Phoebe, played by Kira Kosarin is really sweet, charming and even if she's kind-of a nerd she is still stylish and playful that she could be a popular girl in school, Kosarin did a great job in portraying Phoebe Thunderman.\n\nI think Max, played by Jack Griffo is really awesome and you can feel that he really loves to be a villain so bad. This character really got my attention to continue watching the show and it's going to be a boring if he isn't in the show. Griffo did a awesome job!\n\nI think Nora, played by Addison Riecke is super cute and makes me wanna hug her, she has it all, I think she didn't even exerted any effort for portraying Nora. Reicke portrayed the youngest in the family cool.\n\nI think Billy, played by Diego Velazquez is so awesome, you can't get bored watching it with his \"dumbness\" and \"smartness\". I'm telling you you better watch out for his parts. Veleazquez did a really good job in portraying Billy.\n\nFor both the parents Hank and Barb, played by Chris Tallman (Hank) and Rosa Blasi (Barb) I love it how they take care of their children and how they make the show awesome for being cool parents. Tallman and Blasi did a great job for being the parents of the thunderkids. \n\nThat is why even if you hate superpower shows yo better watch this and this could be your newest favorite show.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1486404121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNiM2QxNGMtMzAwNC00OTUwLWE1ZTMtNDg3MWQ1MzkyZGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNiM2QxNGMtMzAwNC00OTUwLWE1ZTMtNDg3MWQ1MzkyZGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-10-15T23:05:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4114500/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kira Kosarin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm4114500?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Phoebe Thunderman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5196965/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Addison Riecke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm5196965?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nora Thunderman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848182/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Chris Tallman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm0848182?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Hank Thunderman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1075468/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dana Snyder"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm1075468?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dr. Colosso"}, {"url": "#", "name": "91 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7419782/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Maya Le Clark"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm7419782?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Chloe Thunderman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "55 episodes, 2015-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4338976/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jack Griffo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm4338976?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Max Thunderman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3357633/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Diego Velazquez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm3357633?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Billy Thunderman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0087726/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Rosa Blasi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm0087726?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Barb Thunderman"}, {"url": "#", "name": "98 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0158008/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Edward Chiodo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm0158008?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Puppeteer"}, {"url": "#", "name": "1 episode, 2013-2016"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2733899/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Audrey Whitby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2712516/characters/nm2733899?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cherry Seinfeld"}, {"url": "#", "name": "43 episodes, 2013-2018"}]}]}

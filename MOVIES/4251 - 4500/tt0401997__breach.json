His hopes are both raised and dashed when he is assigned to work with veteran agent Robert Hanssen, who is a known sexual defiant. The FBI want to know who else has been involved with his internet postings and require O'Neill to log every action, every comment and find out as much as possible while essentially also working as a clerk. A job is a job but O'Neill finds himself quite liking the grouchy but amiable senior agent and wondering what the point of this assignment is, as he appears to be wasting his time.\n\nBased on a true story, so I'm not sure how much of the detail (or even sweep) is true or artistic license, this is a quite satisfying drama that surprised me by how much I liked it. I hadn't heard anything really about it before watching it and I assumed it would be the usual spy thriller a la The Recruit, with twisty plots, running with guns and shouting. Instead what I got was a much slower and quieter drama that takes as much from the characters as it does from the story itself. It is not an easy sell but it works because the delivery \"gets\" what is required. The sweep of the narrative is engaging but what makes it succeed is the way it builds the two central characters so they are both of value to the viewer. I didn't think that O'Neill was the main character so much as a required device to get the audience involved with Hanssen. This allows the complex character to be built up and, while never totally understood, I was left with conflicting emotions about him and his motivations for what he did.\n\nI have not put that very well but with this in mind the performances are key. I'm not a big fan of Phillippe to say the least but here he does good restrained work. He is not brilliant but he does just what the film needs. What he seems to benefit from is a great turn from Cooper. Cooper plays all the conflicting parts of his character really well so that, while not making total sense, they convince as reality. It is a great performance and he does make the film. In smaller roles Linney, Cole Quinlan and Haysbert are nice finds that add a sense of quality to the film. Dhavernas didn't work that well for me and it was just as well that her character's involvement was minimal.\n\nBreach is a grown-up spy film, not one for those looking for twisty narrative with a running and shouting conclusion. It delivers a satisfying story where we already know the ending and it does it by building the characters and relationships around the lead two to draw the viewer in. The performances from Cooper and Phillippe are worthy of the material as well, doing it justice and making it work."}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177933/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chris Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0401997/characters/nm0177933?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Hanssen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001473/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Linney"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0401997/characters/nm0001473?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kate Burroughs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0170550/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gary Cole"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0401997/characters/nm0170550?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rich Garces"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000599/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kathleen Quinlan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0401997/characters/nm0000599?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Bonnie Hanssen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0915093/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jonathan Watton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0401997/characters/nm0915093?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Geddes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0693436/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Jonathan Potts"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0401997/characters/nm0693436?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "D.I.A.

Sincerely glad it brought you laughter and joy)\n\nNot to take the first film too serious, but it did have heart. Lloyd's speech at the beginning of the first one, it felt sincere. There was a great sense of desperation in his lonely hopes of having more friends.\n\nAs the first film goes on, it's amusing and funny seeing exactly why he and Harry can't have friends (\"You don't kill people you don't know, that's the rule.\" *minutes after meeting Harry and Lloyd, pulls for his gun*), and even getting insight into Lloyd's warped mind of what it could be like to live a more active social life (joking with friends by the fireplace, pleasant dinner with lovely girlfriend, chomping on someone's nuts and ripping out a chef's heart....)\n\nthe first film literally starts on Hope Street.\n\nBest of all, I love that at the end of everything, Harry and Lloyd still at least have each other.\n\nNo, it wasn't a big quality film, it was largely a string of dumb jokes. But if you pay enough attention, you'll find there's fantastic warmth and even a story going on (outside of what seems to be the main point of returning a briefcase), both of which is severely missing in the latest film.\n\nI did laugh a bit throughout. But, Carrey and Daniels were more of glorified cartoon parodies rather the two characters we saw 20 years ago. The entire world itself felt like a glorified cartoon parody with loose sight of the first film.\n\nAnyone needing a laugh, the film may deliver, but your old pals Harry and Lloyd, and the world you were acquainted with 20 years ago, won't be there."}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4022184985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MDc2NjI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5Njk5MTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MDc2NjI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5Njk5MTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "20 years after the dimwits set out on their first adventure, they head out in search of one of their long lost children in the hope of gaining a new kidney.", "uploadDate": "2014-06-13T12:30:42Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000120/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim Carrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0000120?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lloyd"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1443527/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rob Riggle"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm1443527?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Travis"}, {"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm1443527?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Captain Lippincott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1560493/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rachel Melvin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm1560493?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Penny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0482141/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Don Lake"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0482141?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Dr. Meldmann"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6151647/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Elizabeth Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm6151647?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mrs. Julie James"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000195/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Bill Murray"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0000195?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ice Pick"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0085860/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Paul Blackthorne"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0085860?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Emergency Room Doctor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1102244/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Eddie Shin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm1102244?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gordy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001099/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jeff Daniels"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0001099?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Harry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0390229/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Laurie Holden"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0390229?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Adele"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0003493/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Steve Tom"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0003493?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dr. Pinchelow"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0294170/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Patricia French"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0294170?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ms. Sourpuss"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000678/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kathleen Turner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0000678?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Fraida"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0516806/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Tembi Locke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0516806?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dr. Walcott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0089603/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Brady Bluhm"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2096672/characters/nm0089603?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Billy"}]}]}

The first couple of seasons were highly inventive, and then around season three things really took a turn for the worse, I'm guessing there was an effort to cut costs; i.e. stop shooting on location in San Francisco, and maybe throw in some repeatable elements to further cut costs (introduce a returning villain so the group can revisit worlds to cut down on production costs).\n\nThe result; a disaster. I saw the first several episodes of Season One, then got busy and only saw a few episodes of Season Two, and then when one of the \"returning villains\" first reared their head, I completely tuned out the show.\n\nThe first couple of seasons were about parallel Earths, and the main characters visiting the such. The rest of the series became about \"fighting the bad guys\", and the uniqueness of the show just lost whatever shine or attractiveness it ever had. In short, it became a junk show, and there was only one character left who had been completely turned around from what he was supposed to be.\n\nIt just strikes me as odd. I mean has any TV series improved and been prolonged by a cut in budget or with cost saving elements introduced into the production? Did original Star Trek in the 1960s see a full five year mission? Did Spielberg's Amazing Stories continue for a third and fourth season? How many non-sitcoms went onto legendary status because of budget cuts? How many improved or lasted with renown because of budget cuts? None, really.\n\nSo, that's pretty much all there is to it. Even Babylon-5, for as much as I disliked the show, really didn't drop off in terms of show quality. But Sliders, which was made around the same time, just essentially disintegrated. All you can do is shrug your shoulders and forget about the poor stuff.\n\nI mean, think about it, there was no series finale. There was only one character left from the original cast. And no one ever got home.\n\nI mean there are more reasons for the show's ultimate demise, but those were the big ones, and as a result we get this saga that started out strong, but then became something completely unrecognizable, and essentially garbage. \n\nSee the first couple of seasons, if you must, then move onto something else."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sliders: Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi288599833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ5NmUzMDgtNjM1MC00NjVhLWI0Y2UtNTY1NjY2ODhjNmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQ5NmUzMDgtNjM1MC00NjVhLWI0Y2UtNTY1NjY2ODhjNmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Complete Series trailer", "uploadDate": "2014-10-25T04:59:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0220598/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cleavant Derricks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112167/characters/nm0220598?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Rembrandt 'Crying Man' Brown"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 1995-2000"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001863/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Kari Wuhrer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112167/characters/nm0001863?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Maggie Beckett"}, {"url": "#", "name": "49 episodes, 1997-2000"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0722636/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Rhys-Davies"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112167/characters/nm0722636?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Prof. Maximilian Arturo"}, {"url": "#", "name": "40 episodes, 1995-1997"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005278/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jerry O'Connell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112167/characters/nm0005278?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Quinn Mallory"}, {"url": "#", "name": "69 episodes, 1995-2000"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005158/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Sabrina Lloyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112167/characters/nm0005158?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Wade Welles"}, {"url": "#", "name": "47 episodes, 1995-1999"}]}]}

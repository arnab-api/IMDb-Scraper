The visuals, the costumes, the set decoration, the changing colors cinematography and the soundtrack in this darker than dark comedy are stunning - the grandmasters were working on the movie. Among them Peter Greenaway, first and foremost a painter and a fine one, his brilliant cinematographer Sasha Verny, his astounding composer Michael Nyman who used for the movie the incredible \"Memorial\", and Jean-Paul Gaultier who designed the costumes. It also helped that Helen Mirren (as the long suffering wife, Georgina who in the end will serve her husband very well cooked revenge) and Michael Gambon (Albert- the thief, the gangster, the embodiment of pure evil and the owner of the swank restaurant) were two stars. Alan Howard plays a regular guest to whom Georgina is attracted to and carries on an affair with in the restaurant's restrooms and later in the back rooms, with the help of the Artist-cook (Richard Bohringer).\n\nEvery frame of each Greenaway's movie looks and feels like an exquisite painting. \"A Zed and two Naughts\" is Greenaway's homage and admiration for Vermeer. \"The Draughtsman's Contract\" quite openly refers to Caravaggio, Georges de la Tour and other French and Italian artists. \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover\", a fully realized vision of the director, a professional painter Peter Greenaway, is his tribute to the great Flemish and Dutch painters, Frans Hals, in particular. His large group portrait is constantly seen in the background of the hall in the London restaurant Le Hollandais that means \"The Dutchman\". I see Peter Greenaway as Hieronymus Bosch of the cinema, the creator of enormously beautiful, divine canvas depicting all horrors of hell that only humans can inflict on one another.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2706161177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0YzQ1ZDQtYWY0NS00MmUzLWExOWEtZDc3NmU1NjQ1NDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0YzQ1ZDQtYWY0NS00MmUzLWExOWEtZDc3NmU1NjQ1NDNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-28T17:26:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0092184/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard Bohringer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0092184?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Richard"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000545/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Helen Mirren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0000545?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Georgina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000619/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tim Roth"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0000619?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mitchel"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0647653/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Gary Olsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0647653?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Spangler"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004355/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Roger Ashton-Griffiths"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0004355?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Turpin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0809131/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Liz Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0809131?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Grace"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0376983/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Janet Henfrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0376983?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Alice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0020178/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Tony Alleff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0020178?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Troy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002091/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Michael Gambon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0002091?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Albert"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397102/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Alan Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0397102?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Michael"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001354/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ciar\u00e1n Hinds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0001354?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cory"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0829380/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ewan Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0829380?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Harris"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177267/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Ron Cook"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0177267?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mews"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0318930/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Emer Gillespie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0318930?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Patricia"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0106791/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Arnie Breeveld"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0097108/characters/nm0106791?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Eden"}]}]}

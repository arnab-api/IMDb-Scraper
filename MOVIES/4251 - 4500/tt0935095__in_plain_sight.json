In this case, I was glad I did. The pilot started off slow, but after about 30 minutes (it was 90 minutes total w/commercials), it actually became interesting and stayed that way to the end. Subsequent episodes have kept up the momentum.\n\nOne novel aspect of the show is that its about a lady marshal in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She's in charge of people in the \"witness protection program\" who have been assigned to her area. She cautions and reassures them that since 1970 (when the witness program started), \"No one who has followed the rules has ever been harmed.\" Powerful words. \n\nCan they comply? When things go wrong, can she protect them? How can she keep their identities safe - even from the local police?\n\nAside from the setup, the show is ultimately interesting because she's fun to watch. She's sassy, witty, playful, smart, responsible ... and physically tough. I recommend watching an episode; if the lead character grabs your interest, then you're likely to enjoy the show."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "In Plain Sight: Second Crime Around", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3022437657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDYyNTFlMTgtMjhmNi00YWU3LTlkYjItYmI4MjgwN2ZlYzZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDYyNTFlMTgtMjhmNi00YWU3LTlkYjItYmI4MjgwN2ZlYzZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In Plain Sight: Second Crime Around", "uploadDate": "2019-04-10T13:18:15Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005203/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mary McCormack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0935095/characters/nm0005203?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mary Shannon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0070115/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Paul Ben-Victor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0935095/characters/nm0070115?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Stan McQueen"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000690/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Lesley Ann Warren"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0935095/characters/nm0000690?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Jinx Shannon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "28 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0919867/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Frederick Weller"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0935095/characters/nm0919867?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Marshall Mann"}, {"url": "#", "name": "61 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0385346/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nichole Hiltz"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0935095/characters/nm0385346?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Brandi Shannon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "50 episodes, 2008-2012"}]}]}

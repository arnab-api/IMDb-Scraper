It hooks you in fast and really grabs hold. It's very good in that aspect because it really makes you care about what happens. The story involves a parent's worst nightmare, so I would expect moms and dads to be particularly horrified. The movie manipulates, no doubt being overdone here and there, but it's generally effective.\n\nAngelina Jolie does a superb job of portraying a Los Angeles woman (\"Christine Collins\") in the late 1920s whose boy is kidnapped. Five months later, the \"proud\" police department brings her kid back, making it a good PR session. Unfortunately, it's not her kid and stupidly, although she's naturally upset about, she poses with the kid and takes him home. (Would that really happen?). \n\nThen she begins her quest of finding her real \"Walter.\" Further twists and turns make the story increasingly horrifying. In all, you won't be able to keep your eyes off the screen wondering if justice will ever prevail in the end and who exactly is involved in what. It's not particularly a fun ride - you'll have a frown on your face for quite some time - but it sure is interesting and an excellent two hour-plus of entertainment. By the end, you'll be emotionally exhausted.\n\nKudos to all the actors in here for riveting performances and to the production and design team for a great period piece. Where else can you feel you're back 75-80 years in time with the boxy cars and flapper hats than in movies?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H21M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Changeling: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3944284185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3OTk0NDMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg1NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3OTk0NDMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg1NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Clint Eastwood directs Angelina Jolie in The Changeling, a drama in which a mother's prayer for her kidnapped son to return home is answered, though it doesn't take long for her to suspect the boy who comes back is not hers.", "uploadDate": "2008-09-18T06:59:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001401/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Angelina Jolie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0824747/characters/nm0001401?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Christine Collins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1162421/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Michelle Gunn"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0824747/characters/nm1162421?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sandy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0335389/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Erica Grant"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0824747/characters/nm0335389?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Operator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0709839/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kerri Randles"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0824747/characters/nm0709839?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Operator"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1765859/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Morgan Eastwood"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0824747/characters/nm1765859?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Girl on Tricycle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000518/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "John Malkovich"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0824747/characters/nm0000518?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Rev.

He changes the names to keep the surprise of who he eventually married, and he spins a charming story - spanning fifteen years - of loves lost and found and lost again.\n\nAnd found again.\n\nRyan Reynolds (one of my all-time favourite performers) has seldom been better, Abigail Breslin (who appears frequently to comment on the story being told) is as genuinely charming as ever, and all three girlfriends are wonderfully cast. The story moves along at brisk pace and it's easy to see why the hero would fall in love with each in turn (at various stages in his life). What's not as easy to see is which one he will eventually marry. And, as well as successfully concealing the identity of the mother, the film makes you wonder many times how it will all end. Yes, it's a romantic comedy, so you're conditioned to expect a happy ending, but this isn't your typical romantic comedy so you're expecting a non-typical ending.\n\nAnd you're right.\n\nThe ending is just as clever as the rest of the movie and it makes for a great story overall. It's a very modern story. I think it would have been called \"a sophisticated sex comedy\" in bygone days. Which just means the characters are a bit more mature and closer to real life than you normally find in this genre.\n\nWhat could have been an enjoyable B-grade rom-com is lifted up by unconventional storytelling and a little extra effort spent to get the ending just right. Grade \"A\" from me.\n\nhttp://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Definitely, Maybe", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1051853081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwODk0NzYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTYyMzU4._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwODk0NzYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTYyMzU4._V1_.jpg", "description": "Definitely, Maybe Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-12-07T11:05:11Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005351/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ryan Reynolds"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm0005351?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Will Hayes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1353135/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matthew Mason"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm1353135?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Headphone Guy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0415529/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sakina Jaffrey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm0415529?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "School Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2920344/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ryder Chasin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm2920344?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Boy with Book"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0260632/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dana Eskelson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm0260632?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Angry Girl's Mom"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1105207/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Paulina Gerzon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm1105207?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "School Kid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2919485/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Ashtyn Greenstein"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm2919485?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "School Kid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1483241/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Dylan Hartigan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm1483241?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "School Kid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2480549/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "An Nguyen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm2480549?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ad Exec"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0220257/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Rick Derby"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm0220257?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Visitor from Planet Ordon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1331513/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bob Wiltfong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm1331513?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "School Dad"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2920460/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Fiona Lane"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm2920460?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Angry Girl"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2024169/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Blake Benitez"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm2024169?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "School Kid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2301498/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Victoria Goldsmith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm2301498?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "School Kid"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4155810/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Ashley Grenier"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0832266/characters/nm4155810?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "School Kid"}]}]}

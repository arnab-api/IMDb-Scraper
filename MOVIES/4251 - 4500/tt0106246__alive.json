The reality i felt when watching this movie was how easily we take for granted things like food to eat, clean clothes to wear, and warmth that comes from blankets and heaters. By the middle of the movie (when watching it last night after nearly 10 years) i was aghast at the sheer strength of some of all of the people that survived the initial crash of the actual plane. And when the deciding moment arrives where they must choose whether they are willing to eat human flesh to survive and find a way beyond the Andes, I found i asked myself 'what would you do?'. The answer is, i don't know. i truly don't. This movie makes you realise how precious life is, and how we should never take anything for granted. How we should be thankful of all that we have, and yet how easy it is to lose all that just by a bad twist of fate. Call this movie what you will, I think it's a must-see for everyone because it really happened. There are lessons to be learned, morals to be recognised, and questions to be asked and somehow solved. Each person/character you will encounter in this movie is unique which makes it all the more worthwhile to watch. Because you find yourself sympathetic with the viewpoints of all the men and women in the movie yet at the same time questioning what decision you would make if you were in their place. Maybe we never will know or understand what they went through. But by watching this movie and reading the book, it will help us become wiser people and possibly open our minds to the endless enigma that is life, God, and the vastness and emptiness of the world that lies not so beyond our reach."}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official VHS Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi336576025", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI4Y2IxMzItYjU5ZS00MzQ1LWIwZjUtY2Y3YjAzZDI0NmViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI4Y2IxMzItYjU5ZS00MzQ1LWIwZjUtY2Y3YjAzZDI0NmViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-07-16T14:29:38Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000160/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ethan Hawke"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106246/characters/nm0000160?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nando Parrado"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0357979/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Josh Hamilton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106246/characters/nm0357979?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Roberto Canessa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0628542/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "John Newton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106246/characters/nm0628542?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Antonio 'Tint\u00edn' Vizint\u00edn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0108362/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Kevin Breznahan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106246/characters/nm0108362?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Roy Harley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001152/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Illeana Douglas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0106246/characters/nm0001152?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Lilliana Methol"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0580063/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Christian J.

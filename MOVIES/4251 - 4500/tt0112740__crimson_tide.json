The acting and action was excellent as could be expected from such a cast so my comments are really centred on the story line and its presentation.  Set in the scenario of the post-cold war Russia, which is still with us,  the basic confrontation which faces every naval commander of a nuclear submarine was brought to stark reality in this film.  Who has the final say when it comes to pushing the button? Dependence on technology which is not infallible highlights the weakness of humans who become its slaves rather its masters. Ultimately the stark choice between life and death, between fiction and reality can become blurred when cut off from the world inside a deep sea submarine.  How many times has this happened one can only wonder.  Since we are all here it can be assummed that the CExcO portrayed by Denzel Washington always won or the type of persons portrayed by Hackman do not exist.  Good triumphed over evil.\n\nI wonder what happened to the men who mutineered, they seem to have been forgiven, for an offence still punishable by death, at least in the British navy.  It's easy to criticise many technical mistakes in the film and some of the improbabilities but the main points were made and shown well. This film rates just as high as Red October, which was of a similar theme but also excellent.  I wonder if Burt Lancaster ever sees these films?  In its day Run Silent Run Deep had a lot to recommend it, but that is for another Comment at another time when I see it again"}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Crimson Tide", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi247398425", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1NjYwMzMtZGQ3NC00OWIyLWFjNjMtZTU1YWEzODg5ZTRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1NjYwMzMtZGQ3NC00OWIyLWFjNjMtZTU1YWEzODg5ZTRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT#2", "uploadDate": "2008-08-28T03:09:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000243/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Denzel Washington"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112740/characters/nm0000243?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hunter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0002023/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matt Craven"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112740/characters/nm0002023?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Zimmer"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001557/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Viggo Mortensen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112740/characters/nm0001557?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Weps"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0140969/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Rocky Carroll"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112740/characters/nm0140969?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lt.

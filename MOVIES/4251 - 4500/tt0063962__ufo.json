But when that thing you do is so delieriously unique, that's understandable. In 1970, the \"UFO\" series was end of an era. It was the last production to carry the legend A GERRY ANDERSON CENTURY 21 PRODUCTION. With the passing of his studio operation, a little of the magic fell away from the Anderson production line. Certainly the loss of Derek Meddings was noticeable on \"Space:1999\" which has some wonderfil model work (courtesy of Martin Bower) but found the talents of Brian Johnson (SPX) lacking the elan and sophistication of Meddings. You only have to see a UFO exploding and compare that to an Eagle doing likewise to see that, when it came to the big pyrotechnic display, Meddings really was the master. \"UFO\" was the greatest work the Century 21 team ever produced. By the end of the 26 epsode run it had progressed from a slightly plodding live action take on \"Captain Scarlet\" to become one of the best science fiction series over produced in the UK, period. Check out the deranged final 9 episodes for proof of this. They are almost as good as \"The Prisoner\" in their way. If you haven't discovered the series yet, or haven't seen it for many years, now is most certainly the time. The new DVDs from Carlton show \"UFO\" in a shimmering new light. It was quite simply one of the best looking series ever made. So, welcome back \"UFO\" and thank you Gerry and Sylvia making our childhoods that little bit sweeter."}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0084042/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Ed Bishop"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0063962/characters/nm0084042?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Cmdr.

Yet when you see the things that happen to this poor girl your eyes don't want to stop watching but in the back of your mind you're thinking why? Then you remember during portions of this movie that it was based on actual events and when the credits roll you're hit with this overwhelming since of sadness and grief that makes you want to tell your parent or parents that you love them and that you're thankful for them. While your mind processes what you've just seen it's hard because it's so shocking and real and you want to shout at the top of your lungs SAVE THIS GIRL! I guess it could just be me but it had powerful emotional effect on me. I've seen other movies about true stories but other than Schindler's List nothing had such an impact until now. There was a Lifetime movie that made me angry and sickened me that turned out was fictional that I wished they would have said before the movie began its not based on actual events. My advice is if you think you can handle the emotions you'll feel after this movie then watch it. If you don't think you can, then watch it with another person. The overall sad and disturbing fact was this movie was based on a true story. I guess that makes it all the more scary.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "An American Crime", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2850291993", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU4NWZhMjYtNGM1Mi00NDlhLTg1MWItMzk0YmQ2Y2RjZWZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU4NWZhMjYtNGM1Mi00NDlhLTg1MWItMzk0YmQ2Y2RjZWZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from First Look", "uploadDate": "2008-05-29T14:47:30Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0680983/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Elliot Page"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0680983?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sylvia Likens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0780678/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Nick Searcy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0780678?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lester Likens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001416/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Catherine Keener"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0001416?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Gertrude Baniszewski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0174021/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Scout Taylor-Compton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0174021?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Stephanie Baniszewski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1505370/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hannah Leigh"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm1505370?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Shirley Baniszewski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001574/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Michael O'Keefe"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0001574?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Reverend Bill Collier"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0070906/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Michelle Benes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0070906?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Hope Orbach"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3043177/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Calvin Keet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm3043177?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mr. Doyle"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2201055/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hayley McFarland"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm2201055?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jennie Likens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0741891/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Romy Rosemont"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0741891?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Betty Likens"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0310966/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Ari Graynor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0310966?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Paula Baniszewski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1363701/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tristan Jarred"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm1363701?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Johnny Baniszewski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0925966/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Bradley Whitford"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0925966?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Prosecutor"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0922668/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Carlie Westerman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0922668?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Marie Baniszewski"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0686344/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Patricia Place"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0802948/characters/nm0686344?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mrs. Doyle"}]}]}

It is character driven and has compelling dialog between Lynley and Sgt Havers. Havers is the real star of the show. She has very real problems in addition to working with her ponce of a boss. She lives paycheck to paycheck while caring for her parents, who suffer from dementia. How she juggles this situation with the need to be seconded to different locations to work on cases creates real angst in her character. In comparison, Lynley's problems are more social, as he frequently moralizes over dilemmas in his love life. Still, the rich detective and the hardscrabble sergeant work well with one another while solving cases that are twisty and intelligent. Like CSI, many of the cases are fashioned after recent cases in the news, so to say they are far fetched is not true. Try it out. You'll like the series.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries: Disc 10", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1078966809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDkyYmEyNGYtNzdlNS00N2VlLWEyMmEtODZiYjA0NTUxODI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDkyYmEyNGYtNzdlNS00N2VlLWEyMmEtODZiYjA0NTUxODI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries: Disc 10", "uploadDate": "2019-03-13T18:24:03Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0662511/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Nathaniel Parker"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988820/characters/nm0662511?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Thomas Lynley"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2001-2007"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0895991/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Lesley Vickerage"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988820/characters/nm0895991?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Helen Clyde"}, {"url": "#", "name": "10 episodes, 2002-2004"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0806527/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sharon Small"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0988820/characters/nm0806527?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Barbara Havers"}, {"url": "#", "name": "23 episodes, 2001-2007"}]}]}

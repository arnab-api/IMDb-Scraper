I, apparently like many viewers, did not give this show a chance during its first run. I recently discovered it in reruns at 11:30 p.m. and fell in love with the show. Have you seen any of the current sit-coms? None of them (at least with my minimal cable access) can even elicit a smile out of me, and I'm a fairly easy audience. \"Christine\" is so refreshing, and now it's gone! I can't find it on anywhere, but I couldn't let it go without giving it my applause in print. What this show had was a great comedic cast, and what made them great was their dialog AND delivery. Few entertainers have what I call good comedic timing. It's the difference between Johnny Carson and Jay Leno, and I don't think it can be taught. For the actors on \"Christine,\" the comedy seemed to come naturally, and the timing was perfect. I'm sorry it took me so long to pay attention, and I'm so grateful for all the laughs. If I can buy these shows on DVD, I'll just have to re-re-re-re- run them all.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The New Adventures Of Old Christine: Season 5", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4242062617", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVlZmZlMDAtZTU5NS00YzZkLWI0ZTgtY2ZkYWE4NjEwMDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVlZmZlMDAtZTU5NS00YzZkLWI0ZTgtY2ZkYWE4NjEwMDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The New Adventures Of Old Christine: Season 5", "uploadDate": "2019-04-05T15:30:35Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000506/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0462128/characters/nm0000506?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Christine Campbell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0512934/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hamish Linklater"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0462128/characters/nm0512934?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Matthew Kimble"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0752005/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Emily Rutherfurd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0462128/characters/nm0752005?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Christine 'New Christine' Hunter"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0395088/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Alex Kapp"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0462128/characters/nm0395088?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Lindsay"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0163988/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Clark Gregg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0462128/characters/nm0163988?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Richard Campbell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1481133/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Trevor Gagnon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0462128/characters/nm1481133?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Ritchie Campbell"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0641518/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Tricia O'Kelley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0462128/characters/nm0641518?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Marly Ehrhardt"}, {"url": "#", "name": "88 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0843100/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Wanda Sykes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0462128/characters/nm0843100?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Barb Baran"}, {"url": "#", "name": "67 episodes, 2006-2010"}]}]}

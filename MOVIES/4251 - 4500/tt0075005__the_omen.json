It isn't gory, it doesn't have sex, it is just plain terrifying. Everything about the movie contributes to feel of the movie. Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score, the great acting, the cinematography and the scary as hell ending.\n\nIt's the 6th hour on the 6th day of the 6th month. Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) has just found out his newborn son is dead. He can't let his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) know though, since it would devastate her. But when a priest offers him another newborn whose mother died, all problems are solved, they name him Damien.....\n\nThe Omen is one of my favourite horror films. When I first saw it, it scared the living hell out of me. The score, done by Jerry Goldsmith is now one of the most famous horror movie scores. It sets the mood and sends a chill up your spine. The acting is outstanding (especially Billie Whitelaw as Mrs. Baylock). Gregory Peck and Lee Remick are, as usual, fantastic. Billie Whitelaw is pretty much flawless as the evil nanny and Harvey Stephens, although he doesn't say much, is very good as little Damien.\n\nThe last thing that makes the movie scary are some of the most bizarre deaths. The most known of them is a decapitation which is one of the scariest deaths in horror history.\n\n5/5.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Omen (1976)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2750873881", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdhNDdhMzItYzJmYS00OWZlLWFiZWItN2ZlZWFmZWUxMGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdhNDdhMzItYzJmYS00OWZlLWFiZWItN2ZlZWFmZWUxMGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:00:24Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000060/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gregory Peck"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0000060?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Thorn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001831/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "David Warner"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0001831?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Keith Jennings"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0827032/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Harvey Stephens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0827032?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Damien"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0072578/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Martin Benson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0072578?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Father Spiletto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0240961/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Tommy Duggan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0240961?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Priest"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0629458/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Anthony Nicholls"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0629458?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dr. Becker"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0101886/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Roy Boyd"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0101886?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Reporter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0713520/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sheila Raynor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0713520?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Mrs. Horton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001665/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lee Remick"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0001665?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Katherine Thorn"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0925794/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Billie Whitelaw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0925794?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Mrs. Baylock"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0873743/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Patrick Troughton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0873743?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Father Brennan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0726403/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Robert Rietty"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0726403?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Monk"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0834438/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "John Stride"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0834438?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "The Psychiatrist"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0657353/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Holly Palance"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0657353?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nanny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0235782/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Freda Dowie"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0075005/characters/nm0235782?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Nun"}]}]}

This series is filmed in Canada in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia. The series is well-written in a different story each week. Some are little out there but most of the time it is the quality of the story telling. I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species. It's funny how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth. The stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "DVD Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi27181337", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc3ZTZjNWMtYzIyZC00YjY1LWJlN2MtYTcxNjMwZjBiYjhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc3ZTZjNWMtYzIyZC00YjY1LWJlN2MtYTcxNjMwZjBiYjhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-10-02T11:38:19Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0176723/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Kevin Conway"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0112111/characters/nm0176723?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Control Voice"}, {"url": "#", "name": "119 episodes, 1995-2002"}]}]}

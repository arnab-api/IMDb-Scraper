This one, as others have said IS better and I'll tell you why. In Titanic we have just one story going, where as in this one we have several. The subtle budding romance between Nonnie and Mr. Martin was very interesting to watch. I thought they were a rather odd pairing at first, but it worked seeing how they both needed each other. Linda Rogo was my favorite character. She knew what to say and how to say it. She even told her pompus husband off a few times. The fact that she's an ex-prostitute and her husband being the cop that arrested her made their story rather interesting. Mr. Rogo and the Preacher's quarrels were amusing and heated. I liked the Rosens, they were the strong ones and you could truly see the love they had for one another. The kid was annoying, but useful and I really enjoyed the sexual tension between Susan and the Preacher. Their scenes were my favorite. This movie has a cast of truly rich characters that were more entertaining to watch than the actual effects. Ah! The good old days where character development and an actual plot outweigh the special effects and the disaster itself. 9 out of 10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Poseidon Adventure", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1190265113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJjZWQxMGEtNDNjNy00ZjA1LWEzNDYtZTE2NmU5NzYxMmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJjZWQxMGEtNDNjNy00ZjA1LWEzNDYtZTE2NmU5NzYxMmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:42:28Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000432/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Gene Hackman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0000432?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Reverend Scott"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000999/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Red Buttons"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0000999?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "James Martin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001522/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Roddy McDowall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0001522?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Acres"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001859/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Shelley Winters"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0001859?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Belle Rosen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0552863/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Pamela Sue Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0552863?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Susan Shelby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0790272/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Eric Shea"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0790272?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Robin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0021052/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Sheila Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0021052?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Nurse"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0916843/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Byron Webster"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0916843?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Purser"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000308/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ernest Borgnine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0000308?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mike Rogo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0528595/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carol Lynley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0528595?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Nonnie Parry"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001771/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Stella Stevens"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0001771?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Linda Rogo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0016776/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jack Albertson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0016776?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Manny Rosen"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0640023/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Arthur O'Connell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0640023?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chaplain"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0755589/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Fred Sadoff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0755589?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Linarcos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0038066/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jan Arvan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0069113/characters/nm0038066?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Doctor Caravello"}]}]}

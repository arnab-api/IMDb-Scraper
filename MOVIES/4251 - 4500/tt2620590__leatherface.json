When the prisoners revolt, a small group make a bid for freedom with pretty nurse Lizzy (Vanessa Grasse) and fellow inmate Jackson as their hostages.\n\nTobe Hooper's original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ranks as one of the scariest films ever made, its iconic killer Leatherface its most frightening creation. With this latest film in the series, they've gone and done what Rob Zombie did with his godawful Halloween remake: give the killer a back story. In humanising the character, they have lessened his effectiveness as an object of fear. Once an emotionless, uncontrollable monster, impossible to reason with, he is now someone we can identify with and feel a level of pity for. It didn't work for Michael Myers and it doesn't work here.\n\nThe origins story-line also makes much of the film seem frustratingly unlike a Texas Chainsaw movie, at times even reminding me of a Tarantino flick (the escape from Gorman House made me think of Natural Born Killers while the BBQ stop massacre was redolent of both NBK and Pulp Fiction). Only in the film's closing moments do things actually feel like they belong to the franchise, with Lizzy trying to escape the Sawyer's charnel house, a chainsaw wielding Jed (soon to become Leatherface) hot on her heels. Directors Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury don't hold back on the brutality and blood, but even so, I can imagine many fans of the series being disappointed with the level of splatter (too much for some, not enough for others).\n\n5.5 out of 10, rounded down to 5 for that really dumb scene in which three people (including one really fat guy) hide from the law by climbing inside the festering carcass of a steer. A really big steer. Also, minus half a point for the unbelievable necro sex scene. And another half point subtracted for Jed's sudden (and also completely unbelievable) transformation from rational human being to hulking homicidal maniac.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3156588825", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQ4OWVhYjctYzM1Ni00NTA4LTkyMWMtYTNmMDE2MzYzYWJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQ4OWVhYjctYzM1Ni00NTA4LTkyMWMtYTNmMDE2MzYzYWJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A teenage Leatherface escapes from a mental hospital with three other inmates, kidnapping a young nurse and taking her on a road trip from hell while being pursued by an equally deranged lawman out for revenge.", "uploadDate": "2017-08-09T04:27:40Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001151/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Stephen Dorff"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm0001151?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Hal Hartman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5307635/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sam Strike"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm5307635?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Jackson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3645691/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Finn Jones"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm3645691?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Deputy Sorells"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7289044/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Jessica Madsen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm7289044?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Clarice"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0011478/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Christopher Adamson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm0011478?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Dr. Lang"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7724402/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Nathan Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm7724402?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Farnsworth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm6952275/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Boris Kabakchiev"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm6952275?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Young Jed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5691704/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Hristo Milev"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm5691704?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Young Nubbins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000666/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lili Taylor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm0000666?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Verna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm7149890/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Vanessa Grasse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm7149890?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Lizzy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4744043/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Sam Coleman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm4744043?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Bud"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5914751/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "James Bloor"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm5914751?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Ike"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2817670/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dimo Alexiev"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm2817670?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Drayton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1854392/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dejan Angelov"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm1854392?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Nubbins"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm5189714/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Lorina Kamburova"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt2620590/characters/nm5189714?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Betty"}]}]}

Honestly, the science fiction genre always commands a great deal of latitude with me. Normally I will overlook the occasional bout of predictability, even certain production fails or FX faux-pas, remaining ever optimistic that things will all pan out in the end. Add the names and backing behind Terra Nova and I truly assumed great things would be forthcoming. So I've forced myself to watch every episode.\n\nHaving said that...\n\nThis show insults the intelligence of any sci fi fan. Actually, it insults the intelligence of my 7 year old boy. It is easily the largest bag full of character/story arc clich\u00e9s I've seen since I forced myself through a few 'Leave It To Beaver' episodes when I was 12 and sent home from school sick with the flu. The show is crap, 100%. And sorry folks, but the FX are also just... completely... awful. Barney the Dinosaur looks more realistic than some of that CG work. Just awful. Of course I can easily expect a network to be found guilty of such ineptitude in creative decision making, but I just can't believe that Steven Spielberg would lend his name or studio to this brand of nonsense.\n\nI really would like to go mental here, explaining in many paragraphs, the many levels of FAIL this show is responsible for, but now that I think about it - what's the point? Anyone with a palette for good TV, sci fi or not - will watch 5 minutes of 1 episode of this sugary sap and instantly know what kind of horse manure it is. Hell, I can't even describe the show as predictable or mundane - even though it certainly is all of that and more. The show can only be properly described in one word... HORRIBLE.\n\nIf my IQ were under 60, or perhaps if I was 6 years old, this might be slightly entertaining, maybe. On second thought, nope, it would still suck.\n\nI can only feel sorry for the actors, in that I felt Jason O'Mara had some acting chops (Life On Mars US), and Steven Lang ... well... Steven Lang has tenure and street cred IMO. But having said that, the acting, even from the stars, it is SO terribly over the top and just ...well... cheapish. I mean, really, really, cheapish, in a 70's Charlie's Angels/original Star Trek pilot episode kinda way. Speaking of the original Star Trek, all of the fight scenes I've had the displeasure of watching in Terra Nova are eerily reminiscent of the cheesy, over-the-top Captain Kirk vs. *insert Alien here* fights everyone on planet Earth has had enough of. I can only assume that the actors looked at these horrid scripts and decided to save their skills for REAL writing.\n\nI honestly wonder why a studio/network would waste so much time, effort, and money on what amounts to a poor and seemingly hurried mash up of Swiss Family Robinson + Dinotopia. There are so many original story ideas floating around these days, SO many talented young writers and producers who would much better serve the attention of Steven Spielberg and Amblin Entertainment. Those up-and-comers deserve a platform like network TV to showcase quality material and serve the future of their creative talents. The folks writing and producing Terra Nova? These folks aren't investing 1% of talent to the show. Sorry but this show deserves nothing but to be canceled, as quickly as possible, in the hopes that someone at Fox will grow a clue and seek out proper writers and producers the next time around. It's just a big colossal waste of time for everyone, from the producers and actors right down the line to the viewers - such as myself - who gave it every chance to succeed.\n\nOne question though, how does this creative drivel garner a 7 out of 10 rating here at IMDb? Has the viewing public been that dumbed down? I haven't checked other reviews r.e. Terra Nova yet, but I truly hope that I don't see too many \"it's a good show\" comments or I swear I will lose all hope in humanity.\n\nShame on whatever genius it was who made the final decision to let schlock writing like this get picked from the trash bin and produced.

At any rate it was way ahead of its time in 1959. \"Sleeping Beauty\" was one of the movies I watched as a child, and its grandness overwhelmed me even at the age of ten. I couldn't be happier to see it finally in the DVD format. But watch closely; you'll notice many subtle, sophisticated things which other viewers have touched on in earlier reviews. The animation is almost surreal-- so incredibly lifelike that it abandons its cute, 'Disneyesque' pretensions from previous fairy tales. There are no talking mice, dogs or cats anywhere to be seen. Here the animals are silent, as animals are supposed to be. (I love the sequence with the forest animals as they are awakened by the singing of the barefoot princess and join up with her, like multiple chaperons, in harmonious whistles.) Even the fairy godmothers- who may initially appear as sugary stereotypes- spend so much time bickering (well, two of them do anyway) that you get to identify them as thoroughly fleshed out personalities. The adaptation of the original Perrault fairy tale is also impressive. An ingenious move was to have the prince and princess meet in the forest *first* and fall in love- unaware that they are already engaged to be married. Someone mentioned the chilling sequence which shows the princess, cloaked in an eerie green pallor, actually being lured to the fateful spinning wheel. So dark, so frightening- when was the last time you saw something like this in a Disney fairy tale? And then immediately afterwords is a cleansing sequence of unmatched beauty showing the fairies sailing through the sky like fireflies, magically dusting the rest of the castle to sleep. It is, of course, only matched by the film's finale which shows storm clouds, lightning, a forest of thorns, and a flame-spewing dragon-- all seamlessly bringing the story to a 75-minute conclusion. It stands, in my opinion, as Disney's masterpiece.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H15M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sleeping Beauty: Diamond Edition", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2753998105", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNmM2MyMDgtNWJmNC00MWM5LWIzYmItZTcyZDYzNTRjMjczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODNmM2MyMDgtNWJmNC00MWM5LWIzYmItZTcyZDYzNTRjMjczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT 1A", "uploadDate": "2014-05-13T04:57:46Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0182250/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Mary Costa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0182250?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Princess Aurora"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0041598/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Eleanor Audley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0041598?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Maleficent"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0524853/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Barbara Luddy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0524853?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Merryweather"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0392067/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Taylor Holmes"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0392067?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "King Stefan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0794301/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Bill Shirley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0794301?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Prince Phillip"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0271658/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Verna Felton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0271658?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Flora"}, {"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0271658?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Queen Leah"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0020289/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Barbara Jo Allen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0020289?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Fauna"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0859892/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bill Thompson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0053285/characters/nm0859892?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "King Hubert"}]}]}

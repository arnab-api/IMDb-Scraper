This movie brought many of the scenes to life, adding in one new one that contributed to the drama. The movie did a decent amount of justice to the characters in the book by Arthur Golden.\n\nAlthough many things were left out of this movie, which happens with every movie that you turn into a book, it was very well done. John Williams did a beautiful job with the score, and the sets were elaborate and beautiful. There were a few technical aspects of the costuming and makeup that were wrong, but one would only notice if they were well versed in the culture of the geisha. If all you know about Geisha is that they wear white make-up and kimono, then you shouldn't have a problem with the minor details of the costuming and make up. They are both delightful, even if they are wrong in some circumstances.\n\nAs being one who does not know the difference between the Asian actors (meaning if they are Chinese, Japanese...etc), I thought they all did a wonderful job of portraying the characters. The actors and actresses bring the characters from Golden's book to life.\n\nIt was a delightful movie. I highly suggest it to everyone to see. There is romance, drama, a touch of comedy, and a look into the world of the Geisha. Although, it is only a tiny glance, as the world of the Geisha is much more complex than anyone could ever imagine, it brings this secret world of Kyoto to life.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Memoirs of a Geisha", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2073624857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MxYTRlNDEtZmE4My00NjUwLWI0ZTktMjgwNzNhNzI5YTM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MxYTRlNDEtZmE4My00NjUwLWI0ZTktMjgwNzNhNzI5YTM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer 1", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:14:00Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1797214/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Suzuka Ohgo"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm1797214?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Chiyo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0538683/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mako"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm0538683?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Sakamoto"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0839287/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Elizabeth Sung"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm0839287?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Sakamoto's Wife"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000084/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Li Gong"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm0000084?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Hatsumomo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0597390/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Kaori Momoi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm0597390?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Mother"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2089465/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David Okihiro"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm2089465?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Shamisen Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0442843/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Kotoko Kawamura"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm0442843?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Granny"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1067699/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Eugenia Yuan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm1067699?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Korin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0407033/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Togo Igawa"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm0407033?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Tanaka"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1789162/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Samantha Futerman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm1789162?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Satsu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0407463/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Thomas Ikeda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm0407463?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Mr. Bekku"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0157796/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Tsai Chin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm0157796?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Auntie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1494624/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Zoe Weizenbaum"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm1494624?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Young Pumpkin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2089668/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Miyako Tachibana"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm2089668?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dance Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1400085/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Karl Yune"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0397535/characters/nm1400085?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Koichi"}]}]}

I was about six when I first started watching it. I was enthralled by the action and the feats that this man could perform. He had a bionic right arm, two bionic legs, and a bionic eye that could enable him to see great distances.  His strength was more than that of ten men.  He could run faster than a car and he was a super intelligence agent. Along the way he meets a variety of interesting characters and ones that I have never forgotten about.  There was Barney, the seven million dollar man who lets his bionics take over his mind and he uses them for his own benefits instead of that of his agency.  Then there was the probe.  The probe was a machine that was designed to go to space but never made it there.  On Earth, it wreaks havoc and Steve has his hands full with it. Then of course there was Jamie Summers.  She was Steve's girlfriend that has a tragic parachuting accident.  Steve, blinded by love demands that she is given bionics.  She receives them but she has amnesia.  There love is tragically put on hold and it is this plot line that for the first time in my young life, I was taught about the power and tragedy of love.\n\nBut the best of all the episodes of Steve Austin was the one's centering around Bigfoot.  This also introduced the world to Andre The Giant.  The Bigfoot episodes were scary.  Here is this huge creature that is also bionic and he is a little stronger, a little faster and a little more vicious than Steve Austin.  It is some of the best T.V. I've ever seen and it is one that will have a lasting impression on me for the rest of my life.\n\nI remember that I asked my mom how they did all those things.  How a man could jump that high, how he could lift a car and such.  It was then that my parents explained to me that this was all make believe.  That this is what is known as magic.  Well it was from that moment on that the movies and TV captured my imagination.  And for that I will be eternally greatful to The Six Million Dollar Man."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Six Million Dollar Man", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi840875289", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZhNjg1MWUtYzQwNC00ODEyLTljYTQtNWEzOWE2MmQxOGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZhNjg1MWUtYzQwNC00ODEyLTljYTQtNWEzOWE2MmQxOGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Six Million Dollar Man", "uploadDate": "2019-04-11T21:16:58Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000516/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lee Majors"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0071054/characters/nm0000516?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Col.

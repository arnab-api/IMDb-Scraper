Robert Conrad was James West &Ross Martin was Artemus Gordon, \"Man of a thousand faces\".It had different stories each week but there were recurring villains- Dr. Miguelito Loveless ( What a great name for a villain !) was played by Michael Dunn ( Star Trek's\" Plato's Step-Children\") &Count Manzeppi (magician turned assassin) was played by Victor Buono. \"Wild, Wild West\" was the closest TV ever got to capturing the flavor of comic books. I hope you will someday get to see this series, perhaps on DVD. There are a few episodes out on video. I particularly recommend \" The Night the Wizard Shook the Earth\", the first Dr. Loveless episode. I loved the  Dr. Loveless episodes & the 2 with Victor Buono as Count Manzeppi. Quintessential \"Wild, Wild West \"episode- \"Night of the Vicious Valentine\" that deservedly won guest-star Agnes Moorehead an Emmy."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1627700761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyYjRlYTEtMDNlMC00NWVjLTg3ODMtZGM0MjFiOGVjNDYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyYjRlYTEtMDNlMC00NWVjLTg3ODMtZGM0MjFiOGVjNDYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two Secret Service Agents, equipped with a wide array of gizmos, work for the government in the Old West.", "uploadDate": "2020-07-08T09:33:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001066/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Robert Conrad"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058855/characters/nm0001066?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jim West"}, {"url": "#", "name": "104 episodes, 1965-1969"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0553014/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ross Martin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0058855/characters/nm0553014?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Artemus Gordon"}, {"url": "#", "name": "104 episodes, 1965-1969"}]}]}

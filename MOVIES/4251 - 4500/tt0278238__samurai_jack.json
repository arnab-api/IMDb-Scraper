Not since the Batman series, or perhaps ever, has a American cartoon flaunted such daring visual bravado, intelligent cinematic storytelling, intense action, and a revolutionary spirit so confidently - it's a warmly welcomed shake-up to the monotonous humdrum continuum of TV animation in this country.  Genndy Tartakovsky (creator of Dexter's Laboratory) has captured lightning in a bottle with his latest brainchild, and in doing so has demolished the mold for cartoons both present and future.  Indeed, calling this show itself a cartoon seems somehow disrespectful and stereotypical.  Here, the freedom allowed by the medium brings the story of Jack and his vendetta against a millenial nemesis named Aku in the far future feverishly to life.  Every background, set piece, character, and detail are all strikingly imagined, almost shocking in their originality.  The minimalist nature of the animation itself gives the program a unique and powerful vitality, and the abstract and sometimes surreal stylization is unlike anything ever seen in cartoons.  Tartakovsky avoids the clunky and often lifeless quagmire of more detailed and lifelike approaches to action animation and instead opts for he intensity and impact of a comic book in motion, and the results are both awesome and beautiful.\n\nMore than anything else, Samurai Jack truly feels like a work of art, like something that is crafted rather than produced.  It's a testament to the fact that animation in the U.S. can be cutting edge, revolutionary, and mature.  Truth be told, I haven't been excited about a new television program in quite a while.  Time will tell, but Samurai Jack seems destined for masterpiece status - not only here in America, but quite possibly worldwide."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 5 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi185251353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjZmMDFkN2UtMGI5Ny00MDczLWI3OTktYmVjMmUwOWNkMmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjZmMDFkN2UtMGI5Ny00MDczLWI3OTktYmVjMmUwOWNkMmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The samurai who travels through time returns for a fifth season.", "uploadDate": "2017-02-07T11:55:59Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0482851/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Phil LaMarr"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0278238/characters/nm0482851?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Samurai Jack"}, {"url": "#", "name": "58 episodes, 2001-2017"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0538683/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Mako"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0278238/characters/nm0538683?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Aku"}, {"url": "#", "name": "25 episodes, 2001-2017"}]}]}

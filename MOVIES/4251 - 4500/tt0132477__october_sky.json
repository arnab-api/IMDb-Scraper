I did read a short story by Hickam which was apparently the seed that started him on the novel. It grabbed me even then.\n\nI am one of those fortunate enough to have lived adjacent to Cape Canaveral during the Mercury program, where my father worked, and this childhood situation no doubt fostered my lifelong interests and hobbies. I also met Werner von Braun, and one of the other German rocket scientists repaired a rubber band driven model plane I had (I WISH I still had that plane!) I mention this because I went into the movie with serious expectations and very much desired to see a film with authentic treatments for the nostalgia and emotions of the period.\n\nI was not disappointed. While there were superficial flaws here and there, the movie came together like so few Hollywood films do. Good storytelling, authentic emotions and period atmosphere. As others have experienced at this excellent film, I was choked up at the end and had to wipe away the tears. The father of the family next to me asked to borrow my spare paper napkin to wipe his tears. About half the audience applauded at the end, and most everyone stayed through the credits. It's just one of those films.\n\nNot the greatest movie ever made, but one of the best family movies in a long time."}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0350453/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jake Gyllenhaal"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0350453?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Homer Hickam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000368/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Laura Dern"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0000368?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Miss Riley"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005406/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "William Lee Scott"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0005406?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Roy Lee"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0133882/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Natalie Canerday"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0133882?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Elsie Hickam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0834616/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Randy Stripling"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0834616?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Leon Bolden"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0059946/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Elya Baskin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0059946?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ike Bykovsky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0245486/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "David Dwyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0245486?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Jake Mosby"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0391231/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Kaili Hollister"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0391231?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Valentine Carmina"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0177933/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Chris Cooper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0177933?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "John Hickam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0654104/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Chris Owen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0654104?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Quentin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0511349/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Chad Lindberg"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0511349?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "O'Dell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0587238/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Scott Thomas"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0587238?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Jim Hickam"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0254760/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Chris Ellis"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0254760?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Principal Turner"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0271747/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Courtney Cole-Fendley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0271747?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Dorothy Platt"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0521761/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Terry Loughlin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0132477/characters/nm0521761?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Mr. Dantzler"}]}]}

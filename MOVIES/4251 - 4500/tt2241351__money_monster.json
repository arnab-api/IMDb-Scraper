\u00a0And it is and as performed by Clooney, Gates and Roberts (more on her later), this had the makings of an interesting hostage drama with a cautionary tale of our voyeuristic tendencies of watching tragedy unfold on live TV. \u00a0Unfortunately, MONEY MONSTER isn't that interested in that story. \u00a0It tacks on a conspiracy plot by the tanking company led by a smiling, well-coiffed CEO that has \"nothing to hide\" that just screams \"I HAVE EVERYTHING TO HIDE\". \u00a0As played by Dominic West, all this CEO was missing was tying the girl to the train tracks and twirling his mustache.\n\nProfessionally directed by Jodie Foster, I was excited for this movie and the scenes in the studios between Clooney and Roberts (reunited for the first time since OCEAN'S 11 and 12). \u00a0The scenes between these two\u00a0had a spark in them that I haven't seen from Clooney\u00a0in a long time - I credit Roberts (and Foster) for enabling Clooney to bring his A (or maybe his A-) game. \u00a0As far as Roberts is concerned, I think she is having a career renaissance (check out her work in last year's THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES). \u00a0It was fun to watch these two veterans chew the scenery with each other.\u00a0 These two are surrounded by some fun\u00a0characters in the TV studio, especially \"that guy\" character actor Lenny Venito as the lead cameraman and Christopher Dehnham as a beleaguered producer who is given all the \"crap\" jobs to do. \u00a0The interplay between them all are fun and it sets up\u00a0an interesting world that I want to spend time in. \u00a0And when the gunman crashes the party, I was interested.\n\nUnfortunately, where this movie doesn't succeed is when it decides to move away from the studio and it's interesting characters and focus on a generic Corporation with generic characters that is hiding a generic\u00a0conspiracy. \u00a0And that's too bad,\u00a0\u00a0for Director Foster and Writer Jamie Linden waste some really good talent - most notably the Police Captain played by Giancarlo Esposito and a corporate flunky played by the always slimy Dennis Boutsikaris who all but disappears from this film after the 1/3 portion. \u00a0They had the makings of a really good, really interesting film, but, instead turned it into a decent and watchable entertainment that shows us what true\u00a0\"MOVIE STARS\" George Clooney and Julia Roberts still are.\n\n6 1/2 \u00a0(out of 10) stars, but I'll tack on 1/2\u00a0more stars for the re-emergence of Clooney and Roberts, so \"officially\" a 7 (out of 10) starred movie and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3048191257", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NTA3MjUyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg5MjA3NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NTA3MjUyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg5MjA3NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Lee Gates (George Clooney) is a bombastic TV personality whose popular financial network show has made him the money wiz of Wall Street.

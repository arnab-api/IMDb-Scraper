About young love Henry (Austin Abrams) joining a newspaper class as a editor in chief. Along with Grace (Lili Reinhart) which she has a limp and a past she cant get over. When Henry and Grace partner up in class. Henry falls for her. As Grace is stubborn about opening up.\n\nIt is a decent story. About young love, grief, and loss. Which will say i also liked about it. Which is not a predictable love story. It does get kind of boring with Henry and Grace going back and forth with there love for each other.\n\nThe cast ensemble was decent. Lili Reinhart delivered a great performance as Grace. Austin Abrams was decent as Henry. The direction is a bit dull with the romantic drama. Which could have been more emotionally moving. The script was lacking the emotional depth with the characters and the content it was going through.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1348517401", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM0MzE4NmUtM2Q2Yy00N2M5LWI1YWUtZjM5MTYxNzU1ZWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM0MzE4NmUtM2Q2Yy00N2M5LWI1YWUtZjM5MTYxNzU1ZWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Seventeen-year-old Henry Page (Austin Abrams) has never been in love.

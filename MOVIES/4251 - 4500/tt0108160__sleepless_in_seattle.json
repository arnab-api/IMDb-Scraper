To fall in love with just a voice and a story, never seeing nor knowing who it is?", "reviewBody": "A love story between two ends of a continent and a story that is unique during its time, a story of love and chance that would make the female romantics stomachs turn. Certain movies will indeed last a life time. Some maybe as powerful as FORREST GUMP, some can bring to life a tragedy that came upon the unsinkable vessel THE TITANIC, some movies can be considered as the next step in cinematography as THE GLADIATOR and then there are those few whose names remain but the story is forgotten with time such as SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE. However every-time you do push that DVD in your player, it is certain that it will move you and reach out to you just as much as it did the very first time.\n\nTom Hanks who stole your heart away as Forrest and who showed true grit in taking on the solo role of Chuck in CAST AWAY is always remembered fondly by his fans for those magical characters he played. Meg Ryan the Venus of the 90s was probably in every romcom that made a mark back then. SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, YOU'VE GOT MAIL, CITY OF ANGELS & WHEN MAN LOVES a WOMAN is titles that cannot be forgotten if you are indeed a fan of the genre. Ryan and Hanks in one of the very earliest of their performances together scores a near perfect score with SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.\n\nIt is said that there is no greater gift than the gift of love. Indeed it's true. We all have an emotional connection in our lives to someone that is entirely unexplainable. It's a connection on a platonic level unlike the attraction of lust. This value of love has been misread entirely in Hollywood of today and movies with such innocent intentions are quite rare. SIS by director Norah Ephron holds onto the idea of platonic love. It in-fact personifies the mere idea of such platonic connections between two people. Norah Ephron who has a knack for movies of this category certainly takes her work to heart. It is indeed evident primarily with her preference on always casting Meg Ryan. Next it's the very seasonal touch (most movies are set during the holiday season) she adds onto them and then the medium she uses to bring her lovers together. Two individuals who have never seen nor heard of each other falls in love over a radio show and in another instance rivals in business who falls in love in a chat room. With due credit to the writers who conjured the scripts; BRAVO! \n\nSam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) and his 8 year old son Jonah Baldwin (Ross Malinger) are hit by surprise when their wife/mother Maggie is suddenly passes away. Devastated by the loss of his wife Sam and son Jonah leaves Chicago and moves all the way to Seattle with the hopes of moving on and beginning a new life. 18 months down the line Sam is still mourning the loss of Maggie and is unable to function an inch beyond her memories. Young Jonah who is smart for his age understands his fathers' grief and wishes only to see him happy. On Christmas eve Jonah calls in on a radio talk show and explains to the host his fathers' situation and subsequently Sam ends up on the phone pouring his heart out over the air of his love for Maggie. Sam is heard all over country to those who are tuned in, Including Annie (Meg Ryan) who is driving over to her fianc\u00e9s parents' home for Christmas Eve dinner. Annie who unconsciously forms a liking towards Sam over the days lose focus on Walter (Bill Pullman); her fianc\u00e9 and is totally hung up on a stranger she has never met nor seen all her life. Is that even possible? To fall in love with just a voice and a story, never seeing nor knowing who it is?\n\nTitle: SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE Directed by: Norah Ephron Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Bill Pullman and Ross Maligner Rated: PG for some language Rating: 7.5/10 105 Minutes", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi727367449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWVkYjM2MjAtYzY1ZC00MDE4LThjZTQtOGRkYjYzMDdkZTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWVkYjM2MjAtYzY1ZC00MDE4LThjZTQtOGRkYjYzMDdkZTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-02-04T20:37:23Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000158/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Tom Hanks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0000158?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Sam Baldwin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001854/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Rita Wilson"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0001854?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Suzy"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0268356/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Tom Riis Farrell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0268356?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Rob"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000212/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Meg Ryan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0000212?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Annie Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0238956/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Le Clanch\u00e9 du Rand"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0238956?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Barbara Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001383/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "David Hyde Pierce"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0001383?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dennis Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0175814/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Frances Conroy"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0175814?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Irene Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0872821/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Calvin Trillin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0872821?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Uncle Milton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0539678/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Ross Malinger"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0539678?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jonah Baldwin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001255/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Victor Garber"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0001255?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Greg"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000508/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Carey Lowell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0000508?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Maggie Baldwin"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000597/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Bill Pullman"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0000597?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Walter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0641870/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Kevin O'Morrison"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0641870?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Cliff Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0942903/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Valerie Wright"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0942903?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Betsy Reed"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0848716/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Tom Tammi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0108160/characters/nm0848716?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Harold Reed"}]}]}

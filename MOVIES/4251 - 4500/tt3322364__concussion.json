Dr Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist, in Concussion, based on a true story, begins in 2002 the outside-of-the-league autopsies that will eventually expose the CTE impairment and other life-threatening results of the professional battering.\n\nAs gently and convincingly played by Will Smith, the doctor eventually gets the NFL and world's attention by scientifically exploring the dead bodies of former players. As in the tobacco wars, the corporation, in this case the league, denies any connection, but that stand is bound to deteriorate as devoted scientists and doctors who know the players are forced to admit the causal relationship.\n\nThe film is absorbing when it plays like a medical thriller, perhaps like something Michael Crichton would write in non science fiction. When Concussion tries to integrate the more melodramatic elements of Dr. Omalu's life such as his marriage and the couple's miscarriage, the film becomes mired in tears and melancholy, unfitting for a story worth telling about the professional struggle alone.\n\nConcussion's emphasis on the need for public awareness of the probable danger of tackle football is well presented, even though the NFL seems like a Bond villain's empire. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue started The Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury to explore the injuries and left the results with new commissioner, Roger Goodell.\n\nAlthough settlement for players ensued, the concussions are still around."}, "duration": "PT2H3M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi905228825", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MDc2MzcxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExODkyNzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MDc2MzcxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExODkyNzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Will Smith stars in a dramatic thriller based on the incredible true David vs. Goliath story of Dr. Bennet Omalu, the brilliant forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of CTE, a football-related brain trauma, in a pro player.", "uploadDate": "2015-11-19T10:42:53Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000226/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Will Smith"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0000226?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Dr. Bennet Omalu"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000983/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Albert Brooks"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0000983?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Dr. Cyril Wecht"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001556/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "David Morse"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0001556?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Mike Webster"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0005282/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Mike O'Malley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0005282?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Daniel Sullivan"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0004991/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Hill Harper"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0004991?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Christopher Jones"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0610459/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Stephen Moyer"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0610459?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Dr. Ron Hamilton"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0001663/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Paul Reiser"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0001663?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Dr. Elliot Pellman"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3935293/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Sara Lindsey"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm3935293?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Gracie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0000285/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Alec Baldwin"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0000285?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Dr. Julian Bailes"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1813221/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Gugu Mbatha-Raw"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm1813221?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Prema Mutiso"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0397124/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Arliss Howard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0397124?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Dr. Joseph Maroon"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0550371/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Eddie Marsan"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0550371?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Dr. Steve DeKosky"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0015382/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt3322364/characters/nm0015382?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Dave Duerson"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0429114/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Richard T.

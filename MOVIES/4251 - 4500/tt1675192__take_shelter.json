If you look hard enough you'll find small independent art films within any genre. Take Shelter is a film you will find amongst dramatic thrillers, and it is definitely one you should seek out. It stars Michael Shannon as Curtis, a middle class family man working on the pipeline in Ohio. He leads a capable life where he must cope with his monetary issues as well as his deaf daughter. But he makes the most of it and lives a life of relative ease and compassion for his family. However, things become complicated when he starts seeing apocalyptic visions of a terrible storm he believes is on its way. The dreams and visions make his life very difficult and it becomes increasingly more stressful. Curtis must fight a battle within himself as he tries to figure out if these visions are meaningful or if he is just going crazy, as well as with his family and friends who become more disconnected from him as his sanity seems to deteriorate before their eyes. Take Shelter is a harrowing, dramatic, and slow building film that will surely amaze you once it is all over.\n\nTake Shelter is a film that moves so slowly and builds so dramatically that one begins to wonder if we're every getting to the end. It's an incredibly quiet and sincerely somber film. We spend almost the entire movie honing in on Michael Shannon's powerful facial expressions and the deep thought going into the story. It progresses so slowly with a build up that pushes its way through molasses.\n\nI'll admit that I was getting worried about this film not being as good as I expected it to be. I was afraid it might not live up to my expectations and that the payoff wouldn't be worth the crawling build up. But one you reach the end you will be incredibly satisfied. The payoff is incredible. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. It could not have been executed more precisely. It plays to something bigger than what you could have ever expected from this fantastic film. Just as my mind began to slip away from Take Shelter it ended with such a deep and deafening bang that my eyes flew open to realize the incredible film I had just sat through.\n\nTake Shelter might not look like much at first, but it turns out to be a tremendous film. It's smart, engaging, fascinating, and brutally sincere. This is a must see film for 2011. Depending on your attention span you may want to give up about an hour and a half in, but if you stick around for the end you will be very satisfied. I guarantee it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Take Shelter", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3746995481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDkyODA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDkyODA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Plagued by a series of apocalyptic visions, a young husband and father questions whether to shelter his family from a coming storm, or from himself.", "uploadDate": "2011-05-26T08:10:13Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0788335/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Michael Shannon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm0788335?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Curtis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3964962/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Tova Stewart"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm3964962?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Hannah LaForche"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1737500/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Katy Mixon"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm1737500?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Nat"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2776898/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Ron Kennard"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm2776898?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Russell"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0519486/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Robert Longstreet"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm0519486?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Jim"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3252871/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Sheila Hullihen"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm3252871?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Woman in Road"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0015776/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Marianna Alacchi"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm0015776?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Bargain Hunter"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3163462/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Bob Maines"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm3163462?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Walter Jacobs"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1567113/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Jessica Chastain"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm1567113?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Samantha"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0924154/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Shea Whigham"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm0924154?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Dewart"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1551484/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Natasha Randall"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm1551484?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Cammie"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4094292/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Scott Knisley"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm4094292?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Lewis"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3365658/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Heather Caldwell"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm3365658?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Special Ed Teacher"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2147163/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "John Kloock"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm2147163?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Man in Road"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm4680579/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Jacque Jovic"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1675192/characters/nm4680579?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "News Anchor"}]}]}

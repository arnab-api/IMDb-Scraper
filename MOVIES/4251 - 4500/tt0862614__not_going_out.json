Watching the two series I have been compelled by the nature of the comedy-which I have accertained as a compromise between stand-up comedy and a sitcom. Rather than to shroud the characters true feelings, as has been done before, all characters speak their mind. This brings the result of a comedic 'battle' between them in which their unresolved disputes and generic arguments are turned to light-hearted funny quirks in the viewers perspective, as the drama unfolds for all those involved-namely for the unfortunate Lee, who seems to be at the tail-end of most decisions and seems to have most bad-luck. \n\nConclusively, I believe that the more unnatural stance on this genre is very effective for a wide audience, and makes a welcome change from your standard sitcom. Moreover, I believe that an entertaining show such as this does not need to develop further. As has happened in many American comedy shows, characters and plots have been killed off by over-running; but a good show should end whilst it is still laughed at and enjoyed by its viewers, as to bring it into a reputable class of British comedy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1056947/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lee Mack"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0862614/characters/nm1056947?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Lee"}, {"url": "#", "name": "87 episodes, 2006-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2360449/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Katy Wix"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0862614/characters/nm2360449?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Daisy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "41 episodes, 2007-2015"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0107988/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Sally Bretton"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0862614/characters/nm0107988?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Lucy"}, {"url": "#", "name": "81 episodes, 2007-2021"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0990104/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tim Vine"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt0862614/characters/nm0990104?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Tim"}, {"url": "#", "name": "35 episodes, 2006-2014"}]}]}

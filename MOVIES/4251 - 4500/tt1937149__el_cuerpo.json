The picture is thrilling and some moment brilliant , and the actors are quite reliable as Jose Coronado and Hugo Silva . And again a wonderful Belen Rueda as a nasty woman in a movie with intense sequences of tension and suspense . It deals with a veteran detective called Jaime Pe\u00f1a (Jose Coronado) searches for the body of a femme fatale (Belen Rueda is sensational in one of her best films along with \u00a8El Orfanato\u00a8) which has gone missing from a morgue . As main suspect there appears her husband Alex Ulloa (Hugo Silva) . Alex is detained and finding alone in the morgue , he is terrorized by strange events , surrounded by corpses and then weird deeds take place . \n\nThe film contains tension , thriller , drama , mystery , plot twists and shocks , including decent scares with tense sequences especially in its final part , in a unexpected denouement , near of the end . Hitchcock-style psychological thriller , being surprisingly good and compellingly realized . The original as well as entertaining idea is overspread throughout the movie , but not totally satisfactory , including conventional pitfalls . The main cast is frankly fine , such as Jos\u00e9 Coronado as Inspector Jaime Pe\u00f1a who bears a dark past , Hugo Silva as upsetting \u00c1lex Ulloa , Bel\u00e9n Rueda as Mayka Villaverde , a selfish and domineering woman and the young lover Aura Garrido as Carla . The motion picture is pretty well , although sometimes stagy and packs excessive turns ; however is entertaining for continuous suspense . Sinister and mysterious atmosphere plenty of lights and shades , it is finely photographed by cameraman Oscar Faura . Suspenseful and stirring musical score by Sergio Moure who previously composed successful films as \u00a8Unconscious\u00a8 and being expert on frightening atmosphere such as \u00a8Thesis on a Homicide\" and \u00a8Kidnapped\u00a8 . \n\nThe film was well produced by various producers , such as Joaquin Padro , Mar Targarona and Mercedes Gamero ; all of them have produced a lot of successes in the new Spanish cinema . Being professionally written and directed by Oriol Paulo who formerly realized only short movies and wrote \u00a8The Julia's eyes\u00a8 . The movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and Belen Rueda fans . Rating : Good , better than average . It's well worth watching and contains some really thrilling scenes and disturbing images .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Teaser tr\u00e1iler [OV]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2661857817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNlZDFiM2MtMjRjMC00MGExLTliMTMtNzM5MzFiYjJkZDkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNlZDFiM2MtMjRjMC00MGExLTliMTMtNzM5MzFiYjJkZDkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-10-05T14:27:26Z"}, "cast_and_character": [{"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0180580/?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jose Coronado"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm0180580?ref_=tt_cl_t1", "name": "Jaime Pe\u00f1a"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0749104/?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Bel\u00e9n Rueda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm0749104?ref_=tt_cl_t3", "name": "Mayka Villaverde"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1359601/?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Miquel Gelabert"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm1359601?ref_=tt_cl_t5", "name": "Vigilante \u00c1ngel Torres"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1073816/?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Oriol Vila"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm1073816?ref_=tt_cl_t7", "name": "Agente Mateos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1452334/?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Patr\u00edcia Bargall\u00f3"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm1452334?ref_=tt_cl_t9", "name": "Agente Norma"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0033003/?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "S\u00edlvia Aranda"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm0033003?ref_=tt_cl_t11", "name": "Ruth"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2165930/?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Pere Bras\u00f3"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm2165930?ref_=tt_cl_t13", "name": "Agente 3"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm2187826/?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Paco Moreno"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm2187826?ref_=tt_cl_t15", "name": "Agente Cient\u00edfica"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1281229/?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "Hugo Silva"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm1281229?ref_=tt_cl_t2", "name": "\u00c1lex Ulloa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm3467663/?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Aura Garrido"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm3467663?ref_=tt_cl_t4", "name": "Carla"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0795637/?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Juan Pablo Shuk"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm0795637?ref_=tt_cl_t6", "name": "Agente Pablo"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1272668/?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Carlota Olcina"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm1272668?ref_=tt_cl_t8", "name": "Erica Ulloa"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm1817195/?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Mia Esteve"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm1817195?ref_=tt_cl_t10", "name": "Luna Villaverde"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0240290/?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Manel Dueso"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm0240290?ref_=tt_cl_t12", "name": "Agente Carlos"}]}, {"actor": {"@type": "Person", "url": "/name/nm0520235/?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Albert L\u00f3pez-Murtra"}, "character_and_episodes": [{"url": "/title/tt1937149/characters/nm0520235?ref_=tt_cl_t14", "name": "Agente 4"}]}]}

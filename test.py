He goes to DC to meet her for the first time only to be told that she has been detained for treason. She had sent two investigators to Afganistan who were mysteriously killed. Her military lawyer is killed and Reacher is framed for it. While in detention, Reacher saves Turner from assassins and they escape. Meanwhile, a paternity claim against him has been filed by Candice Dayton for 15-year-old daughter Samantha whom he never met.\n\nThe story, the execution, and quite frankly the characters are rather robotic. It's not actually exciting but there is plenty of fight action. There is no mystery or shocking twists or interesting reveals. The big climatic twist is barely a twist. The story unfolds in a string of events that aren't terribly compelling. The bad guys are willing to kill as many people as needed but this is the kind of movie where they always come up a little short ending with a hand-to-hand fight. On the plus side, Smulders delivers a tough character without it all collapsing into a romantic puddle although it threatens to from time to time. This franchise keeps doing the hat thing but it's not filmed well. The point is for the character to disappear. It needs a scene where we lose track of Cruise (or Smulders in this one) in a crowd. That would be movie magic. In the grand scheme of things, this movie punches a lot but the hits rarely hurt. It's an action movie with limited thrills.", 'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating', 'worstRating': '1', 'bestRating': '10', 'ratingValue': '6'}}, 'duration': 'PT1H58M', 'trailer': {'@type': 'VideoObject', 'name': 'IMAX Trailer', 'embedUrl': '/video/imdb/vi4036933145', 'thumbnail': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'contentUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MjcyMjc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk3MTgxMDI@._V1_.jpg'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MjcyMjc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk3MTgxMDI@._V1_.jpg', 'description': 'Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name.
